<h1>Chapter 1680: The Calming Mantra</h1><p>Simultaneously locked onto by two Soul Formation powerhouses.</p><p>No one wanted to incur the wrath of two Soul Formation powerhouses.</p><p>No one dared to openly defy them, the key being the lack of confidence in escaping. Not everyone possessed a Yin Escape Talisman like Xinxiang's.</p><p>As for Holy Venerable Huiguang's promise, no one knew how credible it truly was, but they could only comfort themselves with it.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang likely made the promise publicly, rather than through sound transmission, to appease the crowd. With so many cultivators outside the mountain as witnesses, and needing to maintain the Buddhist Sect's reputation, he likely wouldn't go back on his word easily.</p><p>Old Devil Fan remained by Holy Venerable Huiguang's side, knowing that the latter wouldn't let him go easily, and hadn't considered leaving.</p><p>Yue Lingtian's expression flickered with uncertainty. He regretted not being content with obtaining the Earth Phase inheritance and instead joining in the fray. Helplessly, he bowed to the monk's illusory image and turned to ascend the mountain.</p><p>True Person Hegao meticulously collected True Person Zilei's remains and returned to the summit as instructed, remaining silent throughout. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>They all hailed from renowned sects, holding positions of Sect Master or Grand Elder, with esteemed statuses and considerable prestige in the cultivation world. Even facing two Soul Formation experts, they didn't lose their composure.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar and Mo Xingdao's backgrounds were far less impressive.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only an avatar. As long as his true body remained unharmed, Qin Sang's essence wouldn't be injured.</p><p>The avatar's expression was calm, flying towards the summit unhurriedly.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was likely the most conflicted and uneasy. His only solace was the puppet hidden in the shadows. If any unforeseen circumstances arose later, he might have a chance to escape.</p><p>If things went south, he could command the puppet to flee with the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, which would at least serve as a bargaining chip.</p><p>Mo Xingdao composed himself and turned back to the mountain.</p><p>Soon, almost all the cultivators on Emperor Bestowment Mountain gathered at the summit.</p><p>True Person Hegao, Old Devil Fan, Yue Lingtian, Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang's avatar, along with Qin Sang's true body hidden within the stone house, the Poison King whose fate was unknown, Grandmaster Huaiyin who was healing outside the mountain, and Su Zinan whose whereabouts were unknown. Of the top experts who had entered the Formless Immortal Sect, only these few remained.</p><p>They exchanged glances, all speechless. The previous scheming and infighting now seemed like a joke.</p><p>"Silently circulate this 'Calming Mantra' for three cycles. If you perceive any anomaly, immediately lock down your mind. Do not harbor any侥幸!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang sent out a streak of light, conjuring bright characters that floated in mid-air, radiating shimmering starlight.</p><p>Everyone looked towards the sound and saw a rather profound arcane art. The name of this arcane art was quite ordinary, and its cultivation wasn't difficult.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang didn't explain the origins of the Calming Mantra.</p><p>This arcane art was actually passed down from the Formless Immortal Sect, created by its experts to counter demonic corruption during the Demonic Tribulation.</p><p>Cultivators who had recently been corrupted could activate the Calming Mantra and, with a high probability, discover their own abnormalities and address them in time. The higher the cultivator's cultivation, the better the effect.</p><p>It was the emergence of this arcane art that brought a turning point in the war, eventually containing the Demonic Tribulation within the two southern barbarian states.</p><p>Of course, the Calming Mantra wasn't foolproof. It was said that demonic corruption also varied in strength. If the demon who planted the demonic seed possessed profound demonic power and used powerful arcane arts, meticulously planning and slowly scheming, concealing it deeply, the chances of discovery were very low.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect experts had placed too much trust in the Calming Mantra, only realizing the problem later and being forced to seal themselves.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang had already learned the general course of events from Old Devil Fan. Since the Devil Child had just broken free from the seal and was deeply affected by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, it should have had no opportunity or ability to perform such deep corruption.</p><p>Those on the mountain were all top experts. The firmer their minds, the stronger their resistance to demonic corruption.</p><p>The Calming Mantra was sufficient.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang's action was a precautionary measure to prevent these people from causing chaos during the upcoming battle.</p><p>Everyone had some understanding of the Demonic Tribulation and the dangers of demonic corruption. They readily followed his instructions, silently circulating the Calming Mantra, including others who saw the mantra.</p><p>While imparting the Calming Mantra, Holy Venerable Huiguang's stern voice once again resounded throughout Emperor Bestowment Mountain and beyond.</p><p>"I give you three days to leave the Central Plains. Never step foot into the Central Plains again!"</p><p>In a hidden location.</p><p>Su Zinan concealed himself here with an escape talisman, looking up at the summit with a slightly pale face.</p><p>In a short time, two overwhelmingly powerful divine senses had swept over him dozens of times. If not for the protection of the escape talisman, he would have already been dragged out.</p><p>Su Zinan knew full well that Holy Venerable Huiguang's warning was largely directed at him. Although there were no explicit threats, the chilling killing intent in his tone made his heart tighten.</p><p>He scoffed inwardly, but ultimately dared not act rashly.</p><p>At this moment, Holy Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu's attention was primarily on the demonic body.</p><p>Within the mountain's belly, various strange lights flickered.</p><p>The light of the Five-Colored Crown became increasingly dazzling, completely concealing the demonic body within its five-colored spiritual light. The gray cocoon formed by the Poison King was also almost swallowed by the five-colored spiritual light.</p><p>Only the outline of the cocoon could be seen within the five-colored spiritual light, a huge protrusion.</p><p>No one knew how much longer the cocoon could hold out.</p><p>With Holy King Qinghu's assistance, Holy Venerable Huiguang could finally spare some attention, slightly shifting the Dharmachakra of True Law towards the cocoon.</p><p>Silver rings coiled around the cocoon, not to restrain it, but to help the Poison King resist the five-colored spiritual light.</p><p>The Poison King inside the cocoon seemed to have sensed the fluctuations of the Dharmachakra of True Law. The cocoon pulsed, resonating with the silver rings, jointly resisting the devil, temporarily free from the worry of rupturing, but that was all.</p><p>Unable to rescue the Poison King for the time being, Holy Venerable Huiguang knew he couldn't be hasty and focused on dealing with the demonic body first.</p><p>He didn't realize that this action had effectively extinguished the Devil Spirit's last hope, prompting it to take the most drastic measures.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu appeared to the left of Holy Venerable Huiguang, flicking her jade fingers repeatedly. Thunderous waves echoed within the mountain's belly, as if an ocean was being poured inside, triggering a terrifying storm.</p><p>She gazed downwards, her eyes gradually turning white.</p><p>This was pure white, without pupils. Her eerie gaze pierced through the chaos.</p><p>"Something seems amiss."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu furrowed her brows slightly, her voice solemn.</p><p>She already knew what had transpired and had some speculations about the demonic body's origins and state. The demonic body could clearly control the Five-Colored Crown now. If the Artifact Spirit had already been subdued by the Ancient Devil, they weren't just facing an Ancient Devil, they were in serious trouble!</p><p>No wonder Holy Venerable Huiguang was distracted by so many things, using both coercion and inducement to forcibly keep these Nascent Soul cultivators here.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang considered all possible variables, dividing his attention, and also preventing the demonic body from escaping. In such a short time, the drain on his mental energy was terrifying.</p><p>His breath slightly steadied, and Holy Venerable Huiguang was about to speak.</p><p>A sudden change occurred within the mountain's belly!</p><p>Within the demonic body, Zhu Wudao and the Devil Child had fused into a Devil Soul, which was now forcibly devoured by the Devil Spirit. This was equivalent to the Devil Spirit devouring both of them whole.</p><p>Although they had both lost the ability to resist, the crucial point was that the devouring occurred amidst the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>A shrill roar suddenly erupted from within the mountain's belly, piercingly sharp, like steel needles piercing the eardrums of Old Devil Fan and the others. Their minds seemed to be pierced as well, feeling a sharp pain.</p><p>Everyone was startled out of their meditative state, looking towards the mountain's belly in horror, while simultaneously hearing Holy King Qinghu's warning: "Be careful!"</p><p>Before her voice faded.</p><p>A five-colored beam of light suddenly shot out from within the mountain's belly, like a sharp sword, streaking across the sky like a rainbow. Sensing the beam's terrifying destructive aura, everyone's expressions changed drastically.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...'</p><p>Everyone soared into the air.</p><p>The next moment, the cultivators outside the mountain heard a thunderous explosion, and saw the summit of Emperor Bestowment Mountain explode, sending rubble flying. The entire Immortal Abode trembled violently.</p><p>What erupted from the crater wasn't magma, but an endless torrent of water, like an inverted waterfall.</p><p>A beautiful rainbow erupted along with the water.</p><p>This scene held no beauty whatsoever. Everyone could sense the terrifying demonic energy. Even those who weren't near Emperor Bestowment Mountain couldn't help but tremble.</p><p>At the edge of the Gold Phase Hall.</p><p>The old nun's emotions were a rollercoaster. First, she witnessed True Person Zilei's tribulation failure. Before she could breathe a sigh of relief, Soul Formation cultivators appeared one after another, shocking her greatly.</p><p>The Hidden Moon Convent nuns were still exploring the Gold Phase Hall, and it wasn't easy to withdraw quickly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, demonic energy surged again, and the situation changed drastically.</p><p>The old nun didn't know whether the current situation was good or bad, but at least the two Soul Formation cultivators were entangled, buying them some time.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Bai Xiao was leading the demons towards them. Seeing the scene on Emperor Bestowment Mountain from afar, he was shocked, but the Holy King had given orders, so he could only brace himself and continue, albeit subtly slowing down to observe the situation first.</p><p>No one outside the mountain could feel as clearly as Old Devil Fan and the others.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's jade had melted, and vast waves formed a massive vortex in the sky. When they saw the scene within the vortex, they all gasped.</p><p>A figure, wearing the Five Elements Crown, hovered in mid-air.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this was Zhu Wudao's transformed demonic body.</p><p>However, it was difficult to describe the current demonic body with the word 'human'.</p><p>More accurately, it was just a mass of flesh maintaining a humanoid shape.</p><p>The skin on the demonic body was cracked and bulging everywhere, covered in tumors. These tumors then burst, revealing blood and gore, flesh curling outwards. In some places, even bone fragments could be seen, a truly repulsive sight.</p><p>The demonic body could only barely maintain its humanoid form. Its facial features were shifted, more like large tumors, barely discernible as a face, filled with pain and madness.</p><p>It was unimaginable what Zhu Wudao had endured to become like this.</p><p>Everyone stared at this scene, their hearts turning cold.</p><p>Was this an Ancient Devil?</p><p>Was this the end result of demonic corruption?</p><p>Thousands of times more terrifying than described in any records.</p><p>Chills ran down their spines, filled with fear. If Holy Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu hadn't arrived in time, they would have caused a great disaster today.  Whether they could have escaped unscathed was questionable.</p><p>"Old monk, I don't want to become such a monster!"</p><p>Holy King Qinghu said gravely.</p><p>From the demonic body, she seemed to see her own future.</p><p>Assimilated by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, it seemed it wasn't just a matter of going insane, but it would eventually manifest in one's outward appearance. True Person Zilei's mind had collapsed and he perished before the Heart Demon Tribulation ended. Otherwise, given more time, he would have also become an indescribable mass of flesh and blood.</p><p>The Devil Spirit had underestimated the power of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound. Once the devouring began, it couldn't be stopped. As the devouring continued, the demonic body and the Five Elements Crown became increasingly attuned, its power growing. However, during the process, its resistance to the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound weakened, its consciousness gradually consumed by madness.</p><p>Its true form, the Five Elements Crown, still existed, but it couldn't stop its descent into the abyss. The deeper the fusion, the deeper the influence of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, almost completely losing its sentience.</p><p>However, during this process, it became free from restraints and inhibitions. The inherent madness drove it to destroy and wreak havoc on everything in sight.</p><p>The current Devil Spirit's state was becoming increasingly similar to the ferocious beasts within the Storm Belt.</p><p>They were about to have a preview of their beast hunt.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu keenly sensed the changes in the demonic body and repeated, "I don't want to become such a monster!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang understood the meaning behind her words.</p><p>They had to divide their attention to resist the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, unable to unleash their true power. With his injuries unhealed, he could only rely on Holy King Qinghu to go all out to confront the Ancient Devil.</p><p>But if Holy King Qinghu consumed too much energy, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound would exploit the opportunity, and she would follow in the Devil Child's footsteps.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu wasn't like him, still concerned about his sect.</p><p>If the situation became hopeless, Holy King Qinghu would definitely withdraw and focus on finding a way to ascend.</p><p>Preoccupied with her own survival, what did the rise and fall of the world, the lives of mortals, have to do with her?</p><p>Moreover, the first to suffer would be the human race.</p><p>"We can choose not to eliminate this devil, but doesn't the Holy King want to extract something from the Ancient Devil? This poor monk suspects that the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound might be related to the Demon Monarch sealed within the Immortal Palace. Now that the Immortal Palace has ascended, there's only one who knows the truth in this realm, and that's him!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang communicated with Holy King Qinghu through sound transmission. "Although I don't know why the Ancient Devil couldn't resist the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound either. If we can capture it alive and learn the reason for the Heavenly Dao's transformation, we can have a clear target when searching for a solution."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu naturally understood these principles, but the impact of the demonic body was too great.</p><p>"Form the Dhyana Arhat Formation!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang shouted in a low voice, simultaneously sending out several beams of golden light towards everyone.</p><p>Everyone received the golden light, their minds reflecting a Buddhist formation.</p><p>The Dhyana Arhat Formation was a type of Buddhist battle formation.</p><p>The Sweet Dew Chan Monastery possessed a complete Vajra Subduing Demon Formation, perfectly suited for dealing with Ancient Devils.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn't here.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu had previously discussed hunting ferocious beasts in the Storm Belt, requiring the combined efforts of the Holy King's Palace Immortal Formation and the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation. Holy Venerable Huiguang had instructed Grandmaster Xingji to contact the top experts of various Buddhist sects to divide the formation's core, the Vajra Pearl, and send it to them for comprehension, preparing for the hunt.</p><p>At this time, Grandmaster Xingji and the others were still on their way, and several others were in secluded cultivation at their respective sects. They were clearly too late.</p><p>Who would have thought that there would be an opportunity to use the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation here?</p><p>Before the beast hunt even began, they were faced with an Ancient Devil.</p><p>Of course, even if Holy Venerable Huiguang had brought the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation, it would be difficult to utilize. Comprehending spiritual formations required time, and these individuals weren't Buddhist disciples. No matter how high their cultivation, they couldn't master it instantly.</p><p>Battle formations were much simpler, requiring only obedience to Holy Venerable Huiguang's commands.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Everyone's figures flickered, and the formation was instantly formed.</p><p>Without any effort on their part, a certain power emanated from Holy Venerable Huiguang. A halo appeared behind everyone's head, resembling Dharma protectors from murals, their appearances solemn and dignified.</p><p>With the formation complete, everyone's morale soared.</p><p>However, looking at the demonic body, everyone was calculating inwardly. The two Soul Formation experts didn't seem to intend to go all out.  Were they expected to deal with such a terrifying devil?</p><p>How many would ultimately survive?</p>
