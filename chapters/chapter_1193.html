<h1>Chapter 1185: The Turn</h1><p>The Yuejin Mirror blazed intensely.</p><p>Endless golden light cascaded down like a waterfall, suppressing the Fire Rope!</p><p>The Fire Rope, refusing to yield, fought back fiercely.</p><p>For a moment, the heavens and earth changed color.</p><p>Above the void, water and fire mingled.  The two magical artifacts combined their powers; the Fire Rope, receiving a constant influx of energy, charged madly against the golden light, even pushing it back.</p><p>Si Di, exerting all his strength to control the Yuejin Mirror, was still unable to withstand the combined attack of the two artifacts. Seeing the Yuejin Mirror faltering, he grew anxious, quickly patting his waist to summon other treasures.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A figure silently appeared.</p><p>It was Chan Ling, who had been hiding for a long time!</p><p>Seizing the opportune moment, when the battle raged at its height, Chan Ling emerged from his concealing veil, appearing behind Si Di.</p><p>His posture was peculiar.</p><p>Instead of standing, he sat cross-legged in the void, one hand holding a jade bottle, the other hand outstretched, five fingers extended towards the unsuspecting Si Di.</p><p>The jade bottle was already open, containing a black venom—odorless and without any other unusual phenomena, yet radiating an immensely sinister aura.</p><p>His other hand was even more eerie, bearing a spider tattoo on the back.</p><p>The spider looked lifelike, as if a real spider were clinging to his hand.</p><p>Retracting his veil,</p><p>The spider tattoo on Chan Ling's hand glowed black, transforming into a black spider. His fingers moved like the spider's legs, the spider's appearance ferocious and clearly malevolent.</p><p>Ordinary people would feel a chill run down their spines at the sight of such an evil spider.</p><p>Simultaneously with the appearance of the evil spider, Chan Ling gently shook his other hand, sending the venom from the jade bottle shooting into the spider like an arrow.</p><p>The evil spider absorbed all the venom. It became even more sinister, emitting a terrifying wail, a low, demonic sound that seemed to pierce directly into one's mind.</p><p>Two rows of evil eyes, radiating malice and greed, stared fixedly at Si Di's back.</p><p>The instant Chan Ling appeared,</p><p>Tan Laomo roared, "Attack!"</p><p>The three Nether Towers vibrated violently. Pei Laomo, who had been closely monitoring the battle, immediately acted according to their prearranged plan, activating the Nether Towers for support.</p><p>The crystal ball, black as ink, shot out three enormous beams of light, which vanished into the cold mist formation.</p><p>These beams were not aimed at Si Di, but converged in mid-air, transforming into a dark shroud that appeared above the battlefield where Si Di and the others were fighting, descending upon them!</p><p>At this moment, the icy wind and snow were blocked by the shroud.</p><p>This was to counter the power of the Ice Bell array, preventing anyone controlling it from rescuing Si Di and disrupting the hunt.</p><p>With the Nether Towers isolating the array,</p><p>Si Di would be completely alone!</p><p>However, the Nether Towers did more than that. Pei Laomo aimed them directly at Si Di. The shroud exerted a powerful pressure and constraint, suppressing Si Di.</p><p>The three Yuan Ying cultivators collaborated flawlessly.</p><p>Simultaneously with Chan Ling's appearance and the descent of the shroud, Tan Laomo suddenly reversed his palm and pressed it against the triangular flag.</p><p>Immediately, the two artifacts reversed roles: the Fire Rope suddenly dimmed, while the triangular flag's power surged.</p><p>Until now, Tan Laomo had always used the Fire Rope as the primary weapon, with the triangular flag as a secondary one.</p><p>Now, it was capable of being used in reverse, with the triangular flag as the main attack.</p><p>This was the true essence of water and fire complementing each other!</p><p>With the opponent focused on countering the Fire Rope, this surprise attack was very likely to succeed.</p><p>Si Di was precisely in such a situation.</p><p>Waves converged into a great river, flowing upstream, surging up towards Si Di's legs—a cunning move.</p><p>Si Di, caught off guard, had no time to use the Yuejin Mirror to defend himself. He tried to dodge, only to find that the shroud above was already falling.</p><p>'Crack! Crack!'</p><p>The river froze, turning into an iceberg; the space around Si Di was sealed off. The Xuan water, sharp as blades, surged towards Si Di, joining the assault.</p><p>Two forces trapped Si Di between them.</p><p>However, neither of these were fatal blows. If Si Di reacted quickly and received support from the Ice Bell array, he still had a chance of escape.</p><p>The real killing blow was Chan Ling's.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Chan Ling uttered a single word.</p><p>The evil spider transformed into a black light, appearing behind Si Di in an instant.</p><p>The iceberg formed by the triangular flag failed to stop the evil spider, which then burrowed directly into Si Di's protective aura, meeting no resistance.</p><p>A sinister smile curved Chan Ling's lips. Other magical abilities suffered delays, but this recently perfected evil technique perfectly complemented his concealing veil.</p><p>The spider, transformed and fed on potent venom, was specifically designed to break through cultivators' protective auras. Even a powerful Yuan Ying cultivator, caught off guard, would be in grave danger if bitten by this spider.</p><p>At this moment, Si Di could not escape.  The three Yuan Ying cultivators all wore confident expressions.</p><p>However, they wanted to capture Si Di's Yuanying as well, so Old Master Pei and Old Master Tan stood fully prepared at the Hanling Array, preventing reinforcements.</p><p>The next moment, the evil spider bit Si Di.</p><p>What followed stunned all three Yuanying cultivators.</p><p>The evil spider made a "crunch" sound, a clash of metal, accompanied by its pained shriek. Si Di’s figure flickered and vanished, replaced by the Yuejin Mirror!</p><p>Si Di's shadow appeared on the mirror's surface.</p><p>Somehow, Si Di had escaped the trap and appeared where the Yuejin Mirror had been.</p><p>In a moment of crisis, he had switched places with his treasure!</p><p>Chan Ling and the others were dumbfounded.  They watched helplessly as Si Di disappeared from their carefully laid trap, unable to comprehend how he'd done it.</p><p>Si Di’s face was flushed, his breath ragged, his expression full of mockery.</p><p>He was unharmed; the Yuejin Mirror had taken the blow for him.</p><p>Chan Ling and Old Master Tan were seasoned cultivators.  Their failed ambush didn't deter them; they immediately prepared to continue the hunt.</p><p>Si Di's condition showed the escape technique had been extremely taxing, but they still had a chance!</p><p>Just as this thought crossed their minds, a thunderous roar echoed from outside the array, followed by Old Master Pei’s furious yell.</p><p>The two cultivators' faces finally changed!</p><p>Two figures, clearly Yuanying-level masters, appeared at the edge of the Youjing Tower outside the array.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Tan Laomao, seeing Si Di's mocking expression, suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder it had been so easy; while they were attacking Si Di, the Hanling Array hadn't counterattacked as expected, because it wasn't a Yuanying cultivator controlling it!</p><p>They thought they had been foolproof.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, they were being played!</p><p>Chan Ling's face was even grimmer. Countless thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>It was unclear whether this had been a trap to lure Pei and Tan, and he'd simply stumbled upon it, or if he'd been exposed and they'd turned the tables.</p><p>If he had been discovered, Chan Ling's concerns extended far beyond this battle's outcome.</p><p>Chan Ling could almost act with impunity on the battlefield as long as he didn't face Zhenyi Laodao and the others—that was the advantage of the Wu Guang Sha. But these three newcomers weren't among them.</p><p>Had the Two Regions Alliance devised a counter to the Wu Guang Sha?</p><p>"Save him!"</p><p>Chan Ling barked the order.</p>
