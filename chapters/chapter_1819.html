<h1>Chapter 1810: Field of Corpses</h1><p>This spiritual tree resembled the foundation of the entire palace.  With the spiritual tree removed, the palace immediately began to collapse.</p><p>Only at this moment did the three realize that the entire palace was an illusion!</p><p>Qin Sang shouted almost the instant the palace began to crumble, but it was too late.</p><p>The collapse started in the main hall, the ripples emanating from the hall's entrance spreading like waves on the surface of water.</p><p>Thunder crackled across Qin Sang's back, but before he could summon his Azure Phoenix Wings, the ripples reached him, carrying a strange power that engulfed him.</p><p>The same scene played out in the other main hall. At this critical juncture, Realist Boxian was also aghast. With a flick of his wrist, the golden ring he wore emitted a resonant clang.</p><p>A jade ring on Exquisite Monarch Qingdan's wrist also chimed crisply.</p><p>Golden and jade light radiated from the two treasures, which seemed to be connected. The lights resonated with each other, and a slender thread appeared between them, linking the two.</p><p>Exquisite Monarch Qingdan, now realizing something was amiss, felt the jade ring on her wrist vibrate violently.</p><p>The thread snapped taut, and Realist Boxian was dragged by an immense force, forcibly pulling him out of the ripples.  Still shaken and with unconcealed panic in his eyes, he watched helplessly as Qin Sang was swallowed by the ripples on the other side.</p><p>But their situation wasn't much better than Qin Sang's. This was the collapse of the entire palace, not just the main hall. The ripples were everywhere, spreading out from all directions.</p><p>In the last moment, Qin Sang saw the two rapidly retreating figures surrounded by the ripples, forced into a desperate situation.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A deafening roar of wind whistled in his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a helpless bird caught in a hurricane.  Hastily, he deployed treasures and divine abilities to protect himself.  At the same time, he flapped his Phoenix Wings fiercely, lightning flashing repeatedly as he barely managed to stabilize himself, but he was still swept towards the ground.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A crisp sound came from beneath his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang found that he had landed on solid ground.</p><p>"That sound wasn't right…"</p><p>With the situation unclear, Qin Sang didn't rashly extend his divine sense, but the Skyeye Butterfly timely transmitted its thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression immediately changed.</p><p>Beneath his feet lay a skeleton. The sound came from its ribs, which he had just broken.  The bones were decayed and instantly crumbled into fragments beneath his weight.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, there wasn't just one skeleton.</p><p>Within his and the Skyeye Butterfly's field of vision, the ground was covered in pale white bones.</p><p>The bones were piled layer upon layer, countless and unfathomably deep, leaving no gaps between them.</p><p>Even in the dim light, these bones were blindingly white, sending chills down one's spine.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of horrific massacre had taken place here.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed that the bones weren't just human; there were various animal bones as well. However, within the area he could see, human bones accounted for more than half.</p><p>"A battlefield between humans and demons?"</p><p>Recalling various rumors about the Ju Mountain Altar, a speculation arose in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Another possibility was that, like the palace, everything before his eyes was another undetectable illusion.</p><p>Flowers and grasses grew among the piles of bones.</p><p>The flora flourished, exceptionally vigorous, as if the soil formed by the accumulated bones was incredibly fertile, providing them with ample nourishment.</p><p>Each plant was as thick as a large tree.  Standing on the ground, Qin Sang could see the roots and leaves of the plants and felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Thinking of a possibility, Qin Sang's heart tightened. He flew upwards, and when he passed through the leaves and reached the top, he was met with a horrifying scene.</p><p>Bones littered the ground.</p><p>Spiritual flowers grew among the bones, blooming brilliantly.  Their rich fragrance carried a strange sweetness, incredibly potent, filling the entire area.</p><p>This scene immediately reminded Qin Sang of the flower field he had seen through the swirling mist.</p><p>The flower field within the mist was definitely related to this place, except that what they had thought was soil was actually bone.</p><p>In addition, the spiritual flowers here were more sparsely distributed.  One area of bones could only support one flower, unlike the dense flower field within the mist. However, the flowers here were much larger than those within the mist.</p><p>It was as if a section of this bone flower field had been projected into the mist, inevitably distorted and different from the real thing.</p><p>The subsequent changes confirmed Qin Sang's guess.</p><p>The spiritual flowers swayed continuously, spraying pollen and silken threads from their stamens.  Cocoons began to float in the air above the bone flower field.</p><p>The cocoons were light and slightly larger than a normal person.</p><p>Then, a series of bizarre scenes replayed before Qin Sang.  The cocoons split open, and flower spirits sat up inside, hugging their knees.</p><p>The flower spirits, both male and female, were beautiful. They wore only light gauze that seemed woven from pollen.  Their figures were graceful, their demeanor natural, like celestial maidens.</p><p>However, these flower spirits weren't gazing at the sky, nor were they dancing. Instead, they all stared at Qin Sang, the only anomaly in the bone flower field!</p><p>No matter how far away, no matter the direction, all the flower spirits focused on Qin Sang, rigidly turning their heads, some even twisting their bodies grotesquely.</p><p>Their eyes were empty, their faces expressionless, devoid of joy or sorrow.</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp tingled. He sensed deep resentment in the flower spirits' empty eyes.</p><p>Of course, flower spirits that grew by devouring bones and corpse Qi couldn't be without resentment.</p><p>Flower spirits born in such a place were bound to be evil spirits!</p><p>Gradually, the resentment in the flower spirits' eyes intensified.  The overwhelming resentment converged on Qin Sang, bringing a bone-chilling coldness.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Even when separated by the mist, Qin Sang had been extremely wary of the flower spirits.  Now, trapped in the flower field, his mind was even more tense.</p><p>He quickly scanned his surroundings but didn't find Exquisite Monarch Qingdan or Realist Boxian.</p><p>At the edge of the bone flower field, mountain shadows appeared in the distance.  This seemed to be a valley between mountains.</p><p>Beyond the mountains, there seemed to be a vast space.  Considering the swirling mists, this bone flower field might not be the only one.</p><p>If Exquisite Monarch Qingdan and Realist Boxian had held on a little longer, they might have landed elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang had also suspected that Exquisite Monarch Qingdan and Realist Boxian had set a trap to frame him, but their final panicked expressions didn't seem feigned.  Besides, he had no grievances with them and had even saved Exquisite Monarch Qingdan's disciple. What benefit would they gain from framing him?</p><p>The two had concealed the function of their treasure rings, which Qin Sang considered normal.  He himself had concealed many secrets and couldn't be completely unguarded against outsiders.</p><p>The truth was unclear, and he couldn't draw conclusions yet.  The most urgent matter was to escape this dangerous situation quickly.</p><p>The dense floral fragrance contained a strange poison, and surrounded by it, there was nowhere to hide.</p><p>The fragrance continuously assaulted him.  If he couldn't leave in time and was trapped for too long, reaching the limit of his poison beads, Qin Sang's situation would become extremely dangerous.</p><p>"How many of these bones belong to cultivators who accidentally stumbled in here?"</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang noticed the flower spirits' expressions change strangely.</p><p>Immediately afterward, pollen of various colors danced in the air above the flower field, flowing towards him.</p><p>Soon, the pollen gathered into a human shape, forming a giant, nearly thirty-foot-tall pollen figure. The pollen abruptly contracted, finally transforming into a graceful woman.</p><p>The woman was holy and pure, her skin like congealed fat, resembling a flower fairy.  Her gentle gaze fell upon Qin Sang, devoid of the resentment of the other flower spirits.  Her eyes seemed to hold a tender affection.</p><p>After the flower fairy appeared, the gazes of the other flower spirits also softened, suppressing their resentment.</p><p>"You've come."</p><p>The flower fairy's eyes lit up with joy, her voice like celestial music, intoxicating.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>"You've finally come to accompany me. Do you know how lonely I am here?" The flower fairy's eyes turned mournful, yet still full of affection. She extended a jade hand and murmured softly, "Sleepless nights, longing for intimacy…"</p><p>At this moment, the flower fairy resembled a celestial maiden waiting for her beloved's return.  The intensity of the affection in her beautiful eyes made one's heart tremble.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He couldn't let a person of unknown origin approach him.  He instinctively stepped back, about to speak.</p><p>Unexpectedly, seeing Qin Sang's retreating movement, the flower fairy's expression instantly changed, becoming incredibly狰狞, and she let out a piercing scream, "You dare despise me!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond,</p><p>The flower fairy had already descended into madness.  Her ten fingers clawed at her flawless face, instantly leaving ten bloody marks, tearing off a layer of skin.</p><p>Then, the flower fairy's body swelled, shedding her beautiful appearance.  She transformed into a malevolent ghost with a swollen yellow face, a gaping maw, inch-long teeth, and a bluish-green tongue.</p><p>The evil ghost glared at Qin Sang, its rage shaking the heavens.</p><p>Along with the evil ghost's shriek, the previously quiet flower spirits erupted once more with overwhelming resentment, tears of blood streaming from their eyes.</p><p>In an instant, the flower field transformed into a ghostly realm.</p><p>"Evil spirits indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang showed no fear. He snorted coldly, and with a flap of his thunder wings, he transformed into a streak of lightning and soared into the sky.</p><p>Unleashing his Thunder Escape technique without reservation, Qin Sang's speed was astonishing.</p><p>A bolt of lightning streaked across the void.</p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how fast Qin Sang's escape, he couldn't shake off the evil ghost. Pollen was everywhere in this place, and the evil ghost instantly appeared in front of him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a fierce aura rush towards him as the ghostly figure pounced.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn't gain an advantage through speed, Qin Sang abruptly stopped his escape, shifting sideways several yards, and a sword light flew out from his sleeve.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword trembled, splitting into a beam of sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy, like lightning, slashed fiercely towards the evil ghost.</p><p>The evil ghost showed no intention of dodging. It extended a ghostly hand, catching the sword energy head-on.</p><p>'Puff!'</p><p>The sword light pierced the ghostly hand, leaving a shocking wound, but the wound instantly healed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew solemn.  The evil ghost's strength was even greater than he had anticipated.</p><p>To make matters worse, the entire flower field of flower spirits was now alerted.  Carried by pollen, they floated towards Qin Sang with ethereal grace.</p><p>Tears of blood streamed down the flower spirits' faces, a tragic beauty mixed with deep resentment. The resentment fused with the flower poison, surging towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the change in the flower poison, his expression growing increasingly grave.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>An evil wind rushed at his face.</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow, neither dodging nor flinching.  His fist shot out like a dragon, imbued with the power of the Demon Subduing Seal.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A ghostly hand appeared before Qin Sang, precisely intercepted by his heavy fist.</p><p>The spikes on his gauntlets sank entirely into the ghostly hand, a strange bloody glow flowing along the spikes, surging into the evil ghost's body.</p><p>Whether the evil ghost truly felt pain or not, it shrieked, its ferocity amplified.</p><p>At this moment, a sword cry echoed from above.</p><p>The sky darkened, and the constellations aligned.</p><p>The Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation reappeared, enveloping not only the evil ghost but also a large area of the flower field and its spirits.</p><p>Buddhist seals appeared one after another.</p><p>Qin Sang advanced instead of retreating, actively charging towards the evil ghost.</p><p>At the same time, the sword stars flickered continuously, radiating sharp sword energy. However, the targets of the sword energy weren't the evil ghost, but the flower spirits.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…'</p><p>Sword energy pierced the air like tragic meteors in the starry sky.</p><p>The flower spirits sensed the danger, their bleeding eyes fixed on the incoming sword energy. They shrieked, and the resentment fused with the flower poison materialized, forming a barrier between them and the sword energy.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were separated by the sword formation, unable to form a cohesive defense, and were continuously cut down.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was entangled with the evil ghost, most of his attention was focused on the flower spirits.  He noticed that every time a flower spirit was killed, a spiritual flower withered.</p><p>But immediately, new sprouts emerged from the withered spots, growing into new spiritual flowers.</p><p>This place was similar to the jungle. The flower spirits were endless, but Qin Sang couldn't sense even a trace of wood spirit energy.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang's gaze landed on the evil ghost.</p><p>This place was too strange, and he didn't know what lay beyond the bone flower field.</p><p>The flower spirits had no intelligence. The evil ghost was the only one he could communicate with. It would be best to capture it alive and inquire about the origin and exit of this place.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang's attacks became even more ferocious.</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaining flower spirits were also excluded from the sword formation, the sword stars hanging above him and the evil ghost.</p><p>Now, all seven stellar regions manifested within the sword formation, locking onto the evil ghost.</p><p>Against other opponents, Qin Sang might have held back, fearing they would see through his techniques. However, the evil ghost was driven mad, intent on devouring Qin Sang's flesh and blood, completely disregarding the sword formation.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang evaded the evil ghost's attack like a phantom, passing under its armpit and circling behind it, striking its back with a fierce blow.</p><p>This strike combined the Auspicious, Rotating Altar, and Demon Subduing Seals, its power extraordinary.</p><p>'Puff!'</p><p>Struck heavily, the evil ghost lurched forward, nearly falling.</p><p>In that instant, sword energy rained down, instantly engulfing the evil ghost.</p><p>The evil ghost howled, its body covered in wounds, as it charged out of the sword rain, but Qin Sang was already waiting for it.</p><p>With layers of defense, the evil ghost couldn't truly injure Qin Sang's body, but there was one exception.</p><p>As they fought, the surrounding flower poison grew increasingly dense, and each of the evil ghost's attacks carried a potent poison, placing immense pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>"I can't prolong this fight!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, and a fierce glint flashed in his eyes. His figure shifted, appearing directly in front of the evil ghost, his attacks bordering on frenzied.</p><p>Above in the sky, the sword stars radiated brilliantly.  Suddenly, the stars shifted, and all seven stellar regions moved.</p><p>Starlight converged, sword intent pouring down.</p><p>This starlight was awe-inspiring, far exceeding its previous power.  Midway, the starlight twisted, transforming into a white tiger that descended from the sky.</p><p>The white tiger's ferocity was unparalleled, like a celestial beast descending, gathering the power of the stars, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>White Tiger's Malevolent Aura!</p><p>The seven western constellations were also known as the White Tiger.</p><p>This was the true killing move of the Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation, only attainable through complete comprehension of the sword formation.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had unleashed the White Tiger's Malevolent Aura, and he didn't know its true power.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The tiger's roar shook the world.</p><p>Before the malevolent aura reached it, the evil ghost seemed to be startled by the roar, its body stiffening, fear appearing in its eyes.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang's attack continued relentlessly.  His fist slammed into the evil ghost's chest, sending it flying. Then, he suddenly noticed a strange change in the evil ghost's expression.</p><p>Self-destruction?</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly.  He hadn't anticipated such ferocity from the evil ghost.  Completely abandoning the idea of capturing it alive, he withdrew his fist and stood firm, focusing all his attention on controlling the White Tiger's Malevolent Aura.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The white tiger descended from the sky, landing upon the evil ghost, passing straight through its body.</p><p>On the verge of self-destruction, the evil ghost's aura was chaotic, but in this instant, it abruptly froze.</p><p>The next moment, its flesh and skin turned to ash, bit by bit.</p>
