<h1>Chapter 1269: Fall</h1><p>Chapter 1269: Fall</p><p>Qin Sang intentionally shattered his mask.  Dongyang Bo already knew his identity, so there was no need to hide it any longer.  Using Ye Laomo's blood demon avatar as a sacrifice was the perfect opportunity!</p><p>The blood demon avatar self-destructed, impacting the magic banner.  Without time to reorganize the magic banner formation, Qin Sang swept up all the banners, extinguished the demonic flames, and urged his sword towards Qing Jun to help against Ye Laomo.  Then he heard Qingluan cry out, and his heart leaped.</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously with the blood demon avatar's self-destruction…</p><p>Qingluan and Ye Laomo's icy hand grabbed for the jade bone almost at the same time.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sound of the avatar's explosion masked their clash.  Qingluan had just grasped one arm of the jade bone when a terrifying chill spread, instantly freezing its body from its talons.  A tremendous force arrived at the same time.</p><p>In the bloody sky…</p><p>A single azure feather, clear as a mountain stream, encased in ice, made the already ethereal Qingluan appear even more divine.  Like a fallen celestial phoenix, its long tail feathers trailed ice shards like starlight, scattering like rain.</p><p>Qingluan let out a mournful cry, its final song as clear and piercing as a phoenix’s call, yet heartbreaking in its clarity. It had striven to complete its master's command, but ultimately failed. Its two talons and half its body shattered with the ice, falling into the foul blood pool.</p><p>Ye Laomo's icy hand shattered, throwing Qingluan back.  Fragments of ice, enveloping the jade bone, flew back under the protection of the Yin and Yang halberds.</p><p>In the end, Ye Laomo was the stronger one!</p><p>Qing Jun’s body trembled violently; crimson blood flowed from his lips. The breathtaking landscape of mountains and rivers shattered, unable to be sustained.  The Qingluan puppet was severely wounded, and its master suffered backlash.</p><p>The Five-Element Pagoda and the Thunder Bead attempted to salvage the situation, but it was too late. The jade bone was carried away by the Yin and Yang halberds, beyond pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang, escaping the aftereffects of the blood demon avatar's explosion, witnessed this scene, watching helplessly as Ye Laomo carried the jade bone toward the blood pool's entrance.</p><p>"The ancient cultivator is dead!"</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to pursue, he heard Qing Jun's cold voice.</p><p>He saw the Five-Element Pagoda abandon the chase of Ye Laomo and suddenly speed towards another direction – the battlefield between Tianzheng and Tongyou.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, instantly understanding.</p><p>When the two realms' alliance decided to enter the Blood Lake, they had established a contingency plan.  Ye Laomo and Zu Yuan had been plotting for many years.  They themselves didn't even fully understand Zu Yuan's true objectives. Their reconnaissance efforts had been unsatisfactory, with their chances of disrupting Zu Yuan's plans being less than one in ten.</p><p>This was exactly what happened. Ye Laomo first set a trap, then used the Blood Gate and the Black Tower formation as obstacles, keeping them constantly busy.  If not for the unexpected variable of Jing Yu, by the time they deciphered the Black Tower formation and reached this location, Ye Laomo would have escaped with the jade bone.</p><p>The plan was to disrupt Zu Yuan's plot if possible; otherwise, to take the opportunity to kill Zu Yuan's Nascent Soul and weaken Zu Yuan's forces.</p><p>Later, they learned from Jing Yu that the Black Tower formation contained a living ancient cultivator, revealing Zu Yuan's plan. A living ancient cultivator was incredibly valuable, naturally piquing everyone's interest.  However, a dead ancient cultivator, aside from the jade bone's unique appearance, was little different from the corpses they’d encountered in past realms.</p><p>Qing Jun had confirmed that the jade bone was lifeless when he'd grasped it.  The ancient cultivator, desperately clinging to life, had refined his body in this manner, yet still couldn't escape his fate; he had been exhausted, completely dead, even before they entered.</p><p>That's why, even as they successively unsealed the blood pool, the cage, and the restraints on the jade bone, he remained unresponsive.  Over the years, numerous ancient cultivator corpses had been unearthed from the Ancient Immortal battlefield and the Ziwei Palace, including some, like the jade bone, that were unusual.  Experience proved it was difficult to obtain useful information from these remains.</p><p>The ancient cultivator was dead.  And with the jade bone in Ye Laomo's possession, reclaiming it would not be easy.</p><p>Qing Jun acted decisively, proceeding with the pre-arranged plan, shifting the target without warning; the Five-Element Pagoda changed course, smashing into Tianzheng.</p><p>Qin Sang understood and, glancing at Ye Laomo, immediately altered his sword’s trajectory.</p><p>Coincidentally, the self-destructing Blood Demon avatar blocked Tian Zheng's escape route, causing him to miss his best chance to retreat.</p><p>Tong You, alerted by Qing Jun, a seasoned veteran, quickly adapted his strategy. His magic seal unleashed a torrent of demonic wind, sealing off the starry river.</p><p>The situation changed in an instant.</p><p>Now, it was Tian Zheng desperately trying to escape, while Tong You relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>Amidst the starry river, Tian Zheng's face was filled with anger.  While he valued this Purple Palace traitor, he wasn't willing to sacrifice his own life. He stalled Tong You, buying time for Ye Lao Mo, while watching for an opportunity to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang's demonstrated power far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Anticipating trouble, Tian Zheng had prepared for a retreat.  Seeing Ye Lao Mo and Yu Gu emerge from the blood pool, he was about to act.</p><p>The Blood Demon avatar's self-destruction, forced by the demonic fire, was entirely unexpected.  Tian Zheng was caught off guard and suffered the consequences, missing his chance. However, he understood that in such a critical moment, the Blood Demon's self-destruction was unavoidable, and he didn't blame Ye Lao Mo.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Demonic energy surged from behind. He had already experienced the power of Tong You's magic seal.</p><p>Ahead, the Five Directions Pagoda clashed evenly with Ye Lao Mo's Yin-Yang Spear.</p><p>From the side, dazzling sword energy erupted with earth-shattering force.</p><p>If Qin Sang managed to deploy his sword array, even the Blood Demon avatar wouldn't easily break through.  And Qin Sang still possessed the terrifying demonic fire; once it recovered, Tian Zheng feared he'd meet the same fate as the avatar.</p><p>Surrounded on three sides, Tian Zheng was in dire straits!</p><p>Since their encounter, the situation had been volatile, yet everyone had maintained a degree of caution, avoiding putting themselves in mortal danger.</p><p>Unexpectedly, first the Blood Demon avatar self-destructed, then Tian Zheng was caught in the crossfire.</p><p>The situation was critical!</p><p>Though prepared to some extent, Tian Zheng's actions had taken a significant toll on him. Sighing inwardly, he realized he had no other choice.</p><p>The Star River Chart, manifesting as a starry river, was now mostly tainted by Tong You's demonic energy. The remaining starlight blazed, illuminating the heavens.</p><p>The starry river vanished, leaving behind a massive orb of light.</p><p>The orb, resembling a primordial egg, pulsed faintly.</p><p>A giant formed of starlight rose, merging with the stars, towering over the world.</p><p>From various distances, the Yin-Thunder Gourd, the magic seal, the Five Directions Pagoda, and the ebony sword arrived successively, followed by the Thunder Bead, all attacking the giant.</p><p>The giant, riddled with wounds and tottering, fought back relentlessly, desperately trying to break free.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous storm descended.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang unleashed his lightning techniques.</p><p>Heavenly thunder tore through the giant's body, but Tian Zheng, anticipating Qin Sang's attack, had prepared a defense. A green porcelain disc was revealed within the starlight giant's wound, deflecting the lightning.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>The battle at the blood pool entrance concluded.</p>
