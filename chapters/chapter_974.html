<h1>Chapter 966: Fall</h1><p>He moved a hundred zhang and landed in a patch of poisonous algae, his gaze fixed on a peculiar plant not far ahead.</p><p>This algae plant was unlike the others; its roots were red, and the seed pod at the top was larger than usual, more like a fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that what had captivated Fei Can was a poisonous algae.</p><p>But as Qin Sang attempted to approach the red algae, Fei Can suddenly issued a warning, spitting out strands of multicolored light.</p><p>Qin Sang then realized the red algae's danger; its toxicity far surpassed that of other algae.</p><p>His palm enveloped in the multicolored light, he dared to reach out and gently grasp the fruit.</p><p>A sizzling sound followed, the multicolored light strands visibly corroding. Fei Can hurriedly spat out more, finally managing to pick the fruit.</p><p>The fruit itself appeared ordinary, non-toxic.</p><p>Fortunately, Fei Can's cultivation had risen a level since their last visit, making the task less strenuous.</p><p>Putting away the fruit, Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings.</p><p>"Even Fei Can almost couldn't withstand the intense poison of the red algae. If I were to lure those demonic beasts here..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the demonic creatures without betraying his thoughts, but quickly dismissed the idea.</p><p>The red algae in this space were few and sparsely scattered, making it difficult to lure them, especially with Jiu Feng Wang present.</p><p>At this moment, Jiu Feng Wang had delved deep into the space.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang seemed to have opened another layer of restriction, and the sounds of howling wolves erupted from within.  Then, shadowy figures of ferocious wolves charged out, attacking Jiu Feng Wang.</p><p>The other demonic creatures showed apprehension, but then they witnessed Jiu Feng Wang's one-sided slaughter, the air quickly filling with a thick smell of blood.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the battle while moving towards another red algae plant.</p><p>Cai Yi Xianzi and the other demons, having ventured some distance into the space, were moving cautiously as the toxicity intensified.  Qin Sang's actions were conspicuous.</p><p>He harvested another fruit, pushed aside the algae, took a few quick steps, and arrived before a third red algae.  His movement froze.</p><p>A corpse lay on the ground.</p><p>The corpse's back was strangely familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, a premonition of ill omen washing over him.</p><p>"Old Man Zou!"</p><p>Turning the body over, seeing the aged yet familiar face, Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>He never imagined that this space was the place he and Old Man Zou had agreed to meet.</p><p>He wondered how Old Man Zou had found this place.</p><p>He had successfully entered, but met his death here.</p><p>It was clear that Old Man Zou hadn't known the true power of the red algae.</p><p>His antidotal preparations were insufficient.  Already struggling in this space, encountering the red algae proved instantly fatal.</p><p>Old Man Zou's face still held the surprise of discovering treasure; his unclosed eyes spoke of his unwillingness.</p><p>"It seems the one killed by Jiu Feng Wang was the helper Old Man Zou invited..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, sighing inwardly, feeling a profound sadness.</p><p>His relationship with Old Man Zou was a quiet, gentlemanly one, not like his bond with Yun Youzi, forged through shared life-or-death experiences.  However, their relationship was mutually beneficial, each getting what they needed.</p><p>After joining the merchant guild, Old Man Zou never pressured him to do anything, offering assistance instead. Qin Sang, on the other hand, often disappeared or went into seclusion. During his time on Wu Xing Island, it was mainly the Wang sisters who handled things.</p><p>He didn't know much about Old Man Zou's life.</p><p>It was said that Old Man Zou was once a prodigy, but had been stuck at a bottleneck for many years, unable to see any hope of breakthrough. Disheartened, he abandoned the path of immortality, entered the Demon Sea, and dedicated himself to the merchant guild.</p><p>Unexpectedly, fate played a cruel hand. The guild was just starting to thrive when the Demon Sea was thrown into chaos, destroying everything they had built.</p><p>This jolted Old Man Zou awake, realizing that everything else was merely illusion; only self-cultivation was fundamental.</p><p>But it was too late. His lifespan was dwindling, leaving him with only one desperate gamble: joining the Seven Killing Hall for a final fight.</p><p>Ultimatelyâ€¦he failed.</p><p>Hope appeared, but so did mortal danger.  Dawn was approaching, yet Old Man Zou fell at this very moment.  What a bitter end!</p><p>Reflecting on Old Man Zou's final years, Qin Sang felt a pang of sadness. But it was, undeniably, a true reflection of countless cultivators' lives.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue truly deserves to be a descendant of Bi Jiu. You can move freely in this place. What are you searching for? Is there something special about this algae compared to that outside?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu's voice came from behind.</p><p>"Come and see for yourself, Fellow Daoist Yuan."</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, his expression unchanged.</p><p>He gently brushed over Old Man Zou's eyes, closing them.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to give Old Man Zou a proper burial, perhaps even return his body home.</p><p>This action would inevitably arouse suspicion, so he removed Elder Zou's pouch and jade pendant from his chest, intending to return them to the merchant guild later if possible.</p><p>The pouch was almost empty, clearly indicating Elder Zou's resolve to die, leaving all his worldly possessions to his descendants before entering the Seven Killing Palace alone.</p><p>The jade pendant was an ordinary piece of earthly jade, yet it undoubtedly held special significance for Elder Zou.</p><p>Yuan Zhu walked over, exclaiming, "Another one dead here?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, flames erupting from his palm, instantly reducing the corpse to ashes to prevent Elder Zou's body from being dishonored.</p><p>"Huh? What's wrong with this poisonous algae...?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu noticed the anomaly in the red algae, his expression changing, quickly retreating and avoiding contact.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the silkworm's aura, seven-colored threads emerging from his sleeve to collect the fruits.</p><p>Yuan Zhu clicked his tongue in admiration, "Friend Daoist, what skillful methods! I wonder what use these fruits have? Do you know the origins of this red algae?"</p><p>"I don't know," Qin Sang shook his head, saying calmly, "This is my first time seeing this kind of algae.  I'm collecting some, hoping they might be useful."</p><p>Yuan Zhu followed Qin Sang, chattering incessantly as he collected the fruits, greatly annoying Qin Sang. Fearing exposure, he could only give perfunctory replies.</p><p>"I wonder what treasures the Lord Nine-Phoenix King found inside?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu secretly glanced into the depths of the space, mysteriously leaning closer and whispering, "Friend Daoist, what are your thoughts on the Lord Nine-Phoenix King's sudden appearance in the Seven Killing Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, giving Yuan Zhu a deep look. "What does Yuan Daoist mean? We are of low cultivation; how could we dare have any thoughts? We only need to follow orders."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled, ceasing further questioning.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang collected over a dozen fruits, with Yuan Zhu shamelessly obtaining one as well.</p><p>The remaining fruits were taken by the Fairy in Colorful Clothes and Gu Heng using some unknown method.</p><p>The red algae on the outer edges were all harvested. Qin Sang looked towards the depths of the space, hesitating before finally giving up; he didn't want to attract the Nine-Phoenix King's attention.</p><p>He was very nervous, unsure how much longer he could remain hidden.</p><p>The reason he hadn't been discovered was that the Nine-Phoenix King hadn't expected a human to infiltrate and hadn't noticed him.  A simple probe would expose Qin Sang instantly.</p><p>Just then, the restrictions deep within the space fluctuated, and the Nine-Phoenix King returned, covered in blood.</p>
