<h1>Chapter 1783: The Blight Origin</h1><p>Qin Sang knew nothing of the exchange between Master Zhan Gui and the others.</p><p>Master Zhi Jian stood at the cliff edge, waiting for Qin Sang to emerge before they returned to Sword Heart Island using their flying swords.</p><p>“How did it go?”</p><p>Master Zhi Jian asked.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “The Celestial Court wants me to infiltrate Gui Fang.”</p><p>Master Zhi Jian wasn’t surprised.  He and Qin Sang had previously discussed this possibility, concluding it was the most likely scenario.  The Daoist sect had countless powerful cultivators; missions that were easy and safe could be handled by the Celestial Court officials themselves. Only a mission as unpredictable as infiltrating Gui Fang would be delegated to an outsider.</p><p>“They want me to investigate a certain hidden realm, supposedly near some demon king’s manor. The details are unclear. Once in Gui Fang, someone will contact me…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly summarized the contents of the summons. There wasn’t much to hide; he wouldn’t know the specifics of the hidden realm until he reached Gui Fang anyway. This also indicated further variables.</p><p>“Near a manor?” Master Zhi Jian frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, that was precisely his concern.  A manor referred to a Gui Fang prince’s mansion, not comparable to a demon king’s lair in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Gui Fang’s princes, commonly known as demon kings within the Daoist sect, were equivalent to the Celestial Court's Grand Masters—all Transcendent Void cultivators! He could mask his aura and disguise himself as a demon cultivator, so he should be able to deceive other demon cultivators of the same level. But who knows if he might cause a commotion in the hidden realm? Though the summons mentioned a distance from the manor, Qin Sang couldn't ignore the possibility of attracting the attention of a demon king.  He’d never encountered the abilities of a Transcendent Void cultivator and had no desire to test his luck with his own life. Ironically, this was considered one of the easier summons.</p><p>Master Zhi Jian, after learning about Qin Sang’s interaction with Master Zhan Gui, also shook his head repeatedly.  “Your luck is poor, friend. Both summons are difficult and fraught with danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained optimistic. “Thankfully, I have you with me, and Master Zhan Gui was accommodating. The first summons was likely intended for a true Cave Xuan Master. If it had been forced upon me, I would have had no choice but to accept.”</p><p>They spoke for a while longer. Master Zhi Jian asked about Qin Sang’s plans.</p><p>Qin Sang countered, “Have you reached any conclusions?”</p><p>Master Zhi Jian nodded. “While one piece of information remains unconfirmed, it's almost certain. Master You Huang, Master Gu Yun, and I are preparing; it shouldn't take too long. I will explain the situation to you now…”</p><p>Master Zhi Jian looked around cautiously, setting up a soundproofing barrier before slowly recounting the plan.  Intrigued by his seriousness, Qin Sang listened patiently.</p><p>Soon, Master Zhi Jian finished, looking at Qin Sang. “What do you think?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment.  Master Zhi Jian and the others planned to venture deep into the Blight Origin and confront the demons of Gui Fang.</p><p>“Capturing a demon Marquis can grant us advancement?” Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>“A live capture is best; the Celestial Court will lavishly reward us. Even if we divide the reward equally, the Celestial Court won't be stingy with a single spell. If we can’t capture one alive, killing a demon Marquis is also a significant accomplishment. Even if your contribution alone isn’t enough, we’ll give you a larger share. If you feel uneasy about it, you can return it later.  Fellow cultivators should help each other.  Both Masters aren't petty,” Master Zhi Jian said confidently, as if slaying a Gui Fang demon Marquis was a trivial task.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The depths of the Blight Origin were different from Gui Fang itself. With the four of them working together, and with the element of surprise, their chances of success were indeed high.</p><p>According to Master Zhi Jian, the Celestial Court had discovered that the Gui Fang demons were plotting something in the Blight Origin, with a demon Marquis appearing there. To avoid alerting them, the Celestial Court hadn’t launched a large-scale operation. Cave Xuan Masters were usually sect leaders or held important positions, making it inconvenient for them to act easily.  Cultivators like them, with relatively low profiles, were better suited for this task.</p><p>However, the Celestial Court would certainly make other arrangements. With enough patience, waiting for both sides to clash directly would provide an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos.</p><p>Master Zhi Jian smiled again. “If we manage to uncover the demons' secrets, a mere spell is nothing. We might even be able to request guidance from a Grand Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded at the prospect.  Guidance from a Grand Master was an invaluable opportunity! After receiving the Five Thunder Secret Spell, he would focus on cultivation; reaching the Transcendent Void realm was no longer far-fetched.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't blinded by this.  Gui Fang's demon Marquis would undoubtedly know the risks and would likely act in groups, making it difficult to find a lone target.  That was secondary; they could hide and wait for the right moment.</p><p>Qin Sang's main concern was the scale of the plot. If it was important enough to warrant the Celestial Court's attention, it wasn't just a few demon Marquises; were demon kings involved? If they attracted a demon king, Master Zhi Jian's outwardly strong but inwardly weak sword might not deter them.</p><p>The Sword Master saw Qin Sang's worry and changed his tone, "Friend Daoist, have you ever seen a Grand Master of the Daoist sect make a move? Have you ever heard of any Grand Master personally intervening in a matter?"</p><p>"Never," Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Although he didn't know the exact reasons, he had gleaned some information over the years. Unless it was a war with Guifang, the Grand Masters rarely left the Daoist courts, rarely appearing in the outside world.</p><p>"Because Grand Masters rarely leave their designated areas!"</p><p>The Sword Master glanced southwest, "Cultivating to the Five Talismans rank, pursuing the unity of heaven and man, one can borrow the creation of heaven and earth to benefit oneself, extending lifespan almost endlessly, with every move wielding the power of heaven and earth. But because of this, once a Grand Master leaves their area too far, their harmonious energy with heaven and earth cannot be hidden, causing wind and thunder, and other strange phenomena to appear.  The Guifang demon king is the same."</p><p>Pausing, the Sword Master pointed towards the northern Blight Marsh, "Therefore, it's actually more convenient for us to act.  Imagine, Daoist friend, if a Grand Master enters the Blight Marsh, they would be like a bright lamp in the dark, attracting all the ferocious beasts to frenzy. With such a commotion, we'd know long before they even get close to the demon king."</p><p>"Unity of heaven and man…"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to understand.</p><p>The fear of death is something that Yuan Ying and Hua Shen cultivators have.</p><p>Upon reaching Yuan Ying stage, they are already detached from the mundane world, having various methods to replenish their energy, making their lifespan unpredictable. It depends on the cultivator's techniques, cultivation experience, health practices, and environment.</p><p>There are even differences between body cultivators, spell cultivators, and spirit cultivators.</p><p>Generally, their lifespans are around fifteen hundred years, with variations of several hundred years possible. Hua Shen cultivators' lifespans roughly double.</p><p>However, heavenly tribulations are more terrifying, most don't die of old age.</p><p>Once they break through to the Lianxu realm, they only need to guard against heavenly tribulations.</p><p>It is said that the Lianxu tribulation is a six-nine tribulation that occurs once every three thousand years, far more powerful than the four-nine tribulation, thus breaking through to Lianxu doesn't mean one can rest easy.</p><p>When Qin Sang learned that the key to breaking through to the Hua Shen stage lies in the connection with heaven and man, he deduced that Lianxu might require seeking the unity of heaven and man, unexpectedly finding this drawback in this world where heaven and earth merge.</p><p>The Sword Master could unleash a sword strike nearly on par with a Lianxu cultivator, certainly having received a great inheritance, so knowing this isn't surprising.</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang became curious about the Daoist court's designated area.</p><p>The designated area, as the core of a region, seems to be more than just a place for teaching.</p><p>This made him realize he had never heard of the location of the designated area in Jushan.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang asked, "Friend Daoist, how long do you plan to stay in the Blight Marsh?"</p><p>"It's hard to say now, it depends on how far the place is and the situation, but it definitely won't be long," the Sword Master explained.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>If that was the case, he could go with the Sword Master first.  If they returned empty-handed, he could then complete the summons.</p><p>The summons didn't specify a time, so it should be quite flexible.</p><p>He didn't hesitate any longer and agreed.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, the two returned to Jianxin Island, where Youhuang and Guyun were already waiting.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang would go with them, the two exchanged a glance. They weren't happy, but they didn't refuse on the spot.</p><p>They both knew Qin Sang was seeking advancement qualification.</p><p>Youhuang turned to the Sword Master, "Qingfeng Daoist is still a second-rank cultivator; the protective deity can only protect the Shengxuan rank. In the Blight Marsh, the impact on him will be far greater than on us. We might last longer. Shall we return together later?"</p><p>Guyun also said, "Although Qingfeng Daoist has a Dingzhen Pill, only one, the situation we will face is too complex, I'm afraid…"</p><p>The two expressed their concerns.</p><p>Previously, the Sword Master had not revealed Qin Sang's background to them.</p><p>Qin Sang remained expressionless.</p><p>But the Sword Master laughed, "Master Youhuang needn't worry, I happen to have a few pills to stabilize the spirit, although they can't completely resist the six-day evil energy, they can be used as a stopgap measure."</p><p>Youhuang nodded slightly.  They wouldn't stay in the Blight Marsh for too long, as long as they kept their wits about them, they could recover slowly upon their return.</p><p>Then, the Sword Master turned to Guyun, "You underestimate Qingfeng Daoist. Qingfeng Daoist is a cultivator of both body and spell. During our last encounter, he displayed powerful body cultivation, capable of holding two people back. At a critical moment, we may need to rely on Qingfeng Daoist."</p><p>"Cultivates both body and spell?"</p><p>Guyun's eyes showed surprise, looking at Qin Sang in astonishment.</p><p>Those who cultivate both body and spell are rare in this world, and it's even less likely for those who cultivate at the Longhu altar to do so.</p><p>Qin Sang simply said it was a stroke of luck.</p><p>He had already revealed this to the Sword Master before, no need to hide it from these two, especially since their goal was the demon marquis and they needed to cooperate sincerely.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>The Sword Master stopped the eager Guyun, "I know you're eager for battle, but now is not the time for sparring.  There will be plenty of opportunities to fight in the Blight Marsh."</p><p>Having said this,  Zhijjian Zhenren turned to Qin Sang, "Before you leave, Daoist Qingfeng, is there anything else you need to do? Let's brainstorm and share information to prepare as quickly as possible, so we won't be caught off guard."</p><p>The Huifeng Armor was already refined, so Qin Sang actually had nothing to do.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had a thought, "Do you remember the Emperor Bell True Talisman? I've been collecting materials everywhere, but I'm still missing Kun Earth Blood Sand. I haven't heard any news."</p><p>Zhijjian Zhenren looked at Guyun Zhenren, "I remember Daoist Guyun has a piece of Kun Earth Blood Sand."</p><p>Guyun Zhenren immediately produced it – a fist-sized blood-red stone.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was composed of countless tiny, rice-grain sized crystals.</p><p>With some refining, it could be turned into cinnabar for talisman drawing.</p><p>Qin Sang also took out the spiritual materials he had collected.</p><p>Zhijjian Zhenren examined them, saying, "These are enough to refine three Emperor Bell True Talismans."</p><p>Guyun Zhenren interjected, "I have a friend who is skilled in talisman creation. We can ask him to make them, and I'll provide any missing materials. If we get more than two, how about you give me one?"</p><p>This last sentence was addressed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Good," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Cultivators in this world can all draw talismans, but the success rate varies greatly; not everyone can become a master.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he made them himself, he would be lucky to refine one.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren laughed heartily, sweeping his wide sleeves and collecting all the materials.</p><p>After a while of further discussion, everyone departed.</p><p>Qin Sang first returned to Hu Zhong Island, found Master Qi, retrieved the Huifeng Armor, and informed him that he would be away for a while.</p><p>Master Qi seemed quite reluctant, whether it was because of their camaraderie or his attachment to the Huifeng Armor.</p><p>Then Qin Sang vacated his cave dwelling on Hu Zhong Island and went into seclusion on Jianxin Island.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a year passed.</p><p>During that time, Guyun Zhenren visited once, telling Qin Sang that only two Emperor Bell True Talismans were successfully refined, one for each person.</p><p>With no news for so long, when the four of them gathered again, Youhuang Zhenren suspected that the Celestial Court might have exaggerated, turning the whole thing into a farce that wasted everyone's time.</p><p>After several more months, just as Qin Sang was considering going to Guifang Country to investigate, the news finally arrived!</p><p>…</p><p>Jianxin Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhijian Zhenren stood side by side, while an old man who addressed himself as a servant stood nearby. His cultivation was not weak, but he was unable to participate in this level of battle and could only guard the cave.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two streams of light arrived simultaneously, speeding to them.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren landed and immediately asked, "Confirmed?"</p><p>Zhijjian Zhenren nodded, "Rest assured, Daoist, the source is absolutely reliable! The Guifang Country's demon lords are moving, heading in that direction. We haven't identified which demon lords yet, but time is pressing; we can't wait any longer."</p><p>"How long ago did they leave?" Guyun Zhenren pressed.</p><p>"Two days ago, but the news just arrived," Zhijian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>All were top-tier experts; the difference in speed wouldn't be significant, and they had to hurry.</p><p>"It shouldn't be just us, right?  Being a bit slower might not be a bad thing," Youhuang Zhenren's expression relaxed.</p><p>"Definitely others involved.  The Celestial Court's tricks are well-known," Guyun Zhenren scoffed.</p><p>With that, everyone prepared and set off north.</p><p>They arrived smoothly at the north shore of Xingdao Immortal Lake.</p><p>A vast expanse of tall yellow grass greeted them, reaching up to twice a man's height, like a dense jungle.</p><p>Entering the land, the four continued to fly at high altitude.</p><p>The grassland was incredibly wide; they flew for a while before reaching its edge.</p><p>Luckily, they didn't encounter a single beast along the way.</p><p>Zhijjian Zhenren stopped in front, saying gravely, "Beasts abound ahead. Everyone be careful! If you encounter a beast, make it quick!"</p><p>Then, he handed Qin Sang several jade bottles, instructing him on their use.</p><p>Inside were various types of pills, clearly the accumulation of Zhijian Zhenren's many years, all given to Qin Sang.</p>
