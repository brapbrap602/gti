<h1>Chapter 1512: Extremity (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1512: Extremity (4k)</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi’s arrangement of the stone tablet space was quite thorough; it wasn't a dead end, otherwise leaving treasures would be pointless.</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to place the Futu Pagoda in her hand on the jade platform to activate the entire formation and seal the stone tablet space.</p><p>At the last moment, the Futu Pagoda would trigger the Linglong Pagoda, sending those inside out of the sacred land.</p><p>Following Xiao Xiangzi’s instructions on the jade slip, Qin Sang completely mastered the Futu Pagoda.</p><p>Demonic creatures surrounded the Linglong Pagoda, but luckily, Xiao Xiangzi had left them an escape route.</p><p>However, once the spirit array was activated, the demons outside probably wouldn't fare well.</p><p>Qin Sang urged Jiang Dianzhu and the others to leave quickly, worried about them being implicated.</p><p>Upon learning the details, a look of shock flashed in Liuli’s eyes.</p><p>Annihilating so many demons in one fell swoop—with the Nine-Headed Saint lineage still supporting the demon race, the Boundless Sea would face an unprecedented reshuffling.</p><p>If Qin Sang's prediction came true, the demonic path would suffer a devastating blow, leaving everything clean.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, picking up the jade box.</p><p>The moment the jade box opened, Qin Sang and Liuli felt their eyes brighten, a green fluorescence instantly illuminating the seventh-level space.</p><p>A delicate fragrance filled their nostrils, seemingly containing the scents of various plants and trees, yet highly unified. Qin Sang felt as if he were in a vibrant jungle.</p><p>The fragrance was refreshing and calming.</p><p>Just smelling the fragrance had such an effect; the Spirit-Calming Incense truly lived up to its name.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, seeing four slender jade sticks, almost jade-like in texture, neatly arranged in the jade box—the Spirit-Calming Incense. Each was crystal-clear and flawless, like naturally formed treasures.</p><p>The Spirit-Calming Incense could calm the mind, suppress inner demons, and was highly useful during breakthroughs and tribulation crossings, a rare and precious treasure.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang possessed the even more powerful Jade Buddha; the Spirit-Calming Incense in his hands was like a pearl gathering dust, only good for trading with others.</p><p>However, for Liuli, the Spirit-Calming Incense held profound significance.</p><p>The evil art imprint was like a heart demon for Liuli.</p><p>Even if it couldn't completely eliminate the evil art imprint, it could help Liuli suppress the imprint during future breakthroughs, reducing its influence.</p><p>After the battle with Yin Changsheng, Liuli had voluntarily released her seal, becoming his Xuan Nu. Qin Sang, feeling moved, had seriously considered how he could help her.</p><p>He didn't possess his senior sister's amazing talent in puppetry, unable to create a heart demon puppet imprint; the closest thing he had was the *Wu Sheng Demon Imprint*.</p><p>But cultivating the *Wu Sheng Demon Imprint* was extremely dangerous, similar to actively creating a heart demon, nurturing it little by little, and finally breaking through by shattering the imprint.</p><p>The imprint within Liuli was already severe enough to affect her cultivation. If Liuli dared to cultivate the *Wu Sheng Demon Imprint*, she would likely be instantly devoured by her heart demon.</p><p>The Spirit-Calming Incense might help her temporarily overcome this hurdle; with improved cultivation and strength, more possibilities would arise.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>Liuli’s gaze was also drawn to the Spirit-Calming Incense. After staring for a moment, she exclaimed in surprise, "Is this Spirit-Calming Incense?"</p><p>"You recognize it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then remembered that Xiao Xiangzi and Xuan Tian Palace had deep connections; Xuan Tian Palace might have records of the Spirit-Calming Incense.</p><p>Liuli nodded slightly, silent for a moment before looking up at Qin Sang.</p><p>Her eyes were as clear as glass, showing anticipation, but no greed.</p><p>"If you are willing to let the Four-Ride Serpent Imprint acknowledge me as its master, give me some time, and I have a 70% chance of comprehending the complete Tongbao Scripture."</p><p>Liuli paused, adding, "Then I can sever the connection between myself and the spiritual treasure, not affecting your control of the treasure."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flickered with surprise.</p><p>He had thought that the Tongbao Scripture would be permanently incomplete with Yin Changsheng's fall, but unexpectedly, there was a twist of fate.</p><p>This contradicted Tong Lingyu’s statement. She had said that if the refiner of a spiritual treasure hadn't inscribed the Tongbao Scripture onto it, once the scripture was lost, only the spiritual treasure’s willingly chosen master could wield it.</p><p>Was this true for all spiritual treasures, or was the Four-Ride Serpent Imprint special?</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the former was more likely.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's understanding of spiritual treasures was only superficial; there might be many places where she had been misled by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>A half-complete Tongbao Scripture and a complete one were worlds apart; the former was merely a useless bone!</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't blinded by this good news. He looked at Liuli, his expression unusual.</p><p>"I wish to exchange for a piece of Tranquil Spirit Incense!"</p><p>Liuli took a deep breath and said.</p><p>She could easily conceal this matter, finding a way to reclaim the Four-Serpent Seal from Qin Sang.</p><p>With only half of the Treasured Scripture, the Four-Serpent Seal in Qin Sang's possession was significantly weakened, far inferior to the Sun God Tree, and therefore dispensable.</p><p>As long as the Xuan Tian Palace showed sufficient sincerity, there was a chance of persuading Qin Sang.</p><p>But Liuli chose the Tranquil Spirit Incense.</p><p>She understood the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique," and one day, upon becoming a Grand Cultivator, she could refine her life essence treasure into a pseudo-spiritual treasure, a reasonable substitute.</p><p>Until then, possessing the top-tier divine ability, "Ice Soul Divine Light," she wouldn't lack methods for surpassing her cultivation level in combat.</p><p>Tranquil Spirit Incense was a rare and precious item, offering her the possibility to continue her cultivation journey.</p><p>Spiritual treasures were tempting, but they couldn't sway Liuli's resolve.</p><p>As for the legacy of Xuan Tian Palace…</p><p>She held no affection for Xuan Tian Palace; she followed her master first, later cultivating on Shao Hua Mountain, returning to the North Sea only after reaching the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>After the battle with Yin Changsheng, and considering her master's forced exile and wandering, she could hardly feel any fondness for it.</p><p>She only recognized the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>And not only because of her master.</p><p>Shi Xue and Master Jiang both cherished and cared for her deeply.</p><p>Liuli had already planned how to strengthen the Listening Snow Tower, continue her master's legacy, and repay their kindness.</p><p>"Actually, your cultivation technique and the Four-Serpent Seal aren't compatible.  This treasure is quite special; only those cultivating ice-type techniques can unleash its full power. Your external manifestation is better suited to it than your main body."</p><p>Liuli pointed out another issue.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, knowing Liuli had no reason to deceive him.</p><p>He had already sensed it; when Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu wielded the Four-Serpent Seal, a chilling aura emanated, not solely from the treasure, but also from the wielder.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't change his cultivation technique, only hoping his external manifestation could break through to the late Yuan Ying stage to fully utilize its power.</p><p>His manifestation reaching the mid-Yuan Ying stage was the result of several fortunate opportunities; further breakthroughs would be extremely difficult.</p><p>By pointing this out before the exchange, Liuli was clearly diminishing her bargaining chips.</p><p>"After refining the 'Ice Soul Divine Light' using Ice Soul Essence, I discovered that cultivating this technique isn't as difficult as previously imagined; it's that the Listening Snow Tower's ancestors took a roundabout path. I've had some insights and slightly modified the technique, making it possible for others to cultivate it as well.  I can then pass this technique to you. While your manifestation using Ice Soul Essence for its foundation might not meet all the other requirements, there's still a slight chance it could succeed…"</p><p>Liuli accelerated her speech, offering a second bargaining chip.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang lacked such thoughts, who could resist these two conditions?</p><p>Looking deeply at Liuli, Qin Sang sighed softly, "Why must you do this, Immortal? We only entered the tower through cooperation. How could I monopolize the treasures? Moreover, I borrowed Ice Soul Essence from you before. To be frank, in my opinion, although the Tranquil Spirit Incense is highly valuable, it's not as important as the other two fragments. I've been searching for these fragments for years; they're essential to me. I cannot share them with you, but…"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, Liuli shook her head in refusal, her face serious.  "The Essence was for the Eight-Winged Ice Cicada; you've already done that and suffered repercussions because of it. We entered the Exquisite Treasure Pagoda because of your miniature pagoda. Moreover, you could have passed the demon horde even without me."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, not knowing how to persuade Liuli.</p><p>This was his first such experience; he was offering a treasure to someone who was desperately refusing it.</p><p>Qin Sang understood clearly; Liuli was deliberately distancing herself from him, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p><p>Refusing to benefit even slightly from him!</p><p>Regardless of how flimsy the reasons might seem.</p><p>It was enough to convince herself.</p><p>Previously, when Liuli interacted with him, she also held to this principle, but not as deliberately.</p><p>Liuli releasing the imprint, the remaining hidden danger was far more terrifying than imagined!</p><p>This wicked technique truly had endless repercussions!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, feeling helpless.</p><p>Others would grab every advantage they could, but Liuli did the opposite.</p><p>One extreme versus another.</p><p>Qin Sang had never experienced this, didn't understand the feeling of being controlled by an imprint, and couldn't empathize with Liuli.</p><p>Judging from Liuli's actions, she wouldn't share her troubles or seek his help.</p><p>Intuition told Qin Sang that such an extreme approach might not be effective. Liuli's excessive consideration would only deepen her predicament, becoming another obsession!</p><p>But wicked techniques were unpredictable. With Liuli isolating herself, Qin Sang couldn't offer better advice, so he helplessly reminded her, "Immortal, you're becoming too fixated…"</p><p>Liuli paused slightly, but her gaze remained firm, unwilling to change her mind.</p><p>“Good! I accept!”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a sigh, his expression turning serious. He nodded heavily, agreeing to the matter.  He took two Zhenling incense sticks from a jade box, closed the box, and offered it to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>“Is a spiritual treasure really not worth two Zhenling incense sticks?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“To you, indeed not,”</p><p>Liuli replied.</p><p>Tong Lingyu wouldn't dare to haggle; the spiritual treasure belonged to Qin Sang.</p><p>Treasures have different uses and suit different people.  One person's dream treasure might be discarded as worthless by another.  Their value can't be simply measured.</p><p>She knew Qin Sang possessed the Sun God Tree, which was no less powerful than a four-headed serpent seal. The black spiritual fire of the demonic banner wasn’t as simple as it appeared.  He didn’t lack powerful magical treasures or abilities; the four-headed serpent seal wasn't a necessity for Qin Sang.  Having four Zhenling incense sticks, however, might offer a slight chance at achieving godhood – something no spiritual treasure could compare to.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “Qin has possessed a firm Dao heart since the Foundation Establishment stage. Now, at the Yuan Ying stage, how could I regress and be hindered by inner demons? Besides, you can’t deny the role you played in dealing with the Hun Mo Elder.  Are you trying to force me into an unrighteous position?”</p><p>Qin Sang could rival Yuan Ying cultivators in Dao heart even during his Foundation Establishment stage. Liuli had witnessed this firsthand.</p><p>Liuli was silent for a moment, finally refraining from arguing. She reached out and took the jade box.</p><p>The moment his hand lightened, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief, as if he had fought a great battle. He carefully put away the two Zhenling incense sticks.</p><p>“If you need them in the future, you can find me to exchange for Zhenling incense. Then you’ll understand that I don't particularly value them.”</p><p>After a pause, looking into Liuli’s clear eyes, Qin Sang added, “Fair trade.”</p><p>Liuli replied, “Good.”</p><p>Next, Qin Sang picked up the fragments of the killing sword.  The instant his fingers touched them, he felt the fragments within him tremble – the sword spirit was finally reacting.</p><p>The fragments silently vanished from his fingertips.  Without receiving a response from the sword spirit, Qin Sang delved into his Qi Sea. He found all the fragments had merged seamlessly, forming a perfect whole!</p><p>The sword body was slender, yet possessed an inexplicable weight.  Neither the blade nor the tip felt particularly sharp, whether that was the sword's inherent nature or because it hadn't fully recovered.</p><p>The ancient characters ‘Earth’ and ‘Kill’ on the sword body were imbued with profound meaning; they seemed both simple and all-encompassing. Qin Sang felt he could contemplate those two characters for a very long time…</p><p>The four fragments had formed a complete sword body, but lacked a hilt. Because of this, Qin Sang couldn't be certain if this Earth-Killing Sword was complete.  There might be a hilt, or perhaps another fragment. He couldn't give up searching before the sword spirit awakened.</p><p>The serious problem was the lack of cultivation techniques in the jade slip. Xiao Xiangzi hadn't mentioned them either.  According to his records, he obtained these two fragments in Central Plains, from an ancient immortal mansion, specifically the Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Halls. Xiao Xiangzi speculated that the remaining fragments might be in similar immortal mansions. He urged future finders to search thoroughly if they discovered any.</p><p>To investigate the whereabouts of the cultivation techniques, Qin Sang had to start with Xiao Xiangzi's background, perhaps even traveling to the Central Plains! Unfortunately, the Jing Hai Sect no longer existed, and the Xuan Tian Palace's records were lost.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Linglong Pagoda shook violently.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and put away the jade slip. It contained much more information, but he couldn't examine it now. He needed to escape the danger first.</p><p>“It should be almost time…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.  Calculating the time, if Jiang Dianzhu and the others heeded the warning and immediately retreated, they should be leaving the stele space soon.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer. If the golden light barrier was breached, the demons would rush into the tower. The golden light barrier wasn't primarily for defense; its true function was to conceal the activation of the Linglong Pagoda, avoiding detection by the demonic leaders.</p><p>Activating the spirit array wasn't instantaneous, it took time. Now, with demons outside the Linglong Pagoda, there was no need for concealment.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Liuli, picked up the Futu Pagoda, and gently placed it in the center of the jade platform.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The Futu Pagoda and jade platform merged as one.  A flash of light, an invisible ripple spread out, permeating the entire Linglong Pagoda.  Their energies completely fused.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face changed slightly; he felt as if his true energy was being sucked into a black hole.</p><p>Thanks to Xiao Xiangzi’s warning, Qin Sang didn't panic; he remained calm, focusing all his attention on the Futu Pagoda. Through it, he felt his thoughts extending outwards infinitely.</p><p>First, the Linglong Pagoda, then expanding rapidly until he sensed the entire spirit array.  The array was extremely profound. Qin Sang had seen more sophisticated and grand immortal arrays, but this method of contact was a revelation! He dared not act recklessly, following Xiao Xiangzi's instructions to activate the great array step-by-step.</p>
