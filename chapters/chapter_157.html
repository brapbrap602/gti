<h1>Chapter 150: Mysterious Yin Lightning</h1><p>Shopkeeper Wu recognized it at a glance and was shocked, "It's the Mysterious Yin Lightning!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang looking at him in confusion, Shopkeeper Wu took the initiative to explain, "Weapon refining is just a minor skill. Fellow Daoist Qin focuses on cultivating the Great Dao, so you may not have heard of the Mysterious Yin Lightning. Thousands of years ago, the Mysterious Yin Lightning was a famous demonic weapon from a demonic sect called the Nether God Sect. It once made righteous cultivators tremble in fear. The Thunderbolt was also famous in the cultivation world. After the Nether God Sect was destroyed, the method of refining it was also lost. It has been a long time since anyone has heard of the Mysterious Yin Lightning circulating in the world..."</p><p>As he spoke, Shopkeeper Wu leaned closer, lovingly holding the Mysterious Yin Lightning and looking at it over and over again, wishing he could shove it into his eyes. His face was filled with obsession, and he praised it again and again.</p><p>"What a great artifact! What great craftsmanship!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I indeed obtained it from a demonic cultivator. What's so special about this Mysterious Yin Lightning?"</p><p>"Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Qin didn't let that demonic beast activate the Mysterious Yin Lightning!"</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu said with a serious expression, "This item is the one-time artifact I mentioned. You only need to activate the restriction on it with your divine sense to detonate it, unleashing terrifying power with astonishing momentum. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be severely injured if they were caught off guard. Its only flaw is that its range is slightly smaller, and the explosive power is concentrated within a one-zhang radius core area. The aftershock is much weaker."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a sense of fear. When he fell into the Three Calamities Heart Devouring Formation at the foot of Yuanzhao Peak, he didn't see the real explosion. He didn't expect that even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would find it difficult to resist.</p><p>The Mysterious Yin Lightning was so powerful.</p><p>The two Mysterious Yin Lightnings that Zhao Yan had should have been given to him by the old ghost Yi Tiannie as a means of self-defense. For the sake of the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid, Old Yi had really gone all out.</p><p>If he hadn't made a quick decision and escaped, he would have turned into dust.</p><p>When the snake demon broke free from the Ten Directions Yama Formation, Qin Sang had planned to use the Mysterious Yin Lightning to force it back. He hesitated for a moment and didn't activate it. Fortunately, he didn't. Otherwise, it would have been a complete waste.</p><p>After letting Shopkeeper Wu have his fill, Qin Sang took the Mysterious Yin Lightning back.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu also knew that Qin Sang was unlikely to give it to him for research. He watched eagerly as Qin Sang put the Mysterious Yin Lightning into his mustard seed bag.</p><p>"As Fellow Daoist Wu said, let's refine a Soul Devouring Cone! I wonder how much it will cost?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly made a decision. He didn't lack top-grade artifacts. What he lacked was a life-saving method in times of danger. No matter how precious the materials were, as long as they could发挥作用, he wouldn't feel心疼.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu said, "To be honest with Fellow Daoist Qin, there's no guarantee that weapon refining will be successful, and the quality will also vary. We don't dare to collect a reward in advance before it's finished. That's why we need to agree on a few conditions before refining it. Of course, I will do my best. If Fellow Daoist Qin has any concerns, then we can only..."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his understanding. Just like breaking through barriers, how could one break through just by saying so? Otherwise, cultivation would be too simple.</p><p>Unless one deliberately wanted to fail, no one wanted to fail. This Shopkeeper Wu was a fanatic about weapon refining. He shouldn't do anything that would harm others but not benefit himself.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the snake demon's fragments and said, "If we refine the Soul Devouring Cone, which of these things will be useless?"</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu glanced at them and said, "The poisonous fangs, scales, and beast bones can be left behind. I can help Fellow Daoist refine a few small artifacts."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and gently waved his finger. "I'll give them all to Fellow Daoist Wu. Can you let me watch you refine weapons?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu hesitated. These were indeed all good materials, especially the poisonous fangs. At the very least, half of them could be saved. When refining spirit swords in the future, adding them in could increase their power by a few points.</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Wu. I'll only watch and not ask questions. I just want to observe the process of weapon refining. If it involves any of your family's confidential secrets, you can ask me to leave."</p><p>Qin Sang was indeed curious about weapon refining and alchemy and wanted to broaden his horizons.</p><p>He knew his own limits. With his talent, it was impossible for him to be distracted by anything else. However, many low-grade artifacts were also very effective. If he could learn a few tricks, he wouldn't have to ask for help from others.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu was ultimately unable to resist the temptation and said with a wry smile, "It's just a superficial technique. There's nothing confidential. If Fellow Daoist Qin doesn't mind the poor conditions of my humble abode, please follow me."</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of Wenyue Market, activated his Flying Shuttle, transformed into a stream of light, and flew past the gates of Mount Shaohua. He didn't enter but flew straight to the Ancient Abyss Nation.</p><p>When he flew to a place where there was no one, Qin Sang raised his hand, and a small, palm-sized horn appeared in his palm.</p><p>The horn was slightly curved upwards and looked exactly like a rhino horn, except that it had become much smaller after being refined. The horn was aqua-blue in color, almost transparent. It was wrapped in circles of golden patterns. At the tip of the horn was a needle-like spike that glowed with an emerald green light.</p><p>This was the Soul Devouring Cone that Shopkeeper Wu had refined.</p><p>Qin Sang examines the Devouring Soul Cone and puts it away in his Sumeru Pouch, his face showing a look of contemplation. He had watched the whole refining process by Shopkeeper Wu, and it was just as he had imagined. The refining process was extremely complicated, consuming a great deal of time and energy, which was exactly what he lacked the most.</p><p>It is said that concocting elixirs is even more difficult than refining tools.</p><p>The reward for the Devouring Soul Cone was to leave the almost-completely-discarded Dragon Sword with the Shopkeeper for a year of observation. After breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang saw some clues. The prohibition on the sword was not from the Demonic Sect, but a unique refining prohibition.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu had not forgotten the Dragon Sword all this time, and was overjoyed. He gave him a summary of his refining experience, which might be of some help when he refined his natal magic weapon in the future.</p><p>As they approached the Ancient Abyss Nation, Qin Sang complained that the sky shuttle was too slow, so he summoned his Ebonywood Sword and turned it into a beam of sword light, increasing his speed significantly.</p><p>He had not been back for more than a month. It felt as if he had left his own child at home alone and couldn't rest assured, and his heart felt like it was being clawed at by something.</p><p>When he returned to his cave dwelling and saw the Nine Fantasy Heavenly Orchid safe and sound, his heart was finally at peace. Qin Sang crouched at the water pool, and took a handful of pool water in his hands, murmuring: "I wonder when the spirit spring will be formed? Otherwise, how can I be at ease when leaving?"</p><p>...</p><p>Closing off the cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat down with his legs crossed.</p><p>Although he had let the snake demon escape, the fight had been even more intense than the one with the White Rhinoceros Monster, and the experience was much more profound. His understanding of the Killing Sigil had deepened.</p><p>His mind was in a state of tranquility, visualizing the Killing Sigil. It seemed much more solid than before.</p><p>The extreme killing intent was introduced into the Nascent Soul, refining the Spirit Sword within the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Just then, a look of joy suddenly appeared on Qin Sang's face. The bottleneck that had been troubling him before was broken through with ease. He just needed to cultivate in seclusion for a while longer, and he could break through naturally and inscribe the Killing Sigil on the sword, forging a natal Spirit Sword!</p><p>Spring comes, and autumn goes.</p><p>Time passed, day after day. Qin Sang returned to his previous state, and except for his monthly trips to the Returning Dragon Temple, he remained in seclusion. A year later, a communication talisman flew over to the Returning Dragon Temple from Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Qin Sang happened to be at the Returning Dragon Temple. He caught the communication talisman and read its contents, pondering over it for a long time. He then rose into the air on a beam of light and headed straight for Mount Shaohua.</p>
