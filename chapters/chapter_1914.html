<h1>Chapter 1905: Establishing the Mansion</h1><p>Red flames danced on the surface of the magma.</p><p>Within the sea of fire, the flames in some areas burned far deeper than their surroundings, outlining countless strange runes that formed a massive circular spirit array, hidden beneath the magma lake for many years.</p><p>The array’s edge showed a clear break, revealing it to be a fragmented formation.</p><p>Beneath these flames, numerous fire-red jade stones of varying sizes were submerged in the magma, their material identical to the token in Fashen's possession.</p><p>They could be considered the foundation of the spirit array, clearly artificially refined.</p><p>What was visible now was only the tip of the iceberg; a much larger structure lay beneath, resembling a grand city, though now ruined and dilapidated.</p><p>Fashen merged with the magma, moving through the spirit array.</p><p>Tianmudie fully activated its Dharma eye, helping to analyze the array.  Due to the vast difference in cultivation, Tianmudie could only offer limited assistance to Qin Sang.</p><p>As they continued to descend, the surrounding space grew increasingly constricted, the largest jade stones reaching the size of houses.</p><p>Fashen moved between two jade stones, as if walking through a narrow corridor in a palace.</p><p>Flames flickered across the jade surfaces, the runes in the firelight resembling exquisite murals.</p><p>“Such a grand layout…unless a high-level cultivator personally created it, a large power must be behind this…Could there have been a top-tier sect nearby?”</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully, making his deductions.</p><p>To his knowledge, the Northern Fire Region did indeed have some cultivation sects, but they were disunited, their influence and strength incomparable to Yun Du Shan, entirely dependent on Yun Du Tian’s favor.</p><p>“Fallen, then?”</p><p>Fashen accelerated, arriving unharmed at the center of the spirit array, finally finding a large hall constructed of jade.</p><p>The hall was severely dilapidated, half its roof collapsed, its walls askew.</p><p>Inscriptions were carved above the entrance; originally three characters, now only one remained.</p><p>A single character: ‘Palace.’</p><p>If he knew which palace, there might be a chance to discover the array's origin.</p><p>Unfortunately, even after examining it for a long time, Qin Sang couldn't decipher the missing characters, finding no useful clues.</p><p>Entering the hall, he found nothing but ruins and rubble, no treasures, even more meager than expected.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that a sudden catastrophe had forced the owners to flee with their treasures, or perhaps they were plundered by enemies.</p><p>Did the spirit array exist solely to protect this insignificant palace?</p><p>Something felt wrong to Qin Sang.</p><p>After some thought, Fashen returned to the top of the spirit array, looking down and extending his senses, the surrounding landscape appearing before him.</p><p>Streams of magma converged, some calm, some turbulent, some even concealing internal firestorms, filled with a furious energy.</p><p>After a moment, a gleam flashed in Fashen's eyes. He returned to the array, but not to the center, instead heading directly to one corner.</p><p>Soon, Fashen found his target: nine jade stones arranged in a circle, with an empty space in the middle.</p><p>Because the space was small and unremarkable, anyone would simply assume it was a natural result of the array’s structure, without further thought.</p><p>But in Fashen's eyes, this was the most unique place in the entire array!</p><p>Fashen dashed inside, looking around, carefully observing the nine jade stones, gradually gaining confidence. He pointed at one of them.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The jade stone emitted fire, as if about to melt under the intense heat.</p><p>The carvings on its surface grew increasingly clear, like coiling dragons and snakes.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>These 'dragons and snakes' came to life, emerging from the fire.</p><p>Streams of fire shot out, striking another jade stone, which immediately ignited, undergoing a similar transformation.</p><p>This continued until all nine jade stones were ablaze, a roaring inferno turning the place into a furnace.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Fashen felt the ground beneath him tremble violently. The flames spun rapidly, a vortex shining with deep firelight, like a passage opening to an unknown space.</p><p>Without hesitation, Fashen plunged into the vortex. Initially, he felt a twisting force, which quickly subsided, and the surrounding clamor vanished.</p><p>A sea of red!</p><p>In all directions, endless red fire.</p><p>A world of only flame, not large, yet gathering the power of surrounding fiery veins, the intensity of the fire far surpassing the outside.</p><p>This was the true core of the spirit array!</p><p>Fashen's gaze shifted to the center of the space, where a bronze pillar stood.</p><p>The pillar was ten feet tall, twice the width of a man’s embrace, encircled by red fire, its body also crimson, as if sculpted from red bronze.</p><p>The copper pillar's surface was densely covered with indecipherable runes.</p><p>Fasheng appeared before the pillar. Initially, he assumed it was some kind of treasure, perhaps being refined using the subterranean magma veins by whoever had set up the formation.  Closer inspection, however, revealed otherwise. While the pillar's material had undoubtedly changed from years of fiery refinement, this wasn't the original intention of whoever had created the formation.</p><p>Fasheng's gaze fell upon the runes, and he fell into contemplation.  Surprisingly, he found himself unable to fully understand the pillar's purpose; a crucial piece of the puzzle seemed missing.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang had a bold idea: there might be more than one pillar!  If this were true, other similar spirit formations might exist elsewhere.  Qin Sang hadn't expected such a development and his interest grew.</p><p>Fasheng reached out, his hand pressing against the pillar's surface, his consciousness and spiritual energy surging into it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A terrifying wave of fire engulfed him.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, in a certain lava river, a torrent of molten rock flowed rapidly. At the river's bottom, four figures walked through the lava.  All four were of varying heights, clad in large red cloaks that concealed their bodies completely.  These cloaks seemingly insulated against the lava, creating a barrier around them.</p><p>One person walked in the center, the other three positioned around him in a tripartite arrangement.  They moved in silence.</p><p>The central figure suddenly stopped, immediately prompting a reaction from his companions.</p><p>"The Flame Heart Jade is glowing!"</p><p>A raspy, chilling voice emanated from the center, the tone revealing a hint of excitement.  The person’s cloak trembled slightly as a crimson jade, radiating a fiery light, flew out. The jade hung suspended between them.</p><p>The tallest figure, positioned to the rear-left, exclaimed excitedly, "It's finally lit! It must be nearby!"  His voice was peculiar, like scraping metal.</p><p>"How do you know it's nearby?" a woman's voice questioned from the rear-right. Her voice, in stark contrast, was captivatingly seductive.</p><p>The tall man, unfazed by the allure, grumbled, "We've searched for so long without a response. It only lights up here—where else could it be?"</p><p>The woman didn't argue, turning to the leader at the front: "Lord Feiluo, can you sense it directly, or determine its distance from the Flame Heart Jade's glow?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Lord Feiluo was concise, summoning the Flame Heart Jade before him.  "Set up the formation."</p><p>"Now?"</p><p>The woman hesitated, shifting her cloak.</p><p>"What's to be afraid of? We've been sneaking around for so long, I'm starving!  The more we attract, the better!"  The tall man chuckled, his laughter abruptly ceasing.</p><p>Lord Feiluo coldly glanced at him. "As long as it's not those old fogies from Yun Du Tian, kill them quickly and efficiently."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The three bowed, appearing around Feiluo, extending their hands from beneath their cloaks.  Horrifyingly, except for the woman, the other two had withered, grayish-black hands with long black fingernails emitting a strong corpse poison; they looked like zombies.  The woman's hands, though slender and white, were excessively pale, devoid of any blood color.</p><p>The three simultaneously channeled their energy, green flames appearing in their palms.  The green flames extended into thin threads, interweaving and spreading.</p><p>Beneath the lava river, green and red flames illuminated each other. An extremely complex formation gradually took shape, with Lord Feiluo standing at its central point.</p><p>Just as he was about to act, the Flame Heart Jade flashed brightly, then suddenly went dark.  The four froze, taken aback.</p><p>"Continue!"</p><p>Lord Feiluo's pale hands emerged from his cloak, supporting the Flame Heart Jade.  After a brief pause, the three resumed channeling the green flames, completing the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Fasheng withdrew his spiritual energy, removing his hand from the pillar. The fire subsided.</p><p>"No response…"</p><p>The situation wasn't as Qin Sang had predicted.  He hadn't sensed any other pillars. Either his guess was wrong, or the other formations had been destroyed—the latter being more likely.</p><p>Fasheng shook his head slightly; the remaining remnants weren't worth further effort.</p><p>Unknown to Qin Sang, far away, four individuals continuously attempted various methods to activate the Flame Heart Jade, to no avail.  They remained there for a long time, digging three hundred meters underground, searching inch by inch, yet found nothing.</p><p>…</p><p>Returning to the surface, Fasheng merged with his original body. Qin Sang flew into the air, surveying the landscape below. He began planning.</p><p>This place would serve well as a cultivation ground, ideal for establishing a cave dwelling, but a new formation would need to be created.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully considered the location, believing that with proper use, it could serve as a long-term dwelling.  After examining the remnants of the old formation, he realized the geomantic energy here had been meticulously arranged by a powerful cultivator.  A spirit vein was hidden within the fire vein, making it difficult to detect, yet the spiritual energy was exceptionally abundant.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to keep the copper pillar. The pillar's ability to concentrate fire would provide a suitable habitat for the Vermilion Bird and could be developed into a highly efficient refining chamber—a fortunate discovery.  However, the layout of the fire vein needed modification. He also planned to relocate nearby spirit veins and even directly alter the terrain.  Even without the power to reclaim the sea, a Nascent Soul cultivator could move mountains!</p><p>Such actions would inevitably create a significant disturbance, but the area was sparsely populated; with caution, it should pose no problem.  Here, where fire veins clashed, changes in the landscape were commonplace. Even if someone had previously visited, they wouldn't suspect anything.</p><p>Qin Sang extended a finger, tapping the void.  Points of spiritual light burst forth, condensing into swirling masses of spiritual energy.  He shaped them into various forms, sketching numerous diagrams, only to reject them one by one.  After repeated revisions, a geomantic map materialized before him, encompassing both the surface and subsurface, detailing every fire and spirit vein, even the course of each lava river.</p><p>He vanished in a flash, returning after a brief survey.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A sword light flashed.  The Grey Sparrow Sword soared, its image vanishing into the sky.  The next moment, the sky darkened abruptly, the darkness eclipsing even the ground's fiery glow.  The world's elemental energy surged violently, ascending towards the heavens and transforming into stars.  These were sword stars; Qin Sang was utilizing the Seven Mansions Divination Sword Formation to mask the energy fluctuations.</p><p>The stars shone brilliantly.  The sword formation expanded, its scope limited only by the need to conceal the energy signature. Qin Sang worked freely, channeling the world's elemental energy to sustain the formation, encompassing an area hundreds of miles in radius.</p><p>“That should be enough,” he murmured, ceasing his efforts.</p><p>From outside the formation, nothing appeared amiss. Inside, however, the fire spirits playfully frolicking in the lava felt an instinctive unease as the celestial stars seemed to fixate on them, causing them to panic.  Their perception, however, was completely severed, leaving them to thrash about blindly, unable to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, the four-serpent seal hanging on his chest.  Four serpents, riding the wind and snow, flew in different directions, spewing forth plumes of icy air. The frigid air descended, transforming into ice.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The earth trembled.  Ice mountains plummeted from the heavens, crashing into the lava rivers, damming the flow.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The lava surged.  The ice mountains remained unmoved, the serpents majestic, patrolling the skies.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang spread his hands, palms facing upward.</p><p>“Rumbling!”</p><p>The world's elemental energy convulsed violently, instantly generating a visible spiritual tide.  The tide surged towards Qin Sang from all directions, with the power to destroy the world, yet it calmed immediately upon nearing him. The elemental energy continued to gather, finally condensing into a colossal, mountain-sized palm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The giant palm trembled, then struck the ground.</p><p>“Crash!”</p><p>The ground collapsed.  A massive hole appeared, lava gushing forth in a colossal wave that soared into the sky before slowly receding.  Qin Sang now stood above a newly formed lava lake.</p><p>His work, however, was far from over. The elemental energy flowed according to his movements.  When he pointed eastward, a stream of elemental energy transformed into a giant sword, cleaving the earth.  With a flick of his finger, he drew out an underground fire vein, like pulling a fiery dragon, merging it with another subterranean fire vein before resealing them underground.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang pressed down with his palm, the elemental energy pushing down, causing the ground to tremble and the fissures to close.  When he pointed westward, a riverbed rose, forming a mountain, with two new river channels carved on either side.</p><p>…</p><p>He filled valleys, leveled mountains—all with a flick of his wrist.  As the terrain transformed, spirit and fire veins shifted, imperceptibly converging at the bottom of the lava lake. The sword formation would expand and contract accordingly, masking the changes in energy.</p><p>Qin Sang savored the feeling of controlling the elements. While the spectacle was impressive, his manipulation was crude. True Nascent Soul cultivators would not be so forceful.</p><p>The place was gradually reshaped into Qin Sang's ideal form. He nodded in satisfaction, gazing southward, and beckoned with his right hand.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A thunderous roar.  A towering stone peak rose from the earth, flying through the air before settling before Qin Sang, slowly rotating.  Qin Sang used his hand as a knife, carving the mountain to create his dwelling.  With a few simple touches, he sent it into the heart of the lake.</p><p></p>
