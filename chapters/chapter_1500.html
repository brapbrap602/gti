<h1>Chapter 1491  The Master (6k, extra chapter for the alliance leader Xigua Taro Chek Nao!)</h1><p>Chapter 1491  The Master (6k, extra chapter for the alliance leader Xigua Taro Chek Nao!)</p><p>Two manifestations clashed.</p><p>Qin Sang's previous cautious approach proved effective.</p><p>The stone statue's manifestation only knew one divine ability.</p><p>The external manifestation no longer concealed its strength. All color vanished from its eyes, leaving only crystalline, transparent orbs with a slit opening, from which two sword-like beams of light shot out.</p><p>The beams were almost tangible, forming two icy chains in mid-air.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stone statue's manifestation continued its mechanical attack with cold energy, its divine ability remaining singular.</p><p>The Split-Pupil Ice Chains were among the top three abilities recorded in *Cold Nether Yin Return*.</p><p>The icy chains pierced through the cold energy.</p><p>Seeing the danger, the stone statue's manifestation retreated, its eyes undergoing the same transformation, instantly mimicking the Split-Pupil Ice Chains.</p><p>However, as a mere imitator, losing the initiative proved fatal in this magical battle.</p><p>With a *whoosh*, the icy chains rapidly wrapped around the stone statue's manifestation, forming a cage of chains.</p><p>Simultaneously, the external manifestation quickly completed an incantation, unleashing a torrent of cold energy from the sky to fill the gaps in the icy chains, isolating the stone statue's manifestation from the battlefield.</p><p>With a *boom*, the cage violently shook, cracks appearing on the icy chains as the stone statue's manifestation counterattacked fiercely.</p><p>The external manifestation's aim was only to temporarily restrain the stone statue's manifestation; it didn't press its advantage, turning its attention to the main body and changing its hand seals.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang was very close to the python flag.</p><p>He seemed poised to repeat his earlier tactic, eliminating the stone statue's accomplice first.</p><p>Bronze cauldron, demonic fire, ice fan…</p><p>Attacks came one after another.</p><p>The stone statue instinctively tried to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, a peculiar glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. Without warning, he abruptly changed direction, stepping on the Lotus Flower Seal, deftly avoiding the jade-white light.  He then turned and, surprisingly, charged straight towards the stone statue's main body, directly into its attack.</p><p>The stone statue showed no emotion; its vacant eyes reflected only battle intent.</p><p>Facing Qin Sang's unexpected move, it showed no surprise, the light from its ice fan intensifying, its banner fluttering in the wind.</p><p>The fire dragon and ice dragon entangled, roaring to the heavens, creating a terrifying spectacle, aiming to engulf Qin Sang.</p><p>With a *crackle*, a faint blue light appeared in front of Qin Sang, instantly transforming into a thick, crystal-clear ice mirror.</p><p>Another divine ability of the external manifestation—the Xuan Ice Mirror!</p><p>This ability was simple yet incredibly strong.</p><p>With a *boom*, the stone statue's attack struck the Xuan Ice Mirror head-on.</p><p>Immediately, flames and cold energy flew everywhere, interspersed with fragments of the Xuan Ice Mirror, creating chaos on the platform.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, using the Sky-Eye Butterfly to see through the energy currents.  He moved like smoke, weaving through them and swiftly closing in on the stone statue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the stone statue imitated the Lotus Flower Seal, its movements as subtle and unpredictable as Qin Sang's.  While moving, it aimed the bronze cauldron atop its head at Qin Sang, unleashing consecutive beams of green light.</p><p>Unable to get close, Qin Sang showed no anxiety.  His eyes flashed, and he suddenly pointed at the stone statue.</p><p>With a *crack*, a thunderbolt descended!</p><p>With a *clang*, the summoning-thunder technique struck the bronze cauldron directly.</p><p>Under the onslaught of the violent thunder, the bronze cauldron was sent flying. The stone statue below stumbled, nearly falling, looking utterly disheveled.</p><p>However, the stone statue was still far from seriously injured. It instantly pointed a finger back at Qin Sang.</p><p>With a *crack*, another thunderbolt appeared—it had learned the summoning-thunder technique as well.</p><p>The next moment, two bolts of lightning met in mid-air.</p><p>The instant the thunderbolt descended, Qin Sang activated his long-prepared Thunder Escape technique, successfully avoiding the attack unscathed.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>On another platform,</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Yue fought the stone statue, growing increasingly apprehensive. Realizing he couldn't defeat it quickly, he, like Qin Sang, quickly analyzed the nature of the trial.</p><p>Without hesitation, he patted his pouch, releasing a palm-sized gourd—his trump card, ready to surprise everyone!</p><p>At that moment, he saw the stone statue make a strange move, raising a finger towards him.</p><p>Yue froze, suddenly sensing danger, a warning flaring in his heart.</p><p>He didn't hesitate, quickly brushing his head, white energy erupting from his Baihui acupoint, transforming into a giant hand.</p><p>With a *boom*, the thunderbolt struck the giant hand, shattering it and returning it to white energy.</p><p>Yue trembled, feeling a massive blow, slamming him against the platform, sending him reeling backward. His entire body went numb, his figure utterly disheveled.</p><p>A flash of light, and the stone statue, transformed by lightning, moved with terrifying speed, closing the distance instantly before Yue could react.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Black spiritual flames engulfed him.</p><p>Yue’s face turned ashen.  He was a prodigy, having successfully formed his golden core after only a decade of seclusion.  High expectations were placed upon him. Years of solitary cultivation in the Heavenly Mountains, undisturbed, allowed him to break through again within a century.</p><p>However, this seclusion had left him lacking in experience.  While Heavenly Mountain’s experts had sparred with him, these encounters never posed a life-threatening risk.  Furthermore, the Heavenly Mountains lacked any truly powerful cultivators.</p><p>Now, facing lightning techniques, demonic fire, and lightning escape, a sense of frantic confusion, absent for years, overwhelmed Yue.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The black flames swept across.  The stone statue stopped abruptly. All the magical treasures and supernatural powers, along with their accompanying phenomena, vanished as if they'd never existed.  The spot where Yue had stood was empty.</p><p>Only a curse remained.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>…</p><p>At the archway exit.</p><p>A streak of light shot from the deep fog, followed by Yue, hurled out.</p><p>He took a deep breath, calming his chaotic breath. After a thorough check, he confirmed that he hadn't suffered serious injuries.  At the last moment, just as the statue’s final blow was about to land, he had been teleported away.</p><p>Glaring resentfully at the fog, a hint of frustration crossed Yue's face. Even as a genius with unparalleled cultivation speed within the Xuan Tian Palace, he was unwilling to miss any chance for improvement.  But he was outmatched, leaving him helpless.</p><p>Then, Yue sensed an item within his storage pouch—a token—reacting. He remembered the instructions from Master Shang and reached for it, but paused, sensing something.  He glanced at the nearby ruins of an ancient temple, snorted, and flew away.</p><p>Shortly after his departure, a white light flickered within the ruins, revealing two figures—a man and a woman, both in white robes, with an ethereal aura.</p><p>"He noticed us!  As expected of Xuan Tian Palace's once-in-a-millennium genius; he easily saw through my Thousand Illusions Folding Mirror."</p><p>A mirror with an uneven surface floated before the woman. Watching Yue fly away, admiration flashed in her eyes.</p><p>"But even a genius is just another pawn, right? Besides, you didn’t use the artifact to its full potential, Rain. This trial was too unique; its true power couldn't be unleashed. We were also forced to separate, rendering our plan to work together useless…"</p><p>The man shared Yue’s frustration, his tone tinged with resignation.</p><p>As he spoke, he began to cough violently, his breath turning ragged.</p><p>The woman gasped, “Zhang… what's wrong?”</p><p>"It's nothing!"</p><p>The man waved it off, a wry smile on his face.  “To seize this opportunity, I forced myself to use forbidden techniques, gaining power without true understanding.  My cultivation will fall back to early Golden Core stage; I’ll need decades of quiet cultivation to recover.  Such a waste!”</p><p>This was common in Xuan Tian Palace.  Before the sacred grounds opened, each sect had three hundred years of preparation.  Therefore, hasty cultivation-boosting techniques weren’t as valuable or rare.  The woman wasn't surprised, merely sighing.  "I never thought an outsider would be the victor. I wonder why Master Shang didn't show. I heard he also forced a breakthrough, even more aggressively than you, Zhang. Perhaps he left himself vulnerable and gave up, seeing no chance for himself? I considered him and Yue as rivals."</p><p>“Master Shang crashed the wedding; he paved the way for Yue.  Winning twice in the face of ancient restrictions is exceedingly rare. Master Shang giving up is understandable.  With the demonic invasion and the sacred grounds in chaos, they’re needed for strategy and planning."</p><p>The man pondered.</p><p>"Did you forget about him, Zhang?"</p><p>The woman gestured towards the washing pool. "He’s an outsider, equally suppressed."</p><p>The man said meaningfully, "Rain, haven't you guessed his identity?"</p><p>"His identity?" The woman was taken aback.</p><p>"There’s a rumor in the sect.  Ten years ago, a sacred artifact was missing for a while.  The Grand Elder and other elders retrieved it, but the process was far from smooth. They supposedly encountered a mysterious expert, a mid-Golden Core cultivator whose strength rivaled that of Grand Masters.  The elders were humiliated, forced to make a deal to get the artifact back. I've hinted around with Elder Lan, and he didn't deny it.</p><p>Later, I specifically gathered some information about the Wanmo Assembly.  That person used a type of black demonic fire..."</p><p>The man paused, then sneered, "When did mid-Nascent Soul cultivators become so common? Two appearing one after another? The elders must have suspected something, but it involved one of the four main branches and the Grand Elder—the stakes were too high, and it would expose the Elder Council's failure to protect the sacred artifact, so they all remained silent."</p><p>The woman's surprise deepened. She sighed, "Facing such an opponent, we didn't lose unfairly. However, whether that wedding was real or fake, this person's connection to Xuan Tian Palace is undeniable. With him around, he might be the key to the sect overcoming this crisis."</p><p>The two fell silent, gazing at the archway for a moment before leaving together.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the white mist.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his arm, putting away the demonic banner.</p><p>He was alone on the platform.  The stone statue had just gained new abilities, greatly increasing its power, and Qin Sang had been in a fierce battle. However, after a few exchanges, the statue stopped moving.</p><p>A smile touched Qin Sang's lips.  Just as he expected, the others had been eliminated.</p><p>A gentle force appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He ceased resisting and was gently pushed off the platform, into the white mist.</p><p>After a short while, his feet landed on solid ground.</p><p>Fairy mist swirled ahead, and a faint golden light emanated from within the mist.  Within the golden light was the shadow of a strange spirit tree.</p><p>It was a type of spirit tree Qin Sang had never seen before. Facing the shadow, he felt the golden light bathe his entire body, penetrating his mind. His breath immediately calmed, his true essence becoming still as water, flowing gently through his meridians.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to hear the sound of his true essence flowing.</p><p>His eyes shone with wonder, and he subconsciously walked forward.</p><p>As he approached, the shadow and golden light suddenly disappeared, as if everything before had been an illusion.</p><p>He stopped, experiencing the feeling from before, and then noticed a clear spring at the base of where the shadow had been, the water so pure it seemed nonexistent.</p><p>"This is the Cleansing Pool?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard Liuli describe it, but seeing it with his own eyes was still surprising. The Cleansing Pool was very small; one person could easily fill it.</p><p>Without hesitation, he stepped into the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>Everything around him vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he had entered a vast, unknown world. Five-colored lights filled the void, yet it was incredibly quiet, lulling him towards sleep.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a slight sting.</p><p>He realized that a strange force had enveloped him, ubiquitous, penetrating every pore and entering his body.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated body refinement techniques; his body was strong, and he was indifferent to this level of pain.</p><p>As time passed, the stinging sensation intensified, eventually reaching his meridians, spreading to his dantian, and even touching his Nascent Soul!</p><p>Sweat beaded on Qin Sang's forehead, his body tense.</p><p>He could no longer ignore the intense pain in his body.</p><p>His meridians felt as if they were being cut, his true essence like a bursting dam, wildly impacting everything.</p><p>The source of the flood was his dantian.</p><p>Under the influence of that strange force, Qin Sang's dantian had lost its usual calm, becoming violently turbulent, with waves rising and falling.</p><p>This was just the beginning.</p><p>To Qin Sang's horror, his Nascent Soul also began to lose control.</p><p>That force had somehow invaded his Nascent Soul.</p><p>His Nascent Soul's features twisted, as if he were going mad, emitting a silent roar.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Waves of true essence in his dantian pounded his mind, waves of pain assaulting him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood why the Cleansing Pool required a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. If an early-Nascent Soul cultivator encountered this impact, their Nascent Soul would probably collapse instantly.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was an opportunity, but it also held danger.</p><p>The strange force seemed endless, continuously entering his body.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly was also in Qin Sang's dantian, ignored by the force. She sensed her master's crisis but was powerless, able only to obey his instructions, hiding in a corner, her rapidly fluttering wings showing her anxious state.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists, his expression contorted.</p><p>He forgot everything, focusing all his energy on keeping his Nascent Soul from dissipating.</p><p>Each thread of the strange force that entered was like a needle, a dagger, wreaking havoc within his Nascent Soul. Compared to this, the pain in his meridians and dantian was insignificant.</p><p>His Nascent Soul repeatedly approached the brink of collapse, only to be forcibly pulled back by Qin Sang.</p><p>Again and again, it broke and reformed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he was repeatedly going through the process of forming his Nascent Soul countless times.</p><p>He had become numb, unable to count how many times he had faced the crisis of his Nascent Soul collapsing.</p><p>...</p><p>Just as Qin Sang entered the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>On another floating mountain, the glow of magical artifacts and supernatural powers flickered constantly, accompanied by the roar of battle.  Ice Wind Cave was located on this mountain.</p><p>This place could significantly increase the chances of Golden Core cultivators forming their Nascent Soul, making it one of Xuan Tian Palace's most treasured locations, crucial to the sect's legacy.  Even though it required diverting many people to gather treasures from various places, the Palace Master and Grand Elder still dispatched several Nascent Soul cultivators to protect the disciples entering Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>Sure enough, they encountered rivals.  The other party was led by Dongyang Bo, most of whom, like Dongyang Bo, were Nascent Soul cultivators with no future, using their remaining time to pave the way for their successors.</p><p>The two sides clashed instantly without a word.</p><p>The entrance to Ice Wind Cave was a sheer cliff face.  In the center of the cliff, a swirling blue light continuously rotated. Once the light stabilized, Ice Wind Cave would open!</p><p>Golden Core cultivators were ineligible to join the battle, lining up on both sides of the cliff, glaring at each other but maintaining their composure, wary of making a move, and constantly monitoring the light.  They occasionally glanced at the battlefield ahead.  Due to their insufficient cultivation, they could barely distinguish the figures in the fray, unable to tell which side had the upper hand, leaving them anxiously waiting.</p><p>"Wu Junzi, you dare to stir up trouble at Xuan Tian Palace's sacred site!  Don't you fear I'll destroy your Black Wu Island after I get out?!" a furious shout echoed from the battlefield.</p><p>This was followed by a mocking laugh: "This is orchestrated by the Chaos Demon Elder and the Great Peng Saint. You have the guts to kill them first! I'll wait for you on Black Wu Island. Let's see how capable Xuan Tian Palace is, whether you can sweep across the Boundless Sea! You've monopolized this secret realm for long enough; it's time to share the benefits!"</p><p>This statement immediately drew agreement.</p><p>"What a load of nonsense about a sacred site! This is an unclaimed ancient secret realm, rightfully belonging to the cultivators of the North Sea Three Realms. You shamelessly claim it as your sacred site!"</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>"It's time to give it up!"</p><p>…</p><p>At that moment, the light on the cliff changed, splitting into two, forming a Tai Chi symbol that slowly rotated, gradually revealing an opening in the center.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Hearing Dongyang Bo's voice, Qiu Mu Bai immediately rushed towards the light, followed by a stream of light from the battlefield, clearing a path for him.</p><p>Suddenly, Dongyang Bo's opponent's eyes flickered.  He changed his target, wielding his treasured blade and slashing towards Qiu Mu Bai.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's face changed slightly; he quickly activated his King Kong Zhuo to block the blow for Qiu Mu Bai.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>The King Kong Zhuo's light flickered. Dongyang Bo felt a surge of blood in his throat, which he forcibly suppressed.  However, his opponent noticed his abnormality and laughed: "Decrepit body, yet you dare to be arrogant!"</p><p>This person was quite wary of Dongyang Bo in a one-on-one fight. However, during the exchange, he subtly sensed something was wrong with Dongyang Bo.  A slight probe confirmed his suspicions—Dongyang Bo was merely bluffing!</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai successfully entered the cave, met with a biting cold wind, and heard laughter from behind, his eyes filled with anxiety. He knew his master's current condition.  Since arriving in the North Sea, his master had aged rapidly, especially in the last decade, growing older with each seclusion.  He didn't want to believe it, but he had to accept the reality.  This fierce battle to secure Ice Wind Cave further aggravated his master's condition.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai gritted his teeth, suppressing his worries, and rushed into Ice Wind Cave without looking back.  Every moment he saved could mean a moment of reprieve for his master.</p><p>He came to a fork in the path and randomly chose one. Inside, he found a circular ice platform with an ice silk cushion.  Qiu Mu Bai jumped onto the cushion. As soon as he sat down, the altar vibrated, emitting a blue light that enveloped him.</p><p>…</p><p>An incense stick later, Qiu Mu Bai reappeared at the entrance, his expression a mixture of joy and anxiety.</p><p>"Did you succeed?"  A familiar figure appeared before him.</p><p>"Master!"  Qiu Mu Bai rejoiced, nodding repeatedly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo showed relief, grabbing Qiu Mu Bai's shoulder. "Let's go!"</p><p>Seeing his master was alright, Qiu Mu Bai felt relieved and was about to speak when he saw a figure swiftly pursuing them.  Then, a white light was sent flying by Dongyang Bo – his life-saving treasure, the King Kong Zhuo.</p><p>The next moment, Qiu Mu Bai witnessed an unforgettable sight.  The King Kong Zhuo let out mournful cries and shattered, a blinding white light emitting a destructive aura that captured everyone's attention, stinging Qiu Mu Bai's eyes.</p><p>"Madman!" The pursuer was stunned that Dongyang Bo had self-destructed his life-saving treasure, his face changing drastically as he retreated in a panic.</p><p>Autumn’s eyes were bloodshot. He sensed his master’s life force rapidly fading, yet the hand gripping his shoulder remained as strong as iron, pulling him away from danger.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Two figures landed on a nameless floating mountain.  Dongyang Bo stumbled.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Autumn quickly supported Dongyang Bo, his face etched with worry and regret.</p><p>Dongyang Bo motioned for Autumn to help him sit, his gaze softening.  “I misjudged two people, but thankfully not you. With this opportunity, your Nascent Soul formation should be flawless.”</p><p>“Knowing… I’d rather have forgone this chance,” Autumn gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Don’t be foolish,” Dongyang Bo scolded, his face stern. “You know my condition.  Living nearly three hundred more years is defying fate! Dying in the Ancient Secret Realm isn't a disgrace. After I die, take my belongings and leave the Sacred Land immediately… I have a few things to say.”</p><p>Autumn, his eyes brimming with tears, knelt heavily.  “I vow, I will one day restore Shao Hua Mountain!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo chuckled. “Who said anything about restoring Shao Hua Mountain?”</p><p>Autumn was taken aback.</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed. “I made that vow before your grandmaster, taking the responsibility of the sect upon myself.  I only ever planned for myself once in my life, but…”</p><p>He paused, a look of wistfulness on his face. “Everything in this world is fleeting, only the Dao is eternal! You shouldn’t follow in my footsteps. I order you to focus on your cultivation and pursue the immortal path.  Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng will protect Shao Hua Mountain; it will eventually flourish again.”</p><p>“Brother Qin?”</p><p>Autumn looked up in astonishment.</p><p>He had witnessed the Bronze Hall incident firsthand.  Brother Qin had become a taboo subject at Shao Hua Mountain, Brother Mu confined to Jingyue Peak, and Miss Chen Yan disappeared shortly after leaving Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Autumn was gifted and intelligent. Though he hadn’t witnessed everything, he could guess what had happened, but he pretended not to know.</p><p>Decades ago, Brother Qin had returned, achieving remarkable success and becoming a top expert in the Northern Star Region. His master had then taken him to the far north, leaving in disgrace.</p><p>Autumn had always believed his master was avoiding retribution from Brother Qin.  Now, hearing this, did it mean his master and Brother Qin had reconciled?</p><p>“Once you reach the Yuan Ying stage, you’ll understand that there are no irreconcilable grievances in the world. The path of cultivation isn't always about life and death.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo sounded cryptic, then his eyes lit up with longing. “The ascension to the Purple Micro Palace is an unprecedented event. There must be a reason, but the time isn’t right. I have a feeling the world is entering a new era, and it won’t be long! Perhaps the opportunity to achieve immortality will appear, but sadly I won't see it! You and Qin Sang are fortunate. You shouldn't be bound to the sect, entangled in petty affairs! Remember, focus on your cultivation and wait for the time. Once you’ve achieved great power, then you can give back to the sect!”</p><p>Before he finished, Dongyang Bo smiled at Autumn, his face shedding crystalline fragments. In an instant, he shattered like a mirror, scattering to the wind, leaving behind only a storage pouch.</p><p>“Disciple… obeys!”</p><p>Tears streamed down Autumn’s face as he paid his final respects, grabbed the pouch, and resolutely turned, leaving the Sacred Land as instructed.</p><p>…</p><p>Not long after Autumn left, a faint sigh echoed through the void.</p>
