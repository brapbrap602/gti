<h1>Chapter 705: A Change of Heart</h1><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned, his eyes narrowed as he sized up the gaunt old man.  He coldly asked, "Were you contacting someone outside just now?"</p><p>The gaunt old man's face changed, but he quickly masked it, forcing a laugh. "Friend Qin, what are you saying?  Who?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the gaunt old man, a mocking smile playing on his lips.</p><p>None of the six people present noticed that before entering the cave, he had left his Sky-Eye Butterfly outside.</p><p>After its second metamorphosis, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had gained the ability to turn invisible.  To Qin Sang's surprise, the newly transformed butterfly was already incredibly powerful, able to evade the senses of a Nascent Soul early-stage cultivator.</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that it was his life-bound insect, linked to him, even if the Sky-Eye Butterfly were invisible right in front of him, he wouldn't have noticed unless he specifically searched for it.</p><p>Invisibility was the Sky-Eye Butterfly's only new ability after its transformation. Compared to Foundation Establishment cultivators, Spirit Transformation-stage beasts, or even other second-stage spirit insects, it was undeniably fragile.</p><p>Perhaps because of this fragility, it could even deceive enemies who were significantly stronger, allowing them to survive in the perilous world of cultivation.</p><p>Earlier, outside the cave, Qin Sang used the frost-covered grass to distract the others, then quietly released the Sky-Eye Butterfly.  No one noticed.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Sky-Eye Butterfly hide in a tree.</p><p>Whether it was because of being refined into a life-bound insect and fed with Qin Sang's blood, or because the records of the Yu Ling Sect were incorrect, the Sky-Eye Butterfly was not as fragile as the records indicated; it didn't die at a single touch.</p><p>After its second transformation, its strength had increased significantly.</p><p>Although it couldn't compare to Foundation Establishment cultivators, it could still defeat ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators. Combined with its exceptional concealment ability, it wasn't difficult to survive dangerous situations, so Qin Sang felt comfortable leaving it outside.</p><p>Inside the cave filled with frost, the Sky-Eye Butterfly was useless. Qin Sang dared not release it; it would die instantly upon exposure. It was better to leave it outside to monitor the cave's surroundings.</p><p>In case of any unexpected changes, it could warn him immediately, allowing him to escape in time.</p><p>He and his life-bound insect were connected by blood. Although the Sky-Eye Butterfly wasn't very intelligent, Qin Sang could vaguely sense its thoughts.</p><p>Right now, it was just a thought. As the Sky-Eye Butterfly's cultivation increased, this perception would become clearer and clearer. Eventually, the butterfly would become like an extension of Qin Sang, seeing what he saw.</p><p>Of course, this perception would only be effective within a certain range, and a powerful restriction could potentially sever the connection.</p><p>The cave, however, wasn't as deep as he imagined; the connection between him and the Sky-Eye Butterfly remained.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't trust the short and stout cultivator or the other five. His courage to participate was based on his speed, far exceeding that of other cultivators at his level. He was confident that he could escape even if he encountered danger.</p><p>He had assumed that if anyone turned against him, it would be because of an extremely valuable treasure in the cave, or because the short and stout cultivator had ulterior motives and had been caught red-handed.</p><p>Yet, they had just entered the cave, hadn't even seen the Nascent Soul's cave, and things had already gone wrong.</p><p>The moment they were about to step into the gap in the restriction, the Sky-Eye Butterfly suddenly transmitted a thought: the frost showed unusual fluctuations, and a shadowy figure had rushed out and disappeared.  Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>There were only seven of them in the cave.</p><p>Before entering, they were all wary of each other, unable to leave each other's sight.  The warning restriction was jointly set up by everyone. Unless others also had means similar to the Sky-Eye Butterfly, it would be difficult to make a move under everyone's watchful eyes.</p><p>Only when they were attacked by the restriction and scattered, busy dealing with the black light's impact, did they lose their vigilance.</p><p>If there was an inside man sending signals to those outside, this was the only opportunity.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang immediately wanted to retreat.</p><p>Although they had carefully explored the surrounding waters of the island, the range was limited.</p><p>If someone were lurking further away, receiving the signal and cooperating with the insider, in the narrow cave, the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman would hardly be able to fully exert its power.</p><p>The first person Qin Sang suspected was the short and stout cultivator. Using the Nascent Soul's cave as bait to lure others in, collaborating with accomplices lurking here to kill them – it was entirely plausible.</p><p>However, as the initiator, the short and stout cultivator would be under everyone's watchful eyes.  Even in the midst of the black light, it would be hard for him to escape everyone's attention, posing a great risk of exposure.</p><p>Seeing the gaunt old man lagging behind, Qin Sang immediately suspected him.  During the surge of black light, he'd secretly used the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman to retreat; it was impossible for anyone to have retreated further.</p><p>Qin Sang used a feint, and the gaunt old man, caught off guard, revealed his true colors.</p><p>Was this man an accomplice of the short, stout cultivator, or someone he'd brought along himself?</p><p>It didn't matter!</p><p>The signal had been sent; the ambush party would arrive soon.  Before ascertaining the enemy's strength, he absolutely couldn't allow himself to be trapped in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang made this judgment instantly.</p><p>A cold smile played on Qin Sang's lips.  Noticing the gaunt old man's grip tighten on his bone fan, he attacked without hesitation!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire transformed into a fire dragon, surging towards the old man's face.</p><p>The gaunt old man hadn't expected Qin Sang to strike so decisively.  Startled, he hurriedly swung his bone fan, unleashing a pale beam of light to block the flames.  Then, rapidly changing his hand seals, the bone fan creaked as its ribs extended, transforming into a series of slender, gleaming bone swords.</p><p>Before the transformation was complete, the gaunt old man's face changed drastically. Two dark figures burst forth from the black light flanking him.</p><p>The great battle outside Duoyan Island with the young man in black robes had taught Qin Sang a lesson: even against opponents of the same cultivation level, he shouldn't try to capture them for interrogation, but kill them swiftly and decisively.  He didn't want to experience the power of the Imperial Thunder Talisman again.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa's speed was incredible.  In an instant, it closed in, its ghostly claws multiplying, unleashing a wave of thick corpse energy.</p><p>"Gold Core-level corpse…."</p><p>The gaunt old man was horrified.  Before he could react, the pale light from his bone fan was shattered by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner, forming an array, possessed the power comparable to a mid-grade magic treasure—certainly not something his bone fan could withstand.</p><p>At that moment, the gaunt old man finally realized how terrifying Qin Sang's strength truly was.</p><p>'Crack…'</p><p>With a sharp sound, the bone fan was knocked away by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. The gaunt old man was left wide open.  Seizing the opportunity, the Flying Night Rakshasa unleashed its corpse energy, easily piercing through the old man's protective true energy and plunging into his abdomen, twisting viciously.</p><p>The gaunt old man let out a shrill scream, horrified to see the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire closing in.</p><p>In an instant, he was consumed by flames. Qin Sang quietly took his pouch.</p>
