<h1>Chapter 2223: The Myriad Races of the World</h1><p>“You old geezer, you dared to hit my brother!”</p><p>Luan, seeing Qin Sang spitting blood, thought he’d been beaten by the old beggar.  His eyes blazed, and he swung a fist at the old man.</p><p>His parents, hearing Luan’s shout, rushed in, panicked.</p><p>Just as Luan’s fist was about to land on the old beggar’s face, the courtyard fell silent.  The three froze.</p><p>The old beggar went to Qin Sang, supporting him.  “You reckless young’un, you dared to forcefully cultivate after just receiving the manual.”</p><p>Though he scolded him, his tone held a hint of admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was ashen, his eyes filled with terror. He seemed startled by the old beggar, shrinking back violently. The bamboo scroll fell to the ground.  “What…what did you give me?”</p><p>“You should feel the benefits yourself! If you hadn’t been so audacious, so reckless in absorbing the spiritual energy of the world and forcing the breakthrough of your meridians, you wouldn't have been hurt.  Your illness would have been eight or nine tenths cured instantly.”</p><p>The old beggar shook his head, grasped Qin Sang’s wrist, and transmitted a wisp of true energy into him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s breathing steadied, and color returned to his face.</p><p>It all went as planned, but he still had to act the part of a scared boy. His lips trembled slightly as he whispered, “Who…who are you? What did you do to my parents and brother!”</p><p>“You just asked if I was a god.  Forgotten already?”</p><p>The old beggar smiled.  Clouds rose beneath him, lifting him and Qin Sang gently into the air, until they were level with the mountaintop.</p><p>The mountains, fields, and the city below, with its people like ants, were spread out before them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mouth gaped open. He clung tightly to the old beggar’s sleeve, speechless with astonishment.</p><p>The old beggar stroked his beard, secretly observing his future disciple, immensely pleased.</p><p>“You’re a god?” Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>“I am no true god, merely a cultivator.  Only at the end of cultivation does one reach godhood.”</p><p>The old beggar stood with hands clasped behind his back, gazing at the distant mountains, and said softly, “Of course, in the eyes of the world, we cultivators do possess godlike abilities.”</p><p>Turning to Qin Sang, he spoke frankly, “Will you become my disciple and return to the mountain with me to cultivate?”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to himself, incredulous.  “I can become a god too?”</p><p>“Certainly. Cultivators are just mortals who have stepped onto the path. As long as you have a strong resolve and deep karmic blessings, you will one day achieve godhood. Though that will be a very, very long time from now.”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, seemingly overwhelmed.  After a moment, he blurted out, “But…my family can’t afford a teacher.”</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>The old beggar burst into laughter.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to realize he’d said something foolish, blushing crimson.</p><p>This performance had been rather taxing. Qin Sang had considered every detail, trying to make his words and actions fit a rural boy's demeanor.  He hadn't shown any flaws before the old beggar.</p><p>Naturally, the old beggar was extremely pleased with Qin Sang. Even Qin Sang’s odd remarks were seen as signs of his unique, innocent nature.</p><p>They slowly landed, their master-disciple relationship already established in the heavens.</p><p>The old beggar said, “My fellow cultivators call me Master Tongshen. My sect is on Yuanjing Mountain. Since you’ve agreed to be my disciple, come with me to Yuanjing Mountain to cultivate. I'll give you three days to say goodbye to your family.”</p><p>Qin Sang pleaded, “Master, can you take my parents and brother to Yuanjing Mountain with us?”</p><p>Master Tongshen shook his head firmly.  “The Dao cannot be lightly transmitted. They have no affinity for the immortal arts. Rest assured, disciple, I will ensure they live a life of wealth, health, and longevity.  When you achieve cultivation, you can always come down to visit.”</p><p>Pausing, he patted Qin Sang on the shoulder and sighed, “You must understand, disciple, that the path of cultivation first requires enduring loneliness and separation before you can achieve anything!”</p><p>Master Tongshen then released the restrictions on Qin Sang’s family, explaining the situation.</p><p>His parents and brother were dubious, until Master Tongshen performed a few minor spells, finally believing that Qin Sang had been chosen by a god to be his disciple.</p><p>After the initial elation, learning that Qin Sang would be going far away to cultivate, and would rarely see them for a year, his mother wept softly.</p><p>Master Tongshen offered to help them relocate to a place near Yuanjing Mountain, but they had lived there for generations and didn't want to leave their home. Besides, even if they lived nearby, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to easily come home.</p><p>The Venerable Tongshen offered to buy them a large house in Fengcheng, but they refused to move into the city, accepting only some silver from him.</p><p>These past few days, while the brothers chatted, Qin Sang often heard Luan mention a girl from a family on the east side of the village.  He then urged his parents and older brother to propose marriage, hoping to get his sister-in-law home before he left.</p><p>His parents hesitated for a moment, but that very night, they went to visit the girl’s family with gifts.  It turned out the girl harbored feelings for Luan.</p><p>The girl’s family felt the timing was rushed, but understanding the brothers' situation given Luan’s imminent journey, and seeing the generous dowry, they agreed.  Everything was kept simple; the proposal and wedding were completed in just three days.</p><p>On the third evening, the house was brightly lit and a grand feast was held.  Everyone joyfully sent the newlyweds to their room. The Venerable Tongshen also gave gifts to the newlyweds and Qin Sang's parents.</p><p>The next day, before dawn, the master and disciple left the village without disturbing anyone.</p><p>The moonlight was dim, barely illuminating their path. The village was still asleep. Qin Sang looked back repeatedly, catching sight of the red lanterns hanging at his front door.</p><p>This was partly for the Venerable Tongshen, partly because the few days of worldly life had left a deep impression on Qin Sang.</p><p>"My good disciple," the Venerable Tongshen said, "tell me, how much of the cultivation technique I gave you do you understand?"</p><p>"Yes, Master," Qin Sang replied, after a moment of thought, "I actually haven't understood anything; I just followed what was written..."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully explained, deliberately making several mistakes.  The Venerable Tongshen's smile grew wider. Although his disciple's explanation was naive, his insight was remarkable – something the master had rarely seen!</p><p>At dawn, all was silent. An old man and a young boy walked along the road, alone. As the first light of day broke, they cast long shadows on the ground.</p><p>Occasionally, the master and disciple could be heard speaking. Most of the talking was done by the Venerable Tongshen, with Qin Sang listening.</p><p>The Venerable Tongshen primarily explained the essence of the cultivation technique, but Qin Sang, not needing it, feigned diligent study while his thoughts drifted elsewhere.</p><p>From the Venerable Tongshen's words, Qin Sang realized that the concept of spiritual roots didn't seem to exist in this era. The Venerable Tongshen's understanding of cultivation differed from Qin Sang's own, although the goals were ultimately the same.</p><p>He was eager to find out about the wanted poster – who issued it and why – but knew he couldn't be too hasty. He had to patiently act the part of a devoted student.</p><p>As their conversation deepened, the Venerable Tongshen's surprise grew. His disciple’s understanding was even greater than he imagined.  Qin Sang could not only extrapolate from examples but also offer insightful, seemingly naive questions that hit upon crucial points.  This was all deliberate on Qin Sang's part; he needed to portray himself as an exceptional talent to justify his subsequent rapid advancement in cultivation.</p><p>Finally, the Venerable Tongshen, unable to contain his excitement, took Qin Sang into the air on a cloud, flying towards the mountain gate, eager for Qin Sang to pay respects to the ancestors and be officially registered as a disciple, seemingly afraid that someone might steal his student.</p><p>After these days of interaction, Qin Sang judged that the Venerable Tongshen was at least at the Yuan Ying stage of cultivation.</p><p>"Master, you can fly on clouds, why do you still act as a beggar?" Qin Sang asked, tilting his head, feigning innocence.</p><p>"My cultivation has reached a bottleneck, and I sought enlightenment in the mortal world.  Though I didn’t find a breakthrough, Heaven has been kind, leading me to a good disciple," said the Venerable Tongshen, stroking Qin Sang's head, a smile on his face.</p><p>Qin Sang felt goosebumps rising, but he endured, continuing to ask his master childish questions.</p><p>Though awkward, Qin Sang felt the Venerable Tongshen’s genuine affection. It was a pure master-disciple bond.  Reflecting on his path to immortality, he had never encountered such a master before.  He had always envied the deep bonds he'd witnessed between other masters and disciples, and now, surprisingly, he was experiencing it in this illusory world.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>They sped through the sky, mountains rushing beneath them.</p><p>After flying for some time, Qin Sang noticed the Venerable Tongshen frown. He tapped his cane downwards, summoning a bright green barrier to shield them.</p><p>Then, after looking around, he flew with Qin Sang towards a cave in a cliff face, the barrier sealing the entrance.</p><p>"Master, what's wrong?" Qin Sang asked, though he already suspected.</p><p>"Unpleasant company is approaching," the Venerable Tongshen said, "you’ve met them before."</p><p>A rainbow-like streak suddenly appeared in the sky, passing nonchalantly overhead without noticing them.  This streak, previously seen in Fengcheng, was recognized by Qin Sang as a cultivator's escape technique, leading her to suspect that they delivered the wanted poster.</p><p>Through Master Tongshen's spell, Qin Sang saw the streak's occupant.  Inside was a luxurious palanquin with flowing curtains.  Seated within was a small hawk, wearing a jeweled crown, its black feathers edged with gold.  The hawk, roughly the size of a human head, was plump and languid, enjoying a feast laid before it.</p><p>Two beautiful attendants served the hawk; whether they were human or transformed beasts remained unclear.  Surprisingly, pulling the palanquin were two exceptionally handsome young men, not as drivers, but as mounts, the reins fastened to their bodies.</p><p>Master Tongshen sighed deeply, "Honorable cultivators, forsaking cultivation to serve as a monster's attendants and mounts—shameful!"  Qin Sang understood that this wasn't condemnation, but sorrow.  A deep sorrow that extended far beyond these individuals.</p><p>Recalling ancient texts, Qin Sang noted the scarcity of detailed records on the ancient era.  The fragments hinted at the precarious situation of humanity during the era of the demon tribes' rule.</p><p>"Master, who are they? Is that hawk also a cultivator?" Qin Sang asked, watching the receding streak.</p><p>Master Tongshen countered, "Disciple, do you know why we venerate the divine bird, why even harming a single bird is severely punished?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, "Could it be...?"</p><p>"Indeed!" Master Tongshen's sorrow deepened. "This is Golden Eagle territory. By celestial law, we are all subjects of the Golden Eagle tribe. That hawk is the king, sent to rule this land.  Despite only being at the Lingming stage, I must bow before it.  Otherwise, it can report my disrespect to the Golden Eagle tribe."</p><p>Qin Sang learned that "Lingming stage" is a broad term encompassing the early stages of demon cultivation.</p><p>Master Tongshen's revelation highlighted the vast difference between the present and the past.</p><p>"Master is also afraid of the Golden Eagle tribe?  Are we humans born to be oppressed by them?" Qin Sang exclaimed indignantly.</p><p>Master Tongshen showed relief, having feared his disciple's ingrained reverence for the divine bird.  He aimed to reveal the harsh realities of human existence, saying somberly, "Not just the Golden Eagles, any tribe can oppress us.  Humans are the lowest.  Living in Golden Eagle territory is fortunate, as they are vassals of the Phoenix tribe.  The Phoenix tribe, supposedly born to embody Heaven's Mandate, emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, propriety, humanity, and trustworthiness, teaching these virtues regardless of race.  At least under Phoenix rule, humans can live normal lives.  Those in other territories face worse conditions than slavery, some even raised as food, hunted mercilessly, living in constant fear."</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  Humanity's plight was far worse than the records suggested.  She understood the veneration of the Jade Emperor.</p><p>"It wasn't always this way.  The deities treated all beings equally.  Then they all disappeared, leading to the current situation where tribes vie for power, usurping divine positions."</p><p>Master Tongshen sighed. "Other tribes target us because of the Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p>Qin Sang's interest piqued, "Heavenly Tribulation?"</p><p>Master Tongshen nodded.  "You'll learn.  Cultivators, upon reaching certain realms, disrupt the natural order.  They face celestial punishment, even random lightning strikes. But other tribes face golden lightning, while humans face green—making us outcasts."</p>
