<h1>Chapter 416 Blood Essence</h1><p>“Blood Essence!”</p><p>As the auction drew to a close, Mr. Kan raised his hands, presenting a crimson, round object resembling the heart of some monstrous beast. It pulsed rhythmically, swaying in his palms with a sickening, viscous quality.</p><p>Despite its unsettling appearance, the mere mention of its name ignited fervor in the eyes of many, sparking hushed whispers throughout the hall.</p><p>“Actual Blood Essence!”</p><p>“It's Mr. Kan himself; it must be real! Not just Blood Essence, but even better treasures to come!”</p><p>“I hear Blood Essence is a miraculous healing medicine…”</p><p>…</p><p>Mr. Kan, a knowing smile playing on his lips, allowed the murmurs to ripple through the crowd before announcing, “Blood Essence, the quintessence of the Dragonblood Wood.  For every ten thousand Dragonblood Woods, perhaps only one might yield a Blood Essence at its core—a true wonder of the world! It's a peerless healing remedy, effective upon refinement. I trust I need not elaborate…”</p><p>He paused, his voice subtly shifting. His gaze had fallen upon a mysterious cultivator in the corner of the hall.  A late-stage Foundation Establishment expert, the figure had sat motionless and seemingly disinterested throughout the auction.  Mr. Kan had nearly given up hope, but now the cultivator sat up abruptly, a pair of eyes seeming to pierce the darkness of their robe, fixated on the Blood Essence.</p><p>Was this person injured? Drawn by the Blood Essence's healing properties? Mr. Kan pondered, mentally reviewing his own collection of healing elixirs. Whether to offer them to cultivate a relationship with this enigmatic figure required careful consideration.</p><p>“Starting bid: one thousand low-grade spirit stones! Each increment must be no less than one hundred!”</p><p>Mr. Kan's words had barely faded when a raspy, sharp voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Four thousand!”</p><p>The bidders who were preparing their offers were taken aback, turning to scrutinize the shadowed figure in the corner. The robed figure remained seated, unshaken by the weight of countless gazes, displaying remarkable composure.</p><p>Was this sudden threefold increase a bluff or a sign of unwavering determination?</p><p>Mr. Kan's eyes flickered with surprise. He hadn't expected such an aggressive opening bid, confirming the cultivator's intense desire for the Blood Essence.</p><p>As the atmosphere cooled, Mr. Kan prepared to intervene, but another voice rang out.</p><p>“Six thousand low-grade spirit stones.”</p><p>This voice was refined, its tone far gentler, yet its impact was no less significant.</p><p>Another bold move! An immediate two thousand spirit stone increase!</p><p>The crowd’s attention shifted again, locating the source—a figure clad in silver robes, their face concealed by a hood.</p><p>Mr. Kan was taken aback. He had assessed everyone in the hall, and this silver-robed individual had been inconspicuous, bidding only a few times on lower-value items.  He hadn't anticipated such a substantial bid.</p><p>He knew he'd misjudged another participant, yet he was delighted. Such competitive bidding was precisely what he desired. If these two were evenly matched, it would drive the price sky high.</p><p>His hopes were quickly realized.</p><p>The robed figure turned to fix the silver-clad individual with a sharp stare, then stated in a firm voice, “Seven thousand!”</p><p>“Eight thousand!”</p><p>The silver-robed figure leaned back, not even turning, their calm tone suggesting an equally composed expression beneath the hood.</p><p>“Nine thousand!”</p><p>“Ten thousand!”</p><p>…</p><p>Silence fell upon the hall, even the upper boxes remained quiet, their occupants watching the unfolding drama.  Ten thousand spirit stones was already a high price for Blood Essence.  With both bidders displaying unwavering resolve, the price was bound to climb even higher, deterring others from entering the fray.</p><p>Driven by the silver-robed figure's relentless pursuit, the robed figure seemed to be losing their composure. A chilling chuckle escaped their lips. “Fellow Daoist, with your mere early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, can you truly afford ten thousand spirit stones?  Mr. Kan, I believe we should verify this individual's qualifications.”</p><p>Mr. Kan shared the same suspicion, but before he could act, the robed figure forced his hand. He turned to the silver-robed cultivator, his tone inquiring.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, what do you say to this…?”</p><p>The silver-robed figure chuckled, unfazed, and tossed a storage pouch to Mr. Kan. With arms crossed, they said calmly, "Though my cultivation is modest, I possess some savings. Please, Mr. Kan, examine it. However, scrutinizing only me seems unfair. Shouldn't Mr. Kan apply the same standard to everyone?"</p><p>The robed figure scoffed, "You speak of things beyond your comprehension! A mere ten thousand spirit stones is nothing to someone of my stature!"</p><p>Mr. Kan paused, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly. He glanced at the robed figure, unsure if this was arrogance born of their cultivation or a deliberate attempt to intimidate through revealing their level.</p><p>His mind racing, Mr. Kan returned the storage pouch to the silver-robed cultivator, explaining, "I've verified, Fellow Daoist. Your funds are sufficient.  You may not be aware, but this senior is a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, possessing a token and ample spirit stones, as I've already confirmed.  If you have no further concerns, please continue."</p><p>“A late-stage Foundation Establishment senior! My apologies! My deepest apologies!”</p><p>Despite their words, the silver-robed figure’s tone lacked any genuine respect, not even bothering to glance at the robed figure.  They said flatly, “Unfortunately, I desperately require this Blood Essence to save a life.  I cannot relinquish it to Senior…”</p><p>The robed figure roared, "Insolent fool!  Do you think I need you to yield? Ten thousand one hundred!"</p><p>“Ten thousand one hundred and fifty!”</p><p>Though their bids decreased in increment, the price swiftly climbed to fourteen thousand spirit stones. A few others who had considered participating now withdrew, leaving the two to their relentless back-and-forth.</p><p>“Fourteen thousand five hundred!”</p><p>This price seemed to pain the robed figure. Their breathing grew heavy, their voice strained.  Those seated nearby edged away, wary of any unpredictable outburst.</p><p>The silver-robed figure spoke calmly, “Fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones!”</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>Enraged, the robed figure unleashed their late-stage Foundation Establishment aura, a wave of pressure directed at the silver-robed cultivator.  Those caught in its path, particularly a few Qi Refining cultivators, were paralyzed with fear, collapsing onto the floor.</p><p>Panic erupted in the hall, filled with screams and cries.</p><p>Mr. Kan's face paled. He hadn't expected such a blatant disregard for decorum.  Unable to accept defeat gracefully, the cultivator had resorted to violence. He shouted urgently, "Activate the formation!"</p>
