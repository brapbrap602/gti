<h1>Chapter 1741: The Young Spirit</h1><p>A child's voice is naturally shrill; a scream could pierce eardrums.</p><p>If the ship's cabin didn't have a magical barrier isolating the inside and outside, the sound would have spread, and anyone who heard it might suspect Qin Sang of having some strange quirk.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly watched the Sun God Tree, suddenly feeling something was amiss.  The cries seemed to gradually include whimpering, with distinct sobs.</p><p>He looked at the Kirin Source Seed in his hand, then at the Sun God Tree, his expression strange, speechless for a moment, not knowing what to say.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit was heartbroken.</p><p>It never imagined that Qin Sang hadn't refined the Kirin Source Seed into his body.</p><p>But the Vermillion Bird spirit couldn't understand how Qin Sang had cultivated the *Fire Seed Lotus* to such a high level without using the Kirin Source Seed.</p><p>This Kirin, using secret techniques to set traps and harm people without a trace, was certainly no benevolent being.</p><p>The Kirin passed down the *Fire Seed Lotus* to revive the Source Seed, so it must have left a backdoor in the secret technique, trying every means to guide cultivators into refining the Kirin Source Seed; otherwise, wouldn't it be a wasted effort, letting others benefit for nothing?</p><p>From this, it can be inferred that even if a cultivator can enter the path without the Kirin Source Seed, they will encounter numerous difficulties at a certain level.</p><p>Worse, it could lead cultivators astray, causing them to burn themselves out or explode and die.</p><p>Therefore, although the Kirin aura in the fire lotus that Qin Sang cultivated was extremely thin, the Vermillion Bird spirit had never suspected anything, assuming the source seed was simply dormant for too long, its spirit dimmed.</p><p>It regretted its actions immensely.</p><p>According to its original plan, it should have waited a while longer, until the Kirin Source Seed was deeply rooted and the crisis imminent, making it easier to control Qin Sang.</p><p>By then, if the aura of the fire lotus still hadn't changed, it would definitely have noticed something abnormal and become wary.</p><p>Yet a True Feather of the Sky Phoenix unexpectedly appeared, highly beneficial to it, and it couldn't resist the temptation, appearing prematurely.</p><p>Without the threat of possession, how could it force Qin Sang to submit and have him faithfully serve it?</p><p>And to its fury, its method for extracting the seed's essence had been stolen.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit grew more and more heartbroken, whimpering and crying, eventually wailing uncontrollably, to the point that it was hard to tell which divine bird was crying.</p><p>"Are you done crying?"</p><p>Qin Sang listened for a while, then said coldly.</p><p>"Not… uh…"</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit seemed to feel ashamed, becoming angry and angrily accusing, "You tricked me with the secret method!"</p><p>"If you weren't ill-intentioned, and had warned me early about the hidden danger in this technique, helping me avoid peril, I would certainly be grateful and respectfully treat you. What requests you might have, I would have readily fulfilled.  Why did it have to come to this?"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, his gaze unfriendly toward the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spirit fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang played with the Kirin Source Seed in his hand, sizing up the nine divine birds, and asked calmly, "Do you still want the Kirin's essence?"</p><p>"Wh… what do you want to do?" The Vermillion Bird spirit warily asked back, but its tone couldn't hide its eagerness.</p><p>Knowing its thoughts, Qin Sang smiled faintly. He had naturally considered this carefully.</p><p>Based on what the Vermillion Bird spirit said, it had a way to tame the phoenix true fire within the Sky Phoenix feather.  Having it tame it first, then refining it himself should be easier than directly extracting the phoenix true fire from the Sky Phoenix feather, greatly benefiting his cultivation of the *Fire Seed Lotus*.</p><p>Although this technique was related to the Kirin, he didn't need the Kirin Source Seed to cultivate it.  He felt its potential was huge, didn't sense any hidden dangers for now, and didn't plan to abandon it.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was also very interested in the Kirin Source Seed.</p><p>If he could completely extract the essence within the Source Seed and use it for himself, his spirit would greatly increase, his strength would rise, and he would have a better chance when entering the Netherworld later.</p><p>At his level, it was difficult to make significant progress in this world.  When the ascension path opens, unless a Nascent Soul cultivator has junior disciples to burden them, they usually go east to cultivate in seclusion for a period of time.</p><p>The Kirin Source Seed was undoubtedly an opportunity.</p><p>But seizing this opportunity wouldn't be easy; it certainly wasn't as simple as the Vermillion Bird spirit claimed.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to extract the essence of the Kirin Source Seed, but didn't want to cause any accidents that would awaken the Kirin Source Seed within him, even though he wasn't afraid of possession.</p><p>He didn't have complete confidence just relying on this secret method. To be safe, he might need the Vermillion Bird spirit's help if necessary.</p><p>After several probes, the Vermillion Bird spirit, carried away by its elation, had revealed a lot.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell that although the Vermillion Bird spirit wasn't inherently good, it wasn't vicious either; it was simply somewhat naive.</p><p>If it were someone else, controlling their life, they would have demanded whatever they wanted, not like the Vermillion Bird spirit, allowing him to bargain and offering generous conditions.</p><p>However, this was just a judgment based on his brief exchange with the Vermilion Bird spirit; he needed to learn more about its background.</p><p>“Have you forgotten the oath I just swore?”</p><p>Qin Sang held the Qilin seed aloft, smiling, “Whether I’ve been possessed or not doesn't affect the oath. I alone cannot be sure of finding the Qilin’s true source, nor do I want my secret to be discovered and leaked. Cooperating with you is a good option.  Unfortunately, I am human; I don’t know if I can refine the Qilin’s true source. If it's incompatible with me, who else could it be for?”</p><p>The nine divine birds' eyes suddenly lit up, their fiery light shimmering with brilliance. “Is that true?”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit wasn’t entirely foolish.  There’s no such thing as a free lunch. It hesitated, “What do you want me to do?”</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his fingers, grasping the Qilin seed in his hand, and said solemnly, “I wish to extract the essence of the Qilin seed and refine the Phoenix’s True Fire. I fear I might not be able to do it alone, and hope you will lend me your full assistance.”</p><p>Hearing this, the Vermilion Bird spirit wished it could incinerate Qin Sang with its South Ming Li Fire. Qin Sang was even more unreasonable, wanting it to work for free, yet it was powerless against him.</p><p>Qin Sang also understood the principle of "a hungry soldier is a fighting soldier." He couldn't keep dangling the vague promise of the Qilin’s true source, so he added, “The Qilin seed and the Sky Phoenix’s True Feather are rightfully mine.  In recognition of your help in revealing the secrets of these treasures,  I will share a portion with you if you honestly assist me.”</p><p>This was similar to its previous two conditions, but more acceptable.</p><p>Thinking back to its own boastful behavior not long ago, the Vermilion Bird spirit was ashamed and angry.</p><p>Before it could respond, Qin Sang abruptly changed his tone, coldly stating, “I can overlook your attempt at blackmail, and these conditions are no harsher than your previous demands. However, the condition is that you must prove your trustworthiness to me; otherwise, I will eliminate this threat! Tell me your origins…”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit remained silent for a long time, finally speaking, and revealing its history.</p><p>Listening to its story, it was more accurate to call it a Vermilion Bird fledgling rather than a spirit.</p><p>It turned out that when he collected the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather, the Vermilion Bird fledgling hadn’t yet been born. It gradually regained its intelligence beside him, within the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The fledgling itself couldn’t say exactly when, only that it seemed to be able to perceive its surroundings for a long time, but had been in a daze, unaware of the meaning of what it perceived, unaware of day and night.</p><p>It didn’t know when it suddenly realized that it seemed to have regained its intelligence. Looking back, the past was hazy and confused, seeming both real and unreal, like a long dream.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird fledgling suspected that its spirit had never truly been lost, but had been scattered, only awakening now.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled where he found the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather; it felt like an alchemic furnace, suspecting that its owner had imprisoned the Vermilion Bird spirit, making it constantly supply South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>The furnace had a restriction that could seal the South Ming Li Fire; a piece of green bronze could suppress the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird fledgling had been there for so many years, in a daze, only regaining its intelligence after being taken away from the Purple Micro Palace; this must be related to the restriction in the furnace.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the Vermilion Bird fledgling to recall its past, but it only had a vague memory, being held by the nape of its neck by a hand, and then thrown somewhere. It had been in a daze ever since.</p><p>It couldn't remember what the hand looked like, but it had a deep-seated memory of a certain aura, identifying it as its great enemy.</p><p>“This Vermilion Bird will surely avenge this!”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird fledgling hissed, its tone tinged with resentment.</p><p>It knew its enemy must be incredibly powerful; its fourth condition was to get Qin Sang’s help with revenge.  It was worried about scaring Qin Sang away, so it kept it as a hidden condition.</p><p>Now that the Qilin seed and the Sky Phoenix’s True Feather were gone, revenge seemed a distant prospect.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang almost burst out laughing. No wonder it acted so naive; it had revealed all its secrets so easily.</p><p>He had even called it ‘senior,’ almost being tricked by a fledgling.</p><p>He was lucky he had the jade Buddha; otherwise, this situation would have been very difficult to resolve.  He would have had to obediently serve the Vermilion Bird fledgling, almost like a pet.</p><p>However, though the Vermilion Bird fledgling was immature, certain instincts remained. Upon encountering the Qilin seed and the Sky Phoenix’s True Feather, it instinctively knew they were beneficial to it, as if it innately understood how to control them.  This is why the fledgling believed it had awakened, not been reborn.</p><p>To the naked eye, the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather seemed perfect, each feather smooth and clear.</p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's true feathers, sealed away for an extended period, had been constantly drained of its Southern Ming Blazing Fire and subjected to the Fire Chamber's restrictions.  This had severely damaged them, leaving them unrecognizable and altering the nature of the Southern Ming Blazing Fire, rendering it unlike true Vermilion Bird fire.</p><p>The young Vermilion Bird spirit, newly born, found it could not even control its own wildly raging true fire. It could only carefully tend to and repair the feathers, waiting for their restoration.  Staying within the Sun God Tree was easier; outside, it couldn't even manifest its fire form and could only communicate through the Sun God Bird.</p><p>Therefore, controlling the Sun God Bird wasn't easy; it had no influence over Qin Sang.</p><p>For the young Vermilion Bird to regain its full power, its true feathers were crucial, but their natural restoration was too slow.</p><p>Absorbing the essence of the Qilin Primordial Seed was to strengthen its true spirit, while refining the Phoenix True Fire was to restore the Vermilion Bird feathers. Both were essential.</p><p>Unfortunately, these treasures all belonged to Qin Sang.</p><p>The young Vermilion Bird hesitantly said, "Give me more, and I'll recover faster, helping you sooner."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "Don't get ahead of yourself.  Do you know that ascension in this realm isn't easy? The Heavenly Dao is changing."</p><p>"What Heavenly Dao?" The young Vermilion Bird was confused.</p><p>Seeing its genuine bewilderment, Qin Sang explained the changes affecting the realm and observed its reaction.</p><p>"This… this… when can I get revenge?"</p><p>The nine divine birds stared, their exclamations expressing their stunned disbelief, yet their desire for vengeance remained.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of disappointment. "If you want revenge, you must help me increase my strength.  Ascending to the upper realm is the only way to achieve that."</p><p>This gave him another reason to subdue the young Vermilion Bird.  Even without controlling its feathers, its full assistance would make manipulating the Sun God Birds significantly easier.</p><p>With their coordinated efforts, they might even attempt to challenge the nine divine birds!</p><p>It turned out the Sun God Birds' power wasn't simply additive.  With all nine unleashed, they could likely stand against almost any opponent, if not completely vanquish the Netherworld.</p><p>This return trip was incredibly fruitful!  Not only did he obtain the Taiyi Star Chariot, but he'd also gained this powerful ally.  Once he digested these gains, even without finding the Ascension Platform, he'd be capable of challenging the Netherworld.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit, already leaning towards cooperation due to its dependence on Qin Sang, made a quick decision based on the realm's precarious situation.</p><p>They quickly agreed to terms.</p><p>"Do you remember your former name?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened, his tone gentle.  Seeing the completely crimson Sun God Bird shake its head, he playfully said, "From now on, you'll be called Little Red."</p><p>The nine Sun God Birds raised their necks in unison.</p><p>"I am a Vermilion Bird!"</p><p>Qin Sang finally conceded to addressing it as "Vermilion Bird" to appease it.</p><p>Their negotiations, despite the back-and-forth, were brief.</p><p>Outside the magic vessel, the waters were calm. The Jiao Dragon King's guards, treading the waves, dared not move, vigilantly watching the vessel, though their tense expressions and stiff bodies betrayed their weakened morale.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King was likely already contacting the various clans of the Demon Sea.</p><p>"Friend, you may leave now," Qin Sang transmitted his message.  Discussions among the clans wouldn't be complete without the Phoenix clan.</p><p>The Phoenix King, surprised by Qin Sang's easy dismissal, eyed his transformed form with suspicion.  Hesitantly, she flew out of the magic vessel.  Finding no obstruction, she swiftly disappeared into the sea, heading towards the Jiao Dragon clan's ancestral lands.</p><p>Their deliberations would undoubtedly take time.</p><p>In the cabin, Qin Sang put away the Celestial Phoenix feathers, placing the Sun God Tree before him and holding the transparent lotus seed in his palm.  He asked, "How long will it take to extract the essence of the Qilin Primordial Seed?"</p><p>"Uncertain,"</p><p>the nine Sun God Birds shook their heads.  "You won't let me interfere, so I can't judge. However, I must warn you: when extracting the essence, you must constantly use your divine sense to suppress the Qilin's true spirit and prevent its revival.  During any battle, your divine sense will be limited, hindering your full power."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he was prepared.  In this realm, only ferocious beasts could truly threaten him, and he had plenty of options.</p><p>The impact wasn't a complete inability to use his divine sense; his perception would simply be slightly weaker, the casting of divine sense techniques more difficult, and the manipulation of the fire lotus slightly sluggish.</p><p>He could still use his physical body, poison beads, escape techniques, magical artifacts, and sword formations. It might consume more true energy, but within acceptable limits.</p><p>He'd changed his plans, deciding to return to Central State first to arrange the repair of the Taiyi Star Chariot before heading to the North Sea.</p><p>The journey would be long, and repairing the chariot would take time, but this wouldn't interfere with refining the Qilin Primordial Seed.</p><p>As long as it wasn't excessively long, he could wait.  If it took too long, he could always give some to the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>He wondered what realm he'd reach after absorbing all the essence of the Qilin Primordial Seed.  He was greatly anticipating it, tentatively sending out his divine sense to envelop the seed.</p><p>(End)</p>
