<h1>Chapter 746: The Yin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light</h1><p>The bone flute emitted a bright light, crystal-clear like quartz.</p><p>The light pulsed, indicating a direction.</p><p>Previously, near Huntian Island, when we encountered the second bone flute fragment, there was no such phenomenon.  This sudden change must have a reason.</p><p>If there really is another bone flute fragment nearby, the implication is clear!</p><p>"Can we really collect all the bone flute fragments? Obtain this complete ancient artifact?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help feeling excited.</p><p>After obtaining two bone flute fragments located in different places, Qin Sang had already given up hope.  Unexpectedly, there's a third one in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>"Someone nearby is carrying a bone flute fragment. I don't know if his flute fragment resonates, but based on the last time, the possibility is low."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, peering through the bloody light. His vision was empty, nothing visible except for their figures.</p><p>He tried to move to the left, unsure of the bone flute's range of perception, hoping to approach the cultivator possessing the fragment.</p><p>But then a massive impact struck, hindering Qin Sang and the others.  Qin Sang watched helplessly as the bone flute's light dimmed and disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>"Bang! Bang!"</p><p>On a boundless wasteland, several red figures descended from the sky.  The red light slowly dissipated after they landed.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, stumbled, quickly regained his balance, and looked around. Xiang Yi and the others also landed nearby; all eight of them were present.</p><p>"This is the Qisha Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up; the sky was overcast.</p><p>The magical formation seemed nonexistent; the outer hurricane was easily visible.</p><p>He tapped his foot, rose again, and gazed into the distance, discovering that this place, like the inner hall of the Ziwei Palace, was an extremely vast space, stretching to the horizon.</p><p>In the distance, the sky was filled with clouds and mist of various colors, many signs of hidden realms.</p><p>Within his sight, there were ancient forests, towering trees, strange noises echoing from the woods, very unsettling. Clearly, Qisha Palace is very different from Ziwei Palace; there's wildlife here.</p><p>There were also majestic mountains, like crouching dragons, ancient restrictions floating, and immortal palaces situated amidst them.</p><p>A desolate landscape!</p><p>It seemed that unlike the Heavenly Mountain in Ziwei Palace, there wasn't a clearly identifiable core area in Qisha Palace, but the danger here was certainly no less than Ziwei Palace.</p><p>"The Heavenly Tower..."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept quickly, stopping at the mountains behind.</p><p>There, the peaks towered, the sea of clouds boundless.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower was in that direction, reportedly taller than Qisha Palace's highest peak, but hidden by the cloud sea; its silhouette was invisible from here.</p><p>At this time, glows appeared in various parts of the wasteland, heading in different directions.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, the bone flute remained silent upon arrival.</p><p>This indicated that the cultivator possessing the fragment might have entered before them and left the wasteland.</p><p>The bone flute's range of perception was limited; whether they would encounter that person again was unknown.  If that person perished in Qisha Palace or vanished after leaving, it was highly likely they would never complete the bone flute.</p><p>This treasure remained elusive.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>After completing the Merchant Guild's task, he would definitely prioritize the ancient teleportation array; he couldn't search for this person everywhere, unless the teleportation array was very easy to find.</p><p>The priorities were self-evident.</p><p>He could only put the bone flute out of his mind for now.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, are you all unharmed?"</p><p>Xiang Yi looked at each person with concern in his tone.</p><p>The sword-bearing youth and Cui Ji seemed to have encountered an accident, their breathing slightly ragged. They were seated, recovering. The others were in relatively good condition.</p><p>Although protected by the jade pendant's bloody light, everyone was still shaken.</p><p>The Liu couple complained, "We consulted a friend who had been to Qisha Palace before. He said that when they entered, the magical formation they encountered in the outer area wasn't nearly as powerful as this time. Our protective bloody light nearly shattered several times; we thought we'd perish here forever."</p><p>Xiang Yi chuckled lightly, "I wonder when your friend entered. It was either when Qisha Palace emerged, or they broke through during a lull in the magical formation. It's definitely different this time. The lull in the magical formation is still a long way off. Forcibly breaking through now, this outcome is already quite fortunate. It is said that the Witch Clan not only dispatched a great witch priest but also paid a tremendous price."</p><p>"Perhaps this is why we humans agreed to let the Wu clan's Nascent Soul cultivators enter the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>The portly man, clad in fine silks now rumpled and dishevelled from repeated impacts by the spirit array, had no time for grooming. Like Qin Sang, he eagerly surveyed the Seven Kills Hall.  He descended from the sky, questioning, "Did the Wu clan receive some news? Is there a treasure of great importance to them in the Seven Kills Hall?  They’ve risked everything to make this journey."</p><p>"I haven't heard anything, Xiang Yi asked. "Only the Wu clan themselves know, I suspect.  Has anyone seen the Chief Shaman go in any particular direction? That might give us a clue."</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>Not only the Chief Shaman, but other Nascent Soul cultivators had already entered.</p><p>The fat man chuckled wryly, "I don't even know what the Chief Shaman looks like."</p><p>Just then, Lady Liu's face paled. She pointed towards the edge of the wasteland and cried out, "What's that?"</p><p>Everyone stared.  An unearthly light, incredibly fast, had appeared seemingly out of nowhere. It shot across the wasteland and vanished into the mountains.</p><p>What was terrifying was that as they saw the light, it seemed to contain countless ferocious ghosts.  Sensing their gaze, they glared back with crimson eyes.</p><p>Except for Qin Sang, everyone was profoundly shaken, experiencing dizziness and nausea.</p><p>In their terror, they quickly averted their gaze, only then escaping the light's effect.</p><p>From such a distance, a single glance had affected them.  Moreover, each person seemed to see different ghostly apparitions.</p><p>Everyone was horrified.</p><p>"The Yin Heavenly Ghost Light!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's face darkened. He identified the light's origin.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The fat man exclaimed, "That's the infamous first divine light of the Canglang Sea, the Demon Lord's unparalleled supernatural power, the Yin Heavenly Ghost Light!  It's said only the Demon Lord's disciples on Extreme Truth Island can cultivate this power."</p><p>"This is no mere disciple of the Demon Lord! A fleeting glimpse nearly overwhelmed our minds. Only the Demon Lord himself could accomplish this!"</p><p>Xiang Yi's expression was grim. "The Demon Lord, like the Chief Shaman, is a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. As one of the few remaining human cultivators of this level, he was said to only appear when the Seven Kills Hall opened on its own.  This time, he's come here with the Chief Shaman… How are you two feeling? We’d best proceed quickly!"</p>
