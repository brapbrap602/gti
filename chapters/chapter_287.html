<h1>Chapter 280: Guiyuan Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang's purpose was to gain Yu Kong's trust, and to do so, the first thing he had to do was display his worth and demonstrate some of his strength, ideally attracting Yu Kong to approach him主动.</p><p>The other purpose was to let Yu Kong and the others know that he was not to be messed with, so that he could avoid being used as a cannon fodder when danger strikes.</p><p>This plan was made by Qin Sang long ago, for if it were up to him, he would never draw this much attention to himself.</p><p>He showed his strength, but not excessively.</p><p>The乌木剑, along with the1000 Machine Sword Formation, was enough to deter them.</p><p>Materials like the Ten Directions阎罗Banner, Jade如意符, and Nine Dragons天辇符 could not be exposed.</p><p>The乌木剑 forced Yan Wu back and flew back with a 'swoosh'. With a flicker, it was immediately recalled into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The round Sword Formation was still circling in the air, and the sword energy was not dispelled until the next moment. However, the sharp sword intent still lingered and filled the air, staying there for a long time.</p><p>Their expressions varied.</p><p>At the moment the乌木剑 appeared, Shangguan Lifeng's eyes lit up and his gaze locked onto it. When Qin Sang recalled it, he shifted his gaze onto Qin Sang, and the thick and strong battle intent in his eyes appeared before it was suppressed.</p><p>"What a great sword!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters shared a glance. Out of respect for the strong, whether it was Xiu Zhiying's indifference or Xiu Zhirui's charming demeanor, both of them subdued a little. They cupped their hands towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"Priest Qingfeng's swordsmanship is divine. I am impressed."</p><p>Only Yan Wu was embarrassed by Qin Sang and had a livid face.</p><p>If he had faced him head-on, Yan Wu might not have been so embarrassed.</p><p>He wanted to salvage his pride, but deep down, he was sure that since this priest dared expose his lifebound soul sword, he likely had means that surpassed soul swords.</p><p>If he rashly went up again, he would be humiliating himself.</p><p>Yan Wu glared at Qin Sang with gloomy eyes and coldly snorted. Without saying anything, he turned and entered his room. After a thud, his door was slammed shut.</p><p>Following that, the Xiu sisters and Shangguan Lifeng also returned to their rooms. After all, they did not really know each other, so there was no need to exchange words.</p><p>Faced with Yan Wu's hatred, Qin Sang's expression remained normal. Yu Kong also acted as if he did not see Yan Wu's action. He cupped his hands and praised, "Priest, what a great sword of yours! And what great swordsmanship! With the assistance of a priest and fellow friends, I have no reason to worry about the big event failing."</p><p>"Priest, do settle down in your room first. Simply remove the seal in your room and you will not be disturbed. You can cultivate in peace." Yu Kong led Qin Sang into an empty room and gave instructions on how to control the seal in the room.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the room and realised that it was narrow and the furnishings were extremely plain. It was especially small, only a quarter the size of a normal room, and there was only a straw cushion.</p><p>Yu Kong explained, "The cave dwelling of the West Wilderness Town is extremely expensive. With the assets of this Yu, I can only afford this small courtyard. The largest room has been given to the Xiu sisters and the others are somewhat cramped, so I hope the priest will not mind."</p><p>"For us cultivators, any place can be a shelter."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head to show that he did not mind. Following that, he asked with some doubt, "Fellow Friend Yu, I heard from the old shopkeeper that you are proficient in an array formation that gives us a more than 90% chance of passing the defensive formation and entering Qiuhong Market Town. I wonder what the name of this array formation is? When can we begin to practice?"</p><p>Yu Kong lightly slapped his forehead and shook his head, chuckling. "If the priest had not mentioned it, I would have nearly forgotten this matter! It must have been because when I saw the priest's high strength, it made this Yu so excited to have the priest's assistance, and this most important matter was almost forgotten by me..."</p><p>Although it was clear that Yu Kong was just acting, an ordinary person would have been complacent, even if they could control themselves.</p><p>This person was really good at winning people over.</p><p>Qin Sang was vigilant and immediately said that he did not dare, "My skills are basic and are far inferior to Fellow Friend Yu's. As long as Fellow Friend Yu does not mind my low strength, I will do my utmost to maintain the array formation and will follow Fellow Friend Yu..."</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly.</p><p>"It may not be clear to the priest, but the old shopkeeper had exaggerated his words somewhat. The array formation of this Yu is called Guiyuan Formation. Its power is not as strong as the old shopkeeper had described, but because this Yu had once entered Qiuhong Market Town, I have some understanding of the defensive formation there, so the chances of success are indeed not little. In addition, this formation requires at least nine people to fully unleash its power. Including the priest, we have six people now. Priest, do not worry. Once we recruit three more people, we can begin to practice."</p><p>Just like the Nine Brilliance Galaxy Formation and the Guiyuan Formation, it required nine people to form the array.</p><p>However, the number 'nine' is extreme, which is normal, Qin Sang nodded, not asking more.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed to be very interested in Qin Sang and didn't rush to leave. Instead, he beat around the bush about Qin Sang's background.</p><p>"I've been active outside Xuanguan Pass all along. Later I heard that an ancient herb garden was found in this place and there were divine pills, so I hurried to get here. I didn't expect there to be so many tricks in Qiuhong Market. If I had known earlier, I would have invited two or three friends to join me to avoid such embarrassment..."</p><p>Qin Sang said, looking regretful.</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed, "I didn't expect the rumor to have spread to Xuanguan Pass?"</p><p>"Fellow Yu also says it's a rumor?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned surprise and asked urgently, "There really are no divine pills in Qiuhong Market?"</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes flickered, and he looked at Qin Sang expressionlessly, saying very determinedly, "It's indeed a rumor. And it happens every time a secret place like Qiuhong Market appears. This time, however, it has spread widely, causing many people to be tricked like you, my friend. If people had said there were a few divine pills in a pagoda or an ancient building in Qiuhong Market, it would have been possible. But the rumor is that there is an undiscovered herb garden, which is impossible to believe for anyone who has entered Qiuhong Market. I don't know what the intentions of the rat spreading this rumor are."</p><p>Nothing could be heard from what Yu Kong said. After he had entered Xihua Town, he had made many inquiries, and most people's answers were similar to what Yu Kong had told him.</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He didn't forget to deal with Yu Kong. He frowned tightly, not saying anything.</p><p>Yu Kong comforted him, "My friend, you don't have to worry. Even if the herb garden is a rumor, there are still many places that hold treasures in Qiuhong Market, including divine pills. I happen to know one or two. If you are interested, we can continue cooperating after entering Qiuhong Market. As for any treasures we find, we can each take what we need and share them fairly. What do you think?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect the effect of the Ebony Sword to be so good that Yu Kong had invited him on the very first day.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to agree, but it would have been inconsistent with the cautious character he had created in front of the old owner, so he had to give up this opportunity. He hesitated on his face.</p><p>"You don't have to rush to give me an answer."</p><p>Yu Kong lifted his foot to go out, saying while walking, "We will still spend a lot of time together. By then, you will know what kind of character I have."</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly relieved and nodded.</p>
