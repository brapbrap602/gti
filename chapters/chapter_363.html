<h1>Chapter 356: Reunion with an Old Friend</h1><p>Suddenly, a voice echoed in the room, “Not yet seventy, how did you ruin your health so badly?”</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>“Guards…”</p><p>A stranger appeared in the room. Madam Wu's face changed dramatically, and she immediately started to shout for the guards, but Wu Chuanzong stopped her.</p><p>She looked at her husband in astonishment and found that her husband, who had long been able to maintain a calm demeanor due to his powerful position, was now full of excitement, with tears shimmering in his eyes!</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong abruptly stood up and, under Madam Wu's shocked gaze, dropped to his knees. “Teacher! Is it you? I can finally see you again before I die!”</p><p>Then, Madam Wu saw a blur before her eyes, and a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>This person looked remarkably young, only in his twenties, but his aura was striking, making it impossible to treat him as a mere youth.</p><p>Madam Wu's jaw dropped, and she stared blankly.</p><p>She suddenly remembered that the person in the portrait looked exactly like this!</p><p>When they parted, he was twenty-one, and Wu Chuanzong was nineteen, both full of youthful vigor.</p><p>Upon his return, he was still youthful, while Wu Chuanzong's hair had turned completely white.</p><p>Seeing Wu Chuanzong's heartfelt actions, Qin Sang felt a warmth in his heart. He gently helped the kneeling Wu Chuanzong up, seeing his face streaked with tears.</p><p>“Get up!”</p><p>Qin Sang was also moved by Wu Chuanzong's emotions. He patted his shoulder lightly, a thousand thoughts swirling in his mind, not knowing where to begin.</p><p>“I heard you are the Grand Tutor, privileged to wear your sword in the imperial court, exempt from formal greetings, not even needing to kneel before the Emperor. Why kneel before a hermit like me…”</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong gripped Qin Sang's arms tightly, declaring resolutely, “Without Teacher, there would be no Chuanzong today! Your kindness is like giving me a second life.  You are my reborn parents, of course I should kneel!”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang finally managed to calm down the extremely agitated Wu Chuanzong.</p><p>The two sat facing each other, and Wu Chuanzong sent his wife to bring tea.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang's youthful face, Wu Chuanzong was genuinely happy for him. “Teacher, have you become an immortal?”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a self-deprecating smile and shook his head. “I can only be considered a cultivator. Only after entering the cultivation world did I realize it’s not a paradise. It’s not as beautiful as imagined, filled with deception, hidden dangers, and open conflict. Cultivators are also humans, dreamers chasing an elusive dream…”</p><p>With Wu Chuanzong's experience, he was not too surprised to hear about the cultivation world from Qin Sang, but merely sighed. “Indeed, the world is like this. However, Teacher, a blessed man like you is destined to transcend.”</p><p>“I hope so.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, his divine sense sweeping over Wu Chuanzong. He frowned. “Your body is covered in injuries. Are these from years of battles? You've exhausted yourself. No matter how high your martial arts skills are, they are useless now. Your true energy has become a burden, draining what little potential you have left. Give me your arm…”</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised to find that Wu Chuanzong was a peak-level martial artist, just a step away from the Innate Realm.</p><p>Given his status and the demands on his time, it was remarkable that he had achieved such a level of martial arts skill, showing his diligence.</p><p>Wu Chuanzong complied, suddenly realizing, “No wonder I feel better for a while after each practice session, but my body gets worse day by day. I thought it was just old age…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, cautiously channeling a trace of spiritual energy into Wu Chuanzong's meridians.</p><p>His advanced age, coupled with his numerous hidden injuries…</p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that Wu Chuanzong's body was nearing its end. Without treatment, he might not have two years left to live. Even with treatment, it had to be done with extreme care, or it could harm him instead.</p><p>At this moment, Madam Wu personally entered with tea. Seeing this scene, her face filled with anticipation and excitement, she quickly slowed her pace, afraid of disturbing Qin Sang, and carefully approached them.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled his spiritual energy, guiding it through Wu Chuanzong's meridians, bit by bit, helping to restore them. It was a pity that Wu Chuanzong's age and physical condition did not allow for more; otherwise, he might have been able to break through to the Innate Realm with this opportunity.</p><p>A full hour passed before Qin Sang finished.</p><p>The tea had gone cold.</p><p>Madam Wu clasped her hands tightly, ignoring her husband's urging gaze, and looked anxiously at Qin Sang, awaiting his verdict.</p><p>“Madam Wu, please sit.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something familiar in Madam Wu's features. He suddenly remembered that she was the girl who was almost assaulted by Wang Liu. Wu Chuanzong had shown kindness, which unexpectedly led to a good marriage.</p><p>“Take this bottle of pills. Divide each pill into three doses and take it three times.  Take three pills in total. This should heal most of your old injuries. However, some damage is irreversible, and you are not young anymore.  Avoid using your true energy in the future. Madam Wu can also take one pill to improve her health and prolong her life…”</p><p>Qin Sang took out a bottle of healing pills, similar in effect to the Water Dew Pills.  The Han family would bestow some health-enhancing pills, but to avoid disrupting the mortal world, their quality was far inferior to the Water Dew Pills.</p><p>Now, these pills were useless to him. They were obtained from the man in the bamboo hat in the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Ground. There were a few left. Fortunately, he had them; otherwise, Wu Chuanzong's mortal body might not be able to withstand the impact of more potent pills.</p><p>“Thank you, Teacher!”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong and his wife rose and bowed.</p><p>After the treatment, Wu Chuanzong already felt much better and was overjoyed.</p><p>“Sit down and talk!”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped Wu Chuanzong and said, “Tell me, how are the others? Old Yue, Bai Jianglan, Water Monkey…”</p><p>Wu Chuanzong handed the jade bottle containing the pills to Madam Wu, who immediately clutched it like a treasure.</p><p>“Old Yue was seriously injured by assassins while saving the late Emperor during the night of the mutiny and later retired.</p><p>“General Bai rose to the position of Commander of the Imperial Guard. He retired due to illness at the age of fifty-eight and resided in the secondary capital, passing away at sixty-seven. The late Emperor, mindful of his service in protecting the throne, showed much favor to his descendants. However, Commander Bai strictly forbade his descendants from joining the army. Many became merchants or officials, and the Bai family prospered.</p><p>“Water Monkey made great contributions after you left and was enfeoffed as the Prince of Ning, guarding your hometown, the former Ning Kingdom, now renamed Jiangzhou Province by the late Emperor.</p><p>“Zhang Wenkui and the others also benefited from your legacy and were highly regarded by the late Emperor, each achieving great things.</p><p>“And the Qin family…”</p><p>Hearing Wu Chuanzong suddenly mention the Qin family, Qin Sang paused but didn't stop him.</p><p>“Your parents and elder brother and his wife all enjoyed peaceful lives and died of old age. I did not reveal your news to them, but they probably guessed something.</p><p>“Your eldest and second brothers each have a son, serving as officials and generals, now holding high positions. They will surely carry forward the Qin family legacy.</p><p>“The descendants of the Qin family are also outstanding individuals with promising futures.”</p><p>After hearing this, Qin Sang sighed, “You’ve worked hard!”</p><p>Having lived in the mortal world, he knew very well how difficult it was for the Qin family, a family with no foundation, to reach this level in just a few decades.</p><p>Without Wu Chuanzong's dedicated support, the Qin family would never have achieved such prominence.</p>
