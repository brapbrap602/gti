<h1>Chapter 1511: Surprisingly Empty (4k)</h1><p>The aura of the Stupa touched the light barrier at the entrance of the Exquisite Pagoda, silently merging with it. Qin Sang and Liuli, enveloped in the aura, passed through and arrived on the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang’s tense nerves relaxed slightly.</p><p>The moment they stepped into the Exquisite Pagoda, the clamor outside was blocked by the light barrier. Inside, the Pagoda was unusually quiet, unaffected by the fluctuating flames.</p><p>As the blinding golden light faded, Qin Sang saw a short corridor ahead, seemingly leading to a hall.</p><p>The corridor's material was the same as the Pagoda's, emitting a jade-like luster, resulting in a vibrant, multicolored passage.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to quickly scan the corridor walls, finding no immediate danger.</p><p>Everything in the corridor seemed normal, even lacking any visible restrictions.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew it couldn't be that simple. The walls concealed something, something he couldn't decipher.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a slight tremor in the Stupa in his palm, his sensing ability heightened.  The target seemed to be not on this level, but higher up, most likely the top of the Pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced upwards, retrieved the Fei Xue Dan he'd taken from the Yin Clan leader, and shared it with Liuli and his clone—every bit of recovery helped. He then went ahead to check for any abnormalities, signaled Liuli to follow, and quickly crossed the corridor, only to be met with a surprising sight.</p><p>The scene before them was utterly unexpected.</p><p>The hall was completely empty.</p><p>There were no treasures, no pills, not even statues or murals.  Any attempt to analyze the origins of the Exquisite Pagoda and the stone tablet space from clues was hopeless.</p><p>At that moment, the Exquisite Pagoda suddenly shook.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back to see chaos outside the light barrier—a wild frenzy.</p><p>The demons, having recovered from the shockwave of flames, were seething.</p><p>After expending so much effort to retrieve the Exquisite Pagoda from the depths of the flames, they found someone else had taken the prize.  How could they accept this?</p><p>To make matters worse, the Exquisite Pagoda had only allowed Qin Sang and Liuli inside, leaving everyone else out. Soon, there would be nothing left for them.</p><p>While Qin Sang possessed powerful artifacts, the demons were numerous. As long as they were cautious, they wouldn’t necessarily be afraid.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang and Liuli became targets, and the demons, united in their anger, launched a furious attack.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda had broken free, and the flames in the circular platform were nearing their end.</p><p>Under the combined assault of the demons, the flames were extinguished one after another. The ring of fire surrounding the Pagoda quickly dissipated, leaving only the light barrier.</p><p>Led by the Great Saint Tian Peng, the demons unleashed their powers, their attacks raining down on the light barrier.</p><p>Tian Peng, now in human form, had a grim expression and piercing gaze, as if trying to see through the barrier and pulverize Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Having the time to take a closer look now, Qin Sang recognized many familiar faces, including his old acquaintance, Bi Fang.</p><p>However, the Demon Elder was nowhere to be seen.  He wondered if the old demon was hiding nearby or recovering from his injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang’s brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>The cloud-based restrictions, the underground bone formations, and the inner spirit fire.</p><p>From the outside in, the power grew stronger.</p><p>But the golden light barrier wasn't as strong as they had imagined. Under the relentless attacks, the golden light began to fade, causing the Exquisite Pagoda to tremble and suggesting a shorter lifespan than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>This was illogical.</p><p>Unpredictability was the norm.</p><p>Unexpected events always came without warning.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu and the others didn't arrive in time, he had to uncover the secrets of the Stupa and the Exquisite Pagoda before the golden light barrier shattered.</p><p>If he could control the Exquisite Pagoda, all problems would be solved!</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang hesitated no longer and dashed towards the staircase.</p><p>Liuli followed closely behind.</p><p>The two quickly ascended within the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The second floor, the third floor, the fourth floor…</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they reached the sixth floor, leaving only the final level.</p><p>The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged bitter smiles. The first six floors had been completely empty!</p><p>They had used their powerful artifacts, angered a multitude of demons, and risked their lives to enter the Exquisite Pagoda, only to find nothing. Who would believe it?</p><p>They could only hope the seventh floor wouldn't disappoint them.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, quickly climbed the stairs, and finally saw something that the first six floors lacked.</p><p>On the seventh floor, in the center, was a round jade platform.</p><p>Three treasures rested on the platform.</p><p>Upon seeing them, Qin Sang's gaze was immediately drawn to the treasure on the left.  A look of surprise, mixed with a degree of astonishment, crossed his face.</p><p>It was a piece of the Slaughter Sword, something Qin Sang knew intimately!</p><p>And not just one piece.</p><p>Two fragments of the Slaughter Sword, joined together!</p><p>Without its spirit, the fragments couldn't perfectly fuse; the crack between them was clearly visible.  Together, the two pieces formed a complete character: 'Earth'.</p><p>"Earth Slaughter…"</p><p>Qin Sang, remembering the 'Slaughter' character on his fragment, murmured to himself, "Is 'Earth Slaughter Sword' its name?"</p><p>The long-sought-after fragments were right before him.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang didn't rush forward.  He stared at them, lost in thought.</p><p>The scene here was drastically different from what he'd witnessed in the Nether Valley!</p><p>The Nether Valley was desolate, permeated with Nether Qi.</p><p>Compared to the Nether Valley, the environment inside the Exquisite Pagoda was remarkably better.</p><p>The single fragment in the Nether Valley had been stuck among loose rocks, as if carelessly thrown there.  These two, however, appeared to have been deliberately and calmly placed.</p><p>Most importantly, where was the cultivation technique?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he scanned the other treasures on the jade platform:</p><p>A long jade box.</p><p>A jade slip.</p><p>Faint green lights, like thin threads, emanated from within the jade box.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the box and turned to the jade slip, beckoning it with a gesture.</p><p>Without incident, the jade slip vibrated and flew into Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual sense, quickly scanning the jade slip's contents.  His surprise grew with each passing moment.  He immediately withdrew his focus, turning to Liuli: "Quickly send a message to Grandmaster Jiang. This place is dangerous; we must evacuate immediately!"</p><p>After reaching the seventh floor, Liuli had remained motionless at the foot of the stairs.  Facing the treasures, her expression remained calm and impassive, her eyes devoid of greed.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, Liuli paused, puzzled.  However, trusting Qin Sang's judgment, she immediately took out the golden toad Grandmaster Jiang had given her and lightly tapped its back.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The toad spat out a pearl.</p><p>Liuli caught it, her lips moving slightly. A white mist appeared within the pearl.</p><p>The mist writhed, rapidly changing form, until finally solidifying into several characters.</p><p>Liuli placed the pearl back into the toad's mouth.  The toad's eye twitched; 'pop!', the pearl shattered, losing its luster, the white characters disappearing without a trace.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang immersed his consciousness in the jade slip again.</p><p>The jade slip contained relatively few characters, but the content was incredibly rich, answering most of Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>After reading the first part, Qin Sang finally understood the whole story!</p><p>The treasures in the Exquisite Pagoda, the seven-story pagodas of the Pure Sea Sect and the Lingzhi Ruyi, the seven-story pagoda of the Xuan Tian Palace...</p><p>All were left behind by Xiao Xiangzi!</p><p>Furthermore, the Xuan Tian Palace sacred site had been discovered by Xiao Xiangzi and the ancestors of several lines of the Xuan Tian Palace; its existence had been previously unknown.</p><p>Upon initially opening the sacred site, Xiao Xiangzi had discovered the stele space.</p><p>After leaving the stele space, he resealed it, repurposing it. This explained why the Xuan Tian Palace was unaware of it.</p><p>The jade slip's contents, written by Xiao Xiangzi, merely outlined the purpose of his arrangements in a very concise manner.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't glean the details, only piecing together a rough outline from his previous findings and conjecture.</p><p>Before Xiao Xiangzi's sudden appearance, the Xuan Tian Palace did not exist. The Hidden Sun Realm, much like the current Crescent Moon Realm, was filled with numerous, independent sects.</p><p>At that time, a legend of an ancient immortal sect circulated in the Hidden Sun Realm. Xiao Xiangzi, greatly interested, summoned various sects.</p><p>With their combined efforts, they actually found the legendary place – the current Xuan Tian Palace sacred site.</p><p>Recognizing the sects' significant contributions, Xiao Xiangzi did not monopolize the sacred site. Instead, he used it as an opportunity to foster alliances among the Hidden Sun Realm sects, establishing the Xuan Tian Palace and allowing them to jointly govern the sacred site.</p><p>His purpose in doing so was consistent with his sealing of the stele space.</p><p>Because, before that, there had been a little-known demonic upheaval in the North Sea, originating from the demon-sealing land beneath the Pure Sea Sect!</p><p>At that time, a demon lord was about to break the seal. Luckily, Xiao Xiangzi, already a Nascent Soul cultivator, stabilized the seal in time, saving the North Sea from demonic calamity.</p><p>But Xiao Xiangzi knew the demon lord's power was terrifying, that the sealing power would weaken over time, and could not last forever. If the demon lord possessed sufficient vitality and didn't die within the seal, it would eventually break free – and he would no longer be there.</p><p>To this end, Xiao Xiangzi made many preparations.</p><p>One of his aims was to pass down Buddhist teachings, ensuring the Jing Hai Sect would forever guard the Demon Seal Land and watch over the seal.</p><p>The Demon Seal Land possesses unique morning and evening bell sounds, greatly beneficial to cultivation, even benefiting Yuan Ying cultivators. It's a treasure land second only to the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds.</p><p>Another of his plans involved this place.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi, upon entering the stele space, discovered its unique spirit array.  If properly utilized, it could serve as a last resort against the demon.</p><p>Of course, the stele space's spirit array couldn't compare to the Demon Seal, otherwise Xiao Xiangzi would have lured the demon there long ago.</p><p>At the time, the demon was resealed, suffering constant torment within the seal, growing weaker over time. When it finally amassed enough power to break the seal, its cultivation would be significantly reduced.</p><p>Then, the North Sea cultivators would have a chance to kill the demon.</p><p>If the demon proved too difficult to subdue, they would lure it to the sacred grounds and reseal it!</p><p>The demon would undoubtedly be cunning; making it walk into a trap would be no easy feat.</p><p>This brings us to the Lingzhi Ruyi the Hun Mo Elder obtained from the Jing Hai Sect – the perfect bait.</p><p>This treasure, an ancient artifact Xiao Xiangzi found in the sacred grounds, is deeply connected to the stele space.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi tested it: once the sacred grounds were activated, a large area of the surrounding sea would react, and the Lingzhi Ruyi would show unusual activity.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi deliberately left the Lingzhi Ruyi in the Jing Hai Sect to tempt the demon into stealing it, then devise a plan to lure it to the South Sea and activate the sacred grounds.</p><p>The Ice Demon Crystal was also crafted by Xiao Xiangzi himself, originally a treasure of the Xuan Tian lineage.</p><p>Even if the Ice Demon Crystal hadn't absorbed sufficient power, it could be used to forcibly open the sacred grounds in an emergency, though it would require a longer recovery period afterward.</p><p>The demon, widely knowledgeable, would recognize the Lingzhi Ruyi's extraordinary origin. Upon discovering such an ancient relic, how could it not be tempted?</p><p>As long as the demon could be lured into the stele space, the spirit array could be controlled, sealing the demon within!</p><p>The array controller is the Futu Pagoda in Qin Sang's possession.</p><p>With the Futu Pagoda, one can enter the Linglong Pagoda and manipulate the spirit array.</p><p>To this end, Xiao Xiangzi painstakingly studied the stele space's array, finding its key elements.</p><p>Fearing the demon might notice anomalies and see through the plan, Xiao Xiangzi didn't dare, nor was he able to, make significant alterations to the array. Refining the Futu Pagoda was his limit.</p><p>Once activated, the array is irreversible; there's only one chance.</p><p>Worried someone might use the Futu Pagoda to eliminate rivals, slaughter fellow cultivators, waste the opportunity, and betray his intentions, Xiao Xiangzi split the Futu Pagoda in two, placing one half in the Xuan Tian Palace and the other in the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had no way of knowing how Xiao Xiangzi explained this to the two sects.</p><p>As it turned out, unforeseen circumstances and too many variables were at play.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace suffered frequent internal strife and external threats. After repeated devastation, it lost many things and forgot its ancestors' instructions.</p><p>Whether the Jing Hai Sect failed to contact the Xuan Tian Palace, received no response, or suffered some unexpected event, the entire sect perished along with the demon.</p><p>The secrets were lost, and the stele space remained sealed.</p><p>Had it not been for the Ghost Mother opening the Jing Hai Sect ruins, seeking a nautical chart and attracting Qin Sang and the Hun Mo Elder, the Lingzhi Ruyi and Futu Pagoda wouldn't have resurfaced.</p><p>It remains unknown when the secrets of this place will be revealed.</p><p>Qin Sang will likely spend a long time confirming the Killing Sword fragment is hidden here. He will also need to find another way to open the stele space, a task that may take years.</p><p>The Killing Sword fragment and the jade box are Xiao Xiangzi's "rewards".</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi wrote in the jade slip that he unexpectedly obtained a fragment, believing it to be a rare and precious relic, yet unable to wield it himself. After searching for a long time, he only found another fragment in the Central Plains, with no further leads.</p><p>He believes other fragments may also be in this world, so he left these two here, hoping future generations would continue the search.</p><p>As for the treasure inside the jade box, it's the Zhenling Incense, renowned to Qin Sang!</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi stated:</p><p>The disciples sent by the two sects, daring to come here with the Futu Pagoda, must be benevolent people concerned for the world, possessing a determination to sacrifice themselves for the demon, ready to die.</p><p>The Zhenling Incense and the relic fragment are your rewards.</p><p>Upon reading this, Qin Sang felt ashamed.</p><p>He feared he would betray Xiao Xiangzi's intentions.</p><p>He couldn't help but thank Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>While the Zhenling Incense is a treasure to others, Qin Sang values the Killing Sword fragment and the contents of the jade slip most.</p><p>The latter half of the jade slip contains the Central Plains nautical chart Qin Sang had long sought, and some Central Plains secrets recorded by Xiao Xiangzi!</p><p>The magnitude of this discovery was enough to excite even Qin Sang.</p><p>Temporarily lacking the time to examine the secrets, he opened his eyes, turned, and looked down towards the Linglong Pagoda entrance.</p><p>The Linglong Pagoda shook more violently, demons frantically attacking the light barrier.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang recalled a fitting phrase, muttering it under his breath, as Liuli watched in astonishment.</p><p>"A vast expanse of white…so clean!"</p>
