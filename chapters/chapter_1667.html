<h1>Chapter 1658: Star Pavilion</h1><p>The great hall was windowless. The shimmering barrier of the Wish-Granting Jewel served as the sole light source, dispelling the darkness and casting dancing shadows across the interior.  Qin Sang maintained a vigilant stance, his eyes scanning the surroundings.  Finding himself alone, he inwardly expressed his confusion.</p><p>Recalling the sudden shift, he was certain the anomaly wasn't of his making. Some unforeseen change must have occurred elsewhere, though he couldn't fathom why he was transported here, and alone at that.</p><p>"What did Zhu Wudao do?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts immediately went to Zhu Wudao. The man possessed the most intimate knowledge of the Formless Immortal Sect.  Considering the time that had passed, Zhu Wudao, unable to wait for the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, should already be within the mountain.</p><p>His gaze swept across the hall. The interior was vast and empty, devoid of ornamentation, save for a two-tiered jade platform in the center, resembling a ceremonial altar.  However, the altar lacked any trace of spiritual light, appearing abandoned.</p><p>He was about to approach the altar to examine its purpose, but hesitated, a flicker of caution in his eyes.  The situation was unclear, and recklessness was unwise. He needed to ascertain his location and find an exit first.</p><p>"No doors…"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  The entire hall was utterly devoid of doors.  Protective restrictions shimmered on the walls, and without even attempting to breach them, he knew it would be no easy feat.  He looked upwards towards the domed ceiling, but found no skylight either.</p><p>A faint tremor emanated from the floor, suggesting the area beyond the hall was far from tranquil. This deepened his perplexity.  It seemed the exit was indeed linked to the altar after all.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed as he neared the altar, preparing for a closer inspection.  Suddenly, a brilliant light erupted, not from the altar itself, but from the other side.  The light filled the hall, then vanished as swiftly as it had appeared.</p><p>Yet, the hall did not plunge back into darkness.  Immediately following, another orb of light blazed forth.</p><p>*Swish! Swish!*</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four orbs of light ignited in succession.  As their brilliance faded, four figures materialized, each radiating a formidable aura no less potent than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Upon seeing their faces, Qin Sang's expression froze, a bitter taste rising in his mouth.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao joining forces with Zhu Wudao was within his expectations. But when had Old Devil Fan entered and aligned himself with them?</p><p>The newcomers were indeed Zhu Wudao and his three companions.</p><p>Qin Sang had crossed paths with two of them before, forging minor grudges in the process. Back then, it hadn't escalated to life-or-death conflict, but now, outnumbered and trapped within this windowless hall, with no apparent escape route, would they not harbor malicious intent?</p><p>Even Qin Sang, with his considerable self-assurance, dared not face four Grand Cultivators alone.</p><p>"Where's the Purple Thunder Patriarch?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, his gaze frantically searching.</p><p>Yet, after the four materialized, no other light appeared.  Could it be that the three Daoist Grand Cultivators weren't on Emperor's Bestowal Mountain?</p><p>Meanwhile, eight eyes locked onto Qin Sang, each pair reflecting a different emotion.</p><p>"The Fire Devil!"</p><p>Su Zinan blurted out, then his face lit up with unrestrained joy. It was as if he had stumbled upon a priceless treasure without even searching.  Upon arriving at the mountain, a grand gift was already presented to him!</p><p>If they could slay the Fire Devil here, they would not only seize the tribulation-transcending treasure but also secure the third host soul for the Demonic Banner!</p><p>Seeing the hall's lack of exits, Su Zinan threw back his head and laughed. "Did you ever imagine you'd meet such an end?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. He'd clashed with Old Man Wu before, ending in a stalemate. Why did Su Zinan harbor such intense hatred towards him?</p><p>Perhaps he blamed him for Yue Fei's death, or perhaps Su Zinan knew what lay hidden within the Water Aspect Master's tomb!</p><p>Old Devil Fan had been observing Qin Sang with a constant smirk. Hearing Su Zinan's laughter, he asked curiously, "Fellow Daoist Su also has a grudge against this fiend?  The heavens have eyes!  Truly, those who commit injustice will meet their demise.  He has walked straight into hell!"</p><p>Killing intent flashed in his eyes.  Dark light swirled in his palm, and nine Shadow Demon Nails lay concealed within his grip.  He vividly remembered the previous encounter outside the Immortal Sect, where three of his Shadow Demon Nails were instantly shattered. Thus, this time, he prepared all nine.</p><p>Su Zinan had been secretly transmitting messages, urging the others to attack. He and Mo Xingdao had a prior pact, but Zhu Wudao and Old Devil Fan's intentions were unfathomable.  Qin Sang possessed the Ice Instrument Divine Disc, a treasure others might not recognize, but Zhu Wudao would undoubtedly discern its value. Su Zinan didn't want the two devils to reap the rewards after a fierce battle.</p><p>Delighted that he'd persuaded Old Devil Fan with little effort, Su Zinan was suddenly startled to see the corners of Qin Sang's mouth curl upwards.  Not only did he display no fear, but a cold smile played upon his lips.</p><p>In the next instant, Qin Sang's hand, resting on the edge of the altar, turned black as Nine Nether Demonic Fire surged forth, unreservedly crashing into the altar!</p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p>Su Zinan's expression shifted drastically.  Black light blazed in his palm, transforming into a black ruler.  The ruler's shadow, devoid of any flourish, tore through the void, aiming for Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's face darkened, and the nine Shadow Demon Nails flew from his hand.</p><p>But Qin Sang was too close to the altar.  Though their reactions were swift, the Demonic Fire was faster.</p><p>The moment the four appeared, Qin Sang had already scanned the altar with his divine sense.  The Formless Immortal Sect, having constructed this hall, wouldn't have left no escape. The key must lie within the altar.  Upon closer inspection, he indeed found a hidden mechanism. The altar was the control point for the hall's restrictions. Furthermore, a powerful force was continuously assaulting the hall from the outside, causing the tremors, destabilizing the altar.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The Demonic Fire poured into the altar.  Runes on the altar flashed brilliantly, and under the onslaught of the Demonic Fire, the restrictions went haywire.</p><p>This was undoubtedly adding insult to injury.  Under the combined internal and external assault, the entire hall vibrated with a deafening hum. The five within felt the ground violently shake beneath their feet, then watched as the altar shattered, leaving behind a blinding white light.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating this, retreated swiftly.  A thunderous crash echoed behind him as a section of the stone wall slammed against the protective barrier of his Wish-Granting Jewel.</p><p>Unnoticed, the hall had begun to collapse. The dome was the first to be ripped away, allowing a torrent of swirling mist to pour in, followed by the surrounding walls.</p><p>Finally, the hall's foundations were torn asunder by the immense force, transforming into a cascading torrent of rubble that was swept into the depths of the swirling mist.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The five reacted quickly, taking to the air before the hall's complete collapse, escaping unharmed.  The only ones affected were Su Zinan and Old Devil Fan, whose attacks were disrupted by the altar's volatile energy, allowing Qin Sang to effortlessly evade them.</p><p>*Whoooosh! Whoooosh!*</p><p>Fierce winds howled as the mist churned and surged.</p><p>The five stood amidst the clouds, their bodies shimmering with protective auras of various colors, evidently having activated their respective defensive treasures to withstand the turbulent currents within the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang remained outnumbered, one against four.  During the standoff, they all silently observed their surroundings.</p><p>Above and below, the swirling mist was omnipresent, limiting their vision.  Above, the silhouette of the divine mountain could faintly be discerned, its towering peaks even more imposing than the mountain vista they had seen earlier.  Seeing this, they realized this was the true Emperor's Bestowal Mountain!</p><p>They were within the mountain's bounds, but still within the confines of the grand formation. The turbulent mist was a consequence of the formation's disruption.</p><p>Though seemingly protracted, these observations occurred within the span of a few heartbeats for cultivators of their caliber.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others showed no immediate haste to ascend the mountain, their eyes still fixed on Qin Sang with predatory intent.</p><p>Zhu Wudao harbored no personal grudge against Qin Sang. After entering the hall, he had been wary of the Daoist cultivators. One reason for gathering allies was to prevent being cornered by them.</p><p>The Daoists had entered Emperor's Bestowal Mountain earlier.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Purple Thunder Patriarch had yet to appear.</p><p>Zhu Wudao felt a slight easing of tension.  He glanced around, then looked at Qin Sang with a curious gaze, wondering about this enigmatic figure. "May I inquire as to Fellow Daoist's esteemed name?  Are you a descendant of the Fire Aspect?  It's a pity that in the Transportation Hall, Fellow Daoist was unwilling to forge a favorable connection.  Otherwise, I could have mediated and resolved the grievances between you all. As long as it's not a blood feud, I believe Fellow Daoist Su and Senior Brother Fan would give me some face..."</p><p>"Why waste words on him! Even without a grudge, it doesn't hurt to eliminate him, one less competitor for the treasure!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan was still smarting from the loss of his nine Shadow Demon Nails, placing the blame squarely on Qin Sang.</p><p>Su Zinan remained silent, the black ruler hovering before him. A delicate net slipped from his sleeve into his hand as he silently chanted incantations.  The Dragon Sinew Net expanded in the air, its size shifting from nearly invisible to capable of ensnaring the heavens themselves!</p><p>The capture of Elder Yanshan's nascent soul was partly due to this net.  The net might not hold Qin Sang indefinitely, but a momentary delay would suffice. Even if Zhu Wudao remained neutral, they still had three against one.  Su Zinan didn't believe they couldn't subdue Qin Sang!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Dragon Sinew Net vanished, replaced by a grid of intersecting lines of light. The grid was about to close.</p><p>A pair of breathtakingly beautiful phoenix wings had materialized behind Qin Sang at some point.  He targeted a point within the swirling mist, then, man and sword united, transformed into a bolt of lightning and shot away!</p><p>A thunderclap echoed from the flat ground.</p><p>"Such incredible speed!"</p><p>Su Zinan and the others were all taken aback, watching helplessly as the lightning bolt pierced through a gap in the net.</p><p>As the lightning passed through the net, a black lotus blossomed at the breach, its core radiating a demonic aura that formed a cage.  However, it only captured a wisp of mist, failing to trap its intended target.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's expression stiffened, then morphed into fury.  His left palm flipped, and the black lotus soared into the air, inverting and showering the area with countless rays of dark light.</p><p>Wherever the black light touched, more black lotuses bloomed.</p><p>In an instant, the sea of mist was transformed into a field of thousands of undulating black lotuses.</p><p>Qin Sang's lightning form plunged into this lotus field. An icy, malevolent aura permeated the surroundings, and black lotuses surrounded him on all sides. No matter how he maneuvered, he couldn't escape.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The black lotuses surged forward, sharp as blades. If caught within their vortex, Qin Sang would be reduced to mincemeat.</p><p>Protected by his shimmering barrier and wielding the Demonic Fire, Qin Sang's aura blazed, incinerating countless black lotuses.</p><p>However, Old Devil Fan's aim was merely to slow Qin Sang, forcing him to divide his attention.  Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao took advantage of the opportunity, flanking him from both sides.</p><p>Just then, a sharp cry rang out from the depths of the mist: "Myriad Illusionary Black Lotus!"</p><p>The voice carried an undeniable chilling intent.</p><p>Hearing it, Zhu Wudao and the others' faces changed.</p><p>Immediately following, a thunder even more awe-inspiring than Qin Sang's lightning resonated from the depths of the mist. Five thunder pythons burst into view, charging into the lotus field, joining forces with Qin Sang's Demonic Fire to clear a path ahead.</p><p>Behind the thunder pythons, two figures emerged from the mist, none other than the two Grand Cultivators of Eight Scenery Mountain.</p><p>"The two Grand Cultivators have finally arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in greeting from afar.</p><p>Upon escaping the collapsing hall, he hadn't worried about his predicament.  His Heavenly Eye divine ability had pierced through the mist, revealing the presence of Purple Thunder Patriarch and Grand Cultivator He Gao. They must have entered earlier, breaching the Jade Pavilion space before the anomaly and entering the mountain, thus avoiding being transported to the hall.</p><p>As for why only the two from Eight Scenery Mountain were present, and not Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang didn't know.  However, with these two present, Zhu Wudao's group wouldn't dare to target him further.</p><p>In the Transportation Hall, he had attacked them, but now he relied on them for his safety. The situation had truly shifted.</p><p>"It's you."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Grand Cultivator He Gao's expression was wary.</p><p>Qin Sang had attacked them earlier, so he didn't have a favorable impression of him.</p><p>"The Transportation Hall incident was a misunderstanding. I apologize to the two Fellow Daoists.  These Formless Immortal Sect remnants deliberately disrupted the formation.  Their intentions are questionable and must be investigated!"</p><p>Qin Sang redirected the blame towards Zhu Wudao, his figure flashing as he landed near the two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>Behind him, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao, hot on his heels, were forced to stop, hesitation evident in their eyes.</p><p>Purple Thunder Patriarch's gaze turned towards Old Devil Fan. "Fellow Daoist Fan is also colluding with the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect?"</p><p>Old Devil Fan chuckled, withdrawing his Myriad Illusionary Black Lotus, and instead, shifted the blame.  "Old geezer, I heard they could activate the Formless Immortal Sect because you deliberately allowed it?"</p><p>The anger on his face had vanished, and Qin Sang was no longer in his sights.</p><p>"After we leave, this poor Daoist will provide you with an explanation," Purple Thunder Patriarch said calmly.</p><p>"No, no, no..." Old Devil Fan shook his head repeatedly. "I don't need an explanation.  You only need to tell me what happened in the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>Purple Thunder Patriarch frowned, knowing he couldn't conceal it any longer. He sighed inwardly and said, "If this poor Daoist knew the details, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths. After this concludes, this poor Daoist will collaborate with Sweet Dew Zen Monastery to open the Immortal Palace. At that time, we will invite your esteemed sect and other sects from the Central Plains to witness it."</p><p>Seeing them reaching an agreement so readily, Zhu Wudao felt a sense of foreboding, his gaze darkening.  He glanced at Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao. Since the Daoists appeared, these two had remained aloof, as if distancing themselves from the situation.</p><p>Earlier, Mo Xingdao had forced him to reveal the information about the Wordless Jade Wall.  Now, having used his Gold Aspect Token to enter, he was no longer of use to them. Their intentions were crystal clear.</p><p>The only good news was that Yue Lingtian wasn't present.</p><p>Seeing Purple Thunder Patriarch's forthrightness, Old Devil Fan couldn't press the matter further.  He subconsciously glanced at Zhu Wudao, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes.</p><p>Just then, Zhu Wudao's voice whispered into his ear.</p><p>Surprise flickered in Old Devil Fan's eyes.  Then, with righteous indignation, he declared, "Junior Brother Zhu openly violated the sect's rules, colluding with the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect! This is an act of utter defiance!  This elder will personally bring him back to the sect and enforce the clan's laws..."</p><p>Before he could finish, Purple Thunder Patriarch's figure blurred.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's heart sank as a deafening thunderclap erupted beside him.  Blinding lightning engulfed the spot where Zhu Wudao stood, obscuring his figure.  Then, a clear crane cry resonated as an immortal crane soared into the sky!</p><p>The two Grand Cultivators of Eight Scenery Mountain, sharing a single mind, took action when they realized they couldn't persuade Old Devil Fan.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang offered a distant salute, his phoenix wings beating rapidly as he flew towards the mountain without looking back.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao exchanged glances and, ignoring Zhu Wudao's plight, pursued Qin Sang. "Don't escape!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan was left alone, cursing under his breath.</p><p>…</p><p>Below the sea of clouds.</p><p>Two figures hid in a secluded corner, not daring to move as they sensed the clash of Grand Cultivators above.</p><p>"So many Grand Cultivators."</p><p>Kun Dao stuck out her tongue, sensing the powerful auras in the clouds, thankful for her senior brother's decisiveness.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist stared intently upwards, sensing three auras receding into the distance as the others became a tangled mess. "Let's go!"</p><p>The two concealed their auras and cautiously navigated through the area.</p>
