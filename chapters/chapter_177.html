**Chapter 170: The Hidden Viper**

Amidst the surging torrent of water element force, a slender, exceptionally toxic needle followed the tumultuous waves. The needle itself was a faint shade of green, but its diminutive size rendered it barely noticeable beneath the vast veil of water element force.

The rampaging spiritual energy of the water element sought to destroy all in its path. The Devouring Yuan Cone detonated right before Bai Yunshan's eyes, its terrifying force causing him to sense the imminent threat of death. In a state of utter panic, he recalled the Heavenly Ensnaring Pouch, which had been keeping the Corpse Fiend at bay.

At that very moment, the Corpse Fiend lashed out with a claw, striking the Heavenly Ensnaring Pouch.

*Sizzle!*

The Heavenly Ensnaring Pouch violently fluttered after being subjected to the combined assault of the Devouring Yuan Cone and the Corpse Fiend. It was abruptly torn open, its spiritual light dissipating as this supreme-grade artifact was destroyed in an instant.

Although most of the impact had been offset by the Heavenly Ensnaring Pouch, the remaining water element force still possessed formidable power. It gave Bai Yunshan no chance to evade before engulfing him entirely.

Bai Yunshan let out a stifled groan, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth as his injuries seemed severe. He hurriedly activated several defensive artifacts to protect his body and desperately retreated.

However, he failed to notice that at the instant the Heavenly Ensnaring Pouch was damaged, the venomous needle flashed by, easily piercing through his protective spiritual energy and plunging deep into his abdomen.

Bai Yunshan felt a slight prick in his abdomen, but before he could identify the cause, a numbing sensation abruptly spread throughout his body. The potent snake venom erupted within him!

This venomous needle was an addition suggested by Qin Sang to Master Wu, containing nine-tenths of the venom from the serpent demon's two fangs.

Integrating the venomous needle into the Devouring Yuan Cone was no simple matter of adding one or two steps; it even required altering the entire artifact's refining process.

Master Wu initially believed the chances of success were slim. Qin Sang promised that even if the refinement failed and the materials were destroyed, he wouldn't seek compensation. Moreover, by observing the Dragon Carp Sword, Master Wu had gained new insights, significantly enhancing his artifact refinement skills. Only then did he dare to accept the request. He dedicated himself to the research, and to his and Qin Sang's delight, he succeeded within a few days.

The Devouring Yuan Cone's explosive power was already considerable, and with the addition of this inconspicuous venomous needle, it became even more treacherous. As expected, Bai Yunshan had fallen for the trap.

Seeing that the venomous needle had been effective, Qin Sang inwardly rejoiced and secretly retracted the Dark Yin Thunder.

The Dark Yin Thunder had been a precaution in case Bai Yunshan didn't take the bait. Now, it was no longer necessary.

The serpent demon was a formidable monster at the Demonic Spirit Realm, and its venom was extraordinary. Even if a Foundation Establishment cultivator didn't succumb to the venom immediately, it would still cause immense trouble.

The snake venom was as if salt on an open wound for Bai Yunshan. To his horror, he discovered that not only was his body becoming paralyzed, but even the remaining spiritual energy within him started to stagnate.

All of this transpired in but a flash.

While Bai Yunshan was being ambushed by Qin Sang, the Corpse Fiend at the side surprisingly chose not to pursue. It had sensed the explosive force of the Devouring Yuan Cone and dared not advance further, instead turning around to charge at Qin Sang.

At that moment, several *whooshing* sounds rang out. Six Ten Directions Yama Banners flew out of Qin Sang's palms, transforming into jet-black banners that were planted firmly into the ground. The Ten Directions Yama Formation unfolded, its banners fluttering and billowing out dense black energy. Wisps of soul silk emerged, enveloping both Bai Yunshan and the Corpse Fiend.

While luring Bai Yunshan earlier, Qin Sang had also been tirelessly devising his escape plan. Killing Bai Yunshan wasn't the end; he still had to face the Corpse Fiend alone. Only by eliminating the Corpse Fiend and breaking the restriction on the black iron heavy gate could he truly escape danger.

Thus, while confusing Bai Yunshan, Qin Sang had simultaneously focused on preparing the Ten Directions Yama Formation, intending to capture both Bai Yunshan and the Corpse Fiend in one fell swoop.

When the enemy is weak, strike.

Seizing the opportunity while Bai Yunshan was distracted, Qin Sang unhesitatingly activated the Ten Directions Yama Formation with full force. Within the impenetrable darkness, countless strands of soul silk surged forth, seizing the chance to疯狂涌进白云山人体内。

The soul silk directly burned the divine soul. Such pain was beyond what an ordinary person could withstand.

"Ah!"

A heart-wrenching scream reverberated throughout the palace hall. Bai Yunshan's divine soul was damaged, his body covered in wounds. His hair was disheveled, his face contorted, and his expression twisted with agony. His maddened cries were hoarse and inhuman, utterly miserable.

Qin Sang watched calmly with eyes that showed no trace of emotion. In that instant, a hint of surprise appeared on his face as he turned to look at the zombie.
These soul-devouring threads could injure a cultivator's soul, but they were supposed to be ineffective against zombies.
Unexpectedly, when the zombie came into contact with the soul-devouring threads, it began to emit furious roars as if it were experiencing intense pain. It charged through the Ten Yama Formation, much to Qin Sang's astonishment.
Qin Sang frowned slightly and flicked his fingers. The Five Elements Sword rapidly entered the formation, piercing straight through Baiyun Mountain Man and killing him on the spot. Then, without even glancing at Baiyun Mountain Man's corpse, he rearranged the Ten Yama Formation. The black energy transformed into a monstrous beast, which savagely clashed with the zombie.
The zombie was trapped in the formation. The endless soul-devouring threads left it nowhere to hide, and its elusive evasion techniques became ineffective. It could only engage in a brutal fight with the monstrous beast.
After being repeatedly attacked by Qin Sang and the others, the zombie's Profound Yellow Armor had been greatly damaged. However, it remained ferocious and quickly overwhelmed the monstrous beast.
The monstrous beast was at a disadvantage and could neither injure the zombie nor delay it for long.
Qin Sang remained outside the formation, urging the Five Elements Sword to launch several swift attacks. But the results were equally insignificant. Strangely, he had not used the Ebony Sword.
At this moment, Qin Sang turned his head and looked at the subterranean passage behind him. The passage was deep and dark, and the faint sounds of rumbling echoed from within, indicating that the Earth Fiend Qi had not yet reached its limits.
First, they had been delayed by the zombie and then by Baiyun Mountain Man's treachery and his assault on Wu Yuesheng. This had wasted a considerable amount of time, and they could likely be overtaken by the Earth Fiend Qi.
A look of worry and anxiety appeared on Qin Sang's face. He turned back to look at the zombie and fell into deep thought. Then, he suddenly retrieved a bolt of lightning-struck spirit wood from his storage pouch and sat down.
The lightning-struck spirit wood contained the power of heavenly lightning, a nemesis to evil beings. When combined with the癸水阴雷 Curse, its power would increase several times over.
Qin Sang held the lightning-struck spirit wood in his hand, pointed it at the zombie, and began to mutter a mantra. He seemed to be fully focused on preparing the spell.
Soon, he completed the mantra, and the lightning force within the lightning-struck spirit wood was drawn out. A bolt of pure and potent lightning gradually materialized before Qin Sang's eyes. The thunder roared, intertwining with the zombie's growls.
Within the hall, there were skeletons, ancient metal zombies, vicious ghosts, the zombie, a demonic banner, ghost formations, and three fresh corpses. It was a realm of darkness. The blood flowing beneath Wu Yuesheng's body began to emit an eerie glow.
Kacha!
A bolt of lightning as thick as an arm struck the zombie, and the blinding light illuminated the gloomy hall as bright as day.
At the instant the lightning appeared, a small spirit sword emerged silently from the pool of blood beneath Wu Yuesheng's corpse — it was Wu Yuesheng's personal spirit sword!
The spirit sword stealthily aimed at Qin Sang's defenseless back, moving with lightning speed.
Its sword energy was heaven-shaking!
