<h1>Chapter 1477: Breaking Through the Realm (4k)</h1><p>---</p><p>**Netherworld Soil.**  </p><p>**Primordial Yin Water.**  </p><p>**Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit.**  </p><p>...  </p><p>A myriad of spiritual materials lay before Qin Sang.  </p><p>To set up the Spirit Ascension Ritual, the first step was to forge an altar. The Netherworld Soil and Primordial Yin Water were the core components, indispensable for the ritual. When combined with the Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit, they could unleash a miraculous effect.  </p><p>The process of forging the altar shared some similarities with artifact crafting, a task Qin Sang was more than capable of handling.  </p><p>He first reviewed the method of altar forging in his mind.  </p><p>Concerned that the overbearing aura of the Nine Nether Demon Flame might interfere with the altar's efficacy, Qin Sang decided to use only his Nascent Flame. He placed his hands on his knees, palms facing upward, and the Nascent Flame drifted out, coalescing into a ball before him.  </p><p>His gaze swept over the array of spiritual materials. Without any visible movement from Qin Sang, a piece of spiritual material resembling a rotten tree root floated up and entered the Nascent Flame.  </p><p>In an instant, the material was engulfed by the flame.  </p><p>Under the Nascent Flame's refinement, the material did not melt or turn to ash. Instead, its impurities were burned away, leaving behind a substance as hard as tempered steel.  </p><p>Piece by piece, the material was shaped into the skeleton of the altar.  </p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang continuously drew in other spiritual materials, refining them into spiritual liquids or burning them into fine dust, which he then integrated into the skeleton.  </p><p>As Qin Sang worked, the surface of the skeleton flickered with multicolored lights. Each flash signified the birth of a new rune, marking a fundamental change in its nature.  </p><p>Time passed.  </p><p>Once the skeleton was complete, Qin Sang took a moment to regulate his breathing before continuing to enrich the altar with other spiritual materials.  </p><p>Before him, a square altar gradually took shape, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. When not activated, the altar was no larger than an inkstone, its entire body a deep, unremarkable black.  </p><p>*Whoosh...*  </p><p>The Nascent Flame continued to refine the altar.  </p><p>Sweat dripped from Qin Sang's temples as his true essence was heavily depleted. Yet, he remained oblivious, for he had reached the most critical moment.  </p><p>His eyes were fixed on the rotating altar, striving to discern every subtle change.  </p><p>Finally, the moment arrived.  </p><p>*Swoosh!*  </p><p>A piece of Netherworld Soil flew into the air, and with a crisp *crack*, the grayish-white stone shattered into a cloud of pale dust.  </p><p>Qin Sang multitasked, refining the altar while rapidly forming hand seals, channeling various runes into the Netherworld Soil.  </p><p>The Netherworld Soil soon underwent a peculiar transformation. The dust began to shimmer with white light, composed of countless tiny, radiant specks.  </p><p>"Go!"  </p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and the Netherworld Soil flowed like a river of light into the altar, seamlessly merging with it.  </p><p>Every part of the altar was now infused with Netherworld Soil.  </p><p>But this was not the end.  </p><p>Without pause, Qin Sang summoned a drop of Primordial Yin Water. The droplet hovered in his palm like a pearl, with a tiny vortex swirling within.  </p><p>He flicked his finger, and the droplet landed atop the altar, slowly dripping down.  </p><p>Now, the naked eye could see the fine streams of water spreading along the altar's surface patterns. Upon contact with the Netherworld Soil's power, new changes occurred. Various runes intertwined, forming an intricate and profound design on the altar's surface.  </p><p>One moment, it depicted mountains and rivers; the next, the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, and thunder.  </p><p>Behind these phenomena, faint silhouettes of insects flickered in and out of view.  </p><p>The altar seemed to come alive, radiating a dazzling light that illuminated the entire cave.  </p><p>Qin Sang slowly withdrew the Nascent Flame, his eyes narrowing as he gazed at the altar.  </p><p>Soon, the light faded, and the altar quietly settled into Qin Sang's palm. He activated his divine sense, carefully scanning it to ensure no flaws remained. Following the same method, he forged a second altar.  </p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang meditated to restore his energy and adjust his state. He then took the altars and spirit insects, quietly leaving the Snow Listening Pavilion.  </p><p>According to Valley Master Mu, the Spirit Ascension Ritual for spirit insects would create significant disturbances, which they had concealed using the sect's grand formation.  </p><p>Near the Snow Listening Pavilion, cultivators were a common sight. Qin Sang flew swiftly for a while before heading out to sea. He had previously scouted an island. Due to the demon beast incursions, cultivators dared not remain offshore, and the island's inhabitants had abandoned their caves and fled to the mainland.  </p><p>The island was now overrun by a horde of demon beasts, creating chaos.  </p><p>Qin Sang cleared out all the demon beasts, summoned his external avatar to stand guard, and then flew to the island's highest peak at its center, where he began his preparations.  </p><p>This location was also the island's most spiritually rich area, where the spiritual vein resided.  </p><p>Before long, Qin Sang completed the spirit formation required for the Spirit Ascension Ritual. With a wave of his hand, one of the altars flew straight to the formation's core.  </p><p>In mid-air, the altar radiated brilliant light and rapidly expanded, transforming into a massive platform that landed on the ground with a thunderous *boom*, shaking the mountain.  </p><p>Qin Sang leaped onto the altar, surveyed his surroundings, and nodded in satisfaction. He then lightly tapped his spirit beast pouch, summoning the Fire Jade Centipede.  </p><p>"Whether you can break through the realm depends on your fortune," Qin Sang murmured as he stroked the centipede's back.  </p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede gently nuzzled Qin Sang's finger. At his urging, it moved its thousand legs, transforming into a red streak of light that landed at the center of the altar, where it lay motionless.  </p><p>Its intelligence was low, and it was still naive, unaware of what its master intended to do.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky and waited for an hour until night fully descended, with the silver moon hanging high.  </p><p>He then sat cross-legged beside the Fire Jade Centipede, closed his eyes, and attempted to connect with its consciousness.  </p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was not his bonded spirit insect, and there was always a barrier between them, unlike the closeness he shared with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. However, after consuming a Myriad Spirit Fruit, its spiritual nature had significantly improved.  </p><p>"It's time to begin..."  </p><p>Qin Sang crushed the Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit and fed its juice to the Fire Jade Centipede while activating the formation and the altar.  </p><p>After consuming the fruit, the Fire Jade Centipede's body went limp, as if intoxicated, swaying unsteadily. Yet, Qin Sang could sense that its consciousness was clearer than ever before.  </p><p>*Hum!*  </p><p>The altar trembled.  </p><p>Strange lights shot into the sky.  </p><p>Around the Fire Jade Centipede, the lights transformed into the shape of a jade bowl, exuding profound mystery.  </p><p>Simultaneously, the surrounding environment was influenced by the altar's power.  </p><p>A sudden wind arose!  </p><p>Though no clouds were visible in the sky, faint thunder rumbled in the distance.  </p><p>A fierce gale swept across the island, uprooting trees and leaving the landscape in disarray.  </p><p>This was no ordinary sea breeze but a celestial phenomenon triggered by the altar's activation, drawing in spiritual energy that continuously converged toward the altar.  </p><p>The altar's light grew increasingly dazzling.  </p><p>The silver moon also brightened, as if within arm's reach.  </p><p>The cool moonlight poured down, merging with the spiritual energy as it gathered within the jade bowl. The liquid-like light inside the bowl rippled gently.  </p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell on the runes flickering across the altar's surface, his eyes filled with wonder. These runes were seamlessly integrated, harmonizing with nature, giving him a sense of familiarity.  </p><p>The divine patterns of the Witch Clan!  </p><p>Moreover, as the runes manifested, the insect-like phantoms became increasingly distinct. They resembled the witch dancers of the Winged Serpent Village, performing a ritual dance atop the altar.  </p><p>Though these phantoms were not real and their forms were bizarre, they exuded an otherworldly beauty, profound and mysterious.  </p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed the Fire Jade Centipede's consciousness beginning to waver. He dared not distract himself further, focusing entirely on soothing the centipede's mind.  </p><p>Under the altar's influence, the moonlight and spiritual energy transformed into the "water" within the jade bowl, pure and gradually filling it, submerging the Fire Jade Centipede.  </p><p>During this process, the centipede's potential was unleashed as it absorbed and endured the energy contained within the "water," its aura steadily rising.  </p><p>This energy was a double-edged sword.  </p><p>While it surged into the Fire Jade Centipede's body, it also assaulted its consciousness, bringing indescribable pain.  </p><p>At the centipede's level, it would not easily lose itself, but the energy was too vast—a powerful force capable of helping it break through its bottleneck.  </p><p>Additionally, the forced activation of its potential would also affect its own foundation.  </p><p>If this were his bonded spirit insect, Qin Sang would have various methods to assist the Fire Jade Centipede. But now, his ability to help was limited.  </p><p>He poured all his energy into activating the altar, ensuring the power within the jade bowl was as gentle as possible, while continuously soothing and calling out to the centipede to prevent its consciousness from scattering.  </p><p>As time passed, the Fire Jade Centipede's aura grew stronger, steadily approaching the fourth transformation.  </p><p>However, Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly grave, for the centipede's consciousness was becoming more and more blurred.  </p><p>If not for the Myriad Spirit Fruit it had consumed, it would have already succumbed.  </p><p>Qin Sang could sense the centipede's indomitable will, its desperate struggle to hold on. Even an ant harbored the desire to grow stronger—this was instinct, let alone a spirit insect.  </p><p>Its body curled into a ball, emitting a dense red light that pulsed as if its body were expanding, filled with instability, on the verge of collapse.  </p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn, his mind tense.  </p><p>He hesitated, allowing the Fire Jade Centipede to endure a while longer, but ultimately, fate could not be defied.  </p><p>"Enough."  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and forcibly halted the Spirit Ascension Ritual.  </p><p>The jade bowl shattered, and the power within exploded, destroying the altar beneath.  </p><p>In the final moment, Qin Sang grabbed the Fire Jade Centipede and appeared in the distant void.  </p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede clung tightly to Qin Sang's finger, letting out a mournful cry. Though weak, its voice carried a deep sense of unwillingness.  </p><p>"Though you failed to break through, you've gained much from this. Consider it an opportunity. The time simply wasn't right, but there will be chances in the future."  </p><p>Qin Sang conveyed his thoughts, comforting the Fire Jade Centipede.  </p><p>This was no empty reassurance. Even if the Spirit Ascension Ritual failed, the process of unleashing potential and breaking through bottlenecks would still benefit the spirit insect.  </p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede seemed to understand, its body gradually relaxing as it fell into a deep sleep.  </p><p>Qin Sang stored it back in his spirit beast pouch and surveyed the island. Waves churned in the distance, and demon beasts began to emerge from all directions, drawn by the earlier phenomenon.  </p><p>However, these demon beasts dared not approach the island, for Qin Sang's external avatar exuded a Nascent Soul-level aura, instilling instinctive fear in them.  </p><p>Qin Sang quickly erased all traces, retrieved his external avatar, and departed.  </p><p>Arriving at another spiritually rich island, Qin Sang repeated the process, setting up the second altar. This time, he summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly instead of the Fat Silkworm.  </p><p>During the previous Spirit Ascension, Qin Sang had gained some insight.  </p><p>The Fat Silkworm was even less capable than the Fire Jade Centipede. It wasn't even his spirit insect, and he could offer almost no assistance or precise control. The Fat Silkworm would only endure for a short time, gaining little benefit.  </p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang was concerned that the Fat Silkworm's consciousness might be affected, which could impact Ya Gu. The Fat Silkworm had played a crucial role in Ya Gu's recent recovery, and Qin Sang decided it was best not to subject it to the Spirit Ascension Ritual.  </p><p>He sat in meditation for over an hour, reflecting on the gains and losses of the previous attempt and summarizing his lessons before summoning the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  </p><p>"It's up to you now..."  </p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was filled with affection as he whispered softly, a hint of nervousness in his heart.  </p><p>The opportunity for Spirit Ascension was a one-time event, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was not yet at the peak of the early fourth transformation, making this somewhat of a stretch.  </p><p>Her advantage lay in having consumed two Myriad Spirit Fruits, granting her a spiritual nature far surpassing her peers. Having undergone two metamorphoses and fused with the Azure Phoenix's thunder power, she could not be simply categorized as a spirit insect.  </p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang practiced orthodox Witch Clan secret techniques, giving him a higher chance of success than the Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew before Qin Sang, her wings gently brushing his face as if to comfort her master, before landing at the center of the altar, her wings raised.  </p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and, without further hesitation, fed her the spirit fruit and activated the altar.  </p><p>Every step proceeded smoothly.  </p><p>The "water" within the jade bowl condensed much more slowly than before, as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's absorption rate far exceeded that of the Fire Jade Centipede.  </p><p>The familiar sensation returned.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's consciousness began to fluctuate.  </p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he immediately employed Witch Clan secret techniques, offering his full assistance.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's aura climbed steadily, a promising sign.  </p><p>Soon, her cultivation reached the peak of the early fourth transformation—a temporary state resulting from the dual effects of potential activation and spiritual energy infusion. If the bottleneck was not broken, her cultivation would regress.  </p><p>At this point, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was still in control, not yet at her limit.  </p><p>But the next stage would be the most critical. The impact of breaking through the realm would far surpass anything before.  </p><p>*Splash!*  </p><p>A ripple formed within the jade bowl, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's wings trembled as she began her breakthrough!  </p><p>Qin Sang employed every secret technique he knew, offering his utmost assistance, but he could not prevent the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's consciousness from slipping toward the abyss. The impact she endured was incomparable to what the Fire Jade Centipede had faced.  </p><p>Her body shook, her wings tightly folded.  </p><p>Qin Sang could deeply sense the pain she was enduring.  </p><p>Like the Fire Jade Centipede, her consciousness, though wavering, remained resolute and unyielding.  </p><p>Yet, this alone could not help her break through.  </p><p>Time passed.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's condition gradually worsened, but there was still no sign of a breakthrough. Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a growing sense of anxiety.  </p><p>He opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on the Heavenly Eye Butterfly within the jade bowl. He had done all he could, and now he was like a rope, desperately pulling at her consciousness, calling out to her.  </p><p>He could not accept any damage to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's foundation. Once she reached her limit, regardless of the outcome, he would have to stop.  </p><p>Qin Sang's eyes dimmed as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly approached her limit, with no breakthrough in sight.  </p><p>Then, suddenly, a change occurred.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's wings abruptly spread open.  </p><p>Was it an illusion?  </p><p>The eyes on her wings seemed to blink.  </p><p>*Crack!*  </p><p>A bolt of lightning illuminated the jade bowl.  </p><p>The moment Qin Sang sensed the lightning, he felt an instinctive dread. This lightning carried the true essence of heavenly tribulation, stronger and more real than before.  </p><p>This was the might of heaven, yet it manifested on a tiny butterfly.  </p><p>"This is..."  </p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.  </p><p>The tribulation lightning dispersed within the jade bowl, countless electric threads dancing within the "water."  </p><p>In the next moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly absorbed the lightning back into her body, and the "water" in the jade bowl seemed to encounter a funnel.  </p><p>Like a whale swallowing the sea, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly drained the jade bowl in an instant!  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>Thunder and lightning flashed in the sky, resonating with the tribulation lightning.  </p><p>The jade bowl and the altar both crumbled.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly, trailing a long phoenix tail, flapped her wings and soared, her aura rapidly climbing alongside her.  </p><p>Mid fourth transformation!</p>
