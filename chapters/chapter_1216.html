<h1>Chapter 1208: The Malevolent Spirit</h1><p>Beside the Serpent King stood two other figures.  </p><p>One was a human cultivator, elegant and poised like a jade tree in the wind, while the other was a Frost Lizard that had already revealed its true monstrous form.  </p><p>One mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator and two shape-shifting great demons.  </p><p>Among them, the Frost Lizard had the lowest cultivation level, only at the early stage of shape-shifting.  </p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang immediately understood that these two were the helpers the Serpent King had mentioned. The human cultivator was surnamed Lu, and the Frost Lizard was likely the one who had discovered the great demon's cave.  </p><p>Despite the three of them joining forces, the situation was extremely unfavorable. They were being besieged, unable to break free, and were gradually being pushed into a disadvantageous position. The Frost Lizard had even been forced to reveal its true form.  </p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and stopped at a distance to observe, quickly turning his attention to their opponents.  </p><p>Among those besieging them were two individuals and a strange entity.  </p><p>The two were undoubtedly Nascent Soul cultivators from the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>Although Qin Sang had never seen them in person, he had read about them and recognized one as a black-robed cultivator surnamed Ma, while the other was a gray-robed elder with the Daoist title Jiang Chenzi. Both were renowned Nascent Soul ancestors who had been famous for a long time.  </p><p>Each of them wielded a peculiar banner, but they were only at the early stage of Nascent Soul, and with one less person, the Serpent King's side should have been far stronger. They shouldn't have been trapped like this.  </p><p>However, the true opponent of the Serpent King's group wasn't these two, but that strange entity.  </p><p>What Qin Sang found strange was that he had never seen anything like it before.  </p><p>It appeared as a colossal azure serpent, its body unimaginably large, with its tail coiled and its upper body towering a hundred zhang high. Yet, its form was as ethereal as a spirit, resembling a serpent specter.  </p><p>Even the Serpent King, a serpent demon himself, seemed as insignificant as an ant compared to this serpent specter.  </p><p>The serpent specter was neither human nor demon. Its eyes shone like stars, but its gaze was filled with intense resentment, rage, and madness—a convergence of all negative emotions, devoid of any rationality.  </p><p>It didn't seem like a living being but more like a malevolent spirit that existed solely for slaughter and destruction.  </p><p>From a distance, Qin Sang felt a chill just from meeting the malevolent spirit's gaze. It was hard to imagine how such a spirit, filled with hatred for all things in the world, had come into existence.  </p><p>He wondered what the Serpent King and his companions had done to provoke such wrath from the malevolent spirit.  </p><p>The malevolent spirit focused solely on attacking them, completely ignoring the two from the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>"Blood Lake!"  </p><p>The fat chicken inside the Primordial Unity Ring let out a startled cry, as if it had seen something unbelievable.  </p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang shifted his gaze and noticed that behind the battlefield, the endless dark clouds had split apart, revealing a dense crimson light that pierced through, sending shivers down his spine.  </p><p>The source of the crimson light was a vast lake, its waters shimmering with an eerie blood-red hue.  </p><p>At that moment, the Blood Lake was eerily calm, without a single ripple. It was unclear whether the malevolent spirit had emerged from it.  </p><p>The fat chicken fell silent after its exclamation, and Qin Sang, not in the mood to deal with it, continued to focus on the battlefield, his eyes flickering with uncertainty.  </p><p>He had found the treasure that had attracted the Fire Jade Centipede—a lump of white metal the size of a human head, resembling some kind of white bronze. Its form seemed to flow, as if it weren't solid.  </p><p>The white light it emitted was as dazzling as flames, rivaling the intensity of the sun, making it impossible to look at directly.  </p><p>Qin Sang had never seen such a spiritual material before.  </p><p>Both the Fire Jade Centipede's reaction and the external appearance of the white bronze suggested that this item was extraordinary!  </p><p>However, the lump of white bronze was inside the malevolent spirit!  </p><p>Beside the white bronze were two other items—a broken stone axe and a piece of blood jade, both clearly of great significance, likely no less valuable than the white bronze.  </p><p>To retrieve these treasures, one would have to attack the malevolent spirit, essentially plundering them from its very heart.  </p><p>"Roar!"  </p><p>The malevolent spirit harbored deep hatred for the Serpent King and his companions. Seeing that it couldn't kill these three insignificant beings that had provoked it, it grew furious, its malevolent aura shaking heaven and earth.  </p><p>Opening its massive maw, it let out a roar, and a ball of azure light began to form, carrying an aura of destruction. It shot forward like lightning.  </p><p>Seeing the azure light, the Serpent King and his companions paled.  </p><p>Among them, the Serpent King was still in relatively good fighting condition, though his breathing was slightly labored.  </p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu was bleeding from all seven orifices, too preoccupied to wipe the blood from his face, clearly suffering from severe injuries.  </p><p>The Frost Lizard's monstrous form stretched over a dozen zhang long, a fearsome giant lizard capable of controlling frost. Yet, compared to the serpent specter, it still seemed insignificant. Moreover, its cultivation was the weakest. Although it frequently spewed frost, it could only manage to protect itself.  </p><p>As the azure light surged toward them, they attempted to evade.  </p><p>On the Sin Abyss side, the two Nascent Soul cultivators sneered coldly and immediately activated the banners before them.  </p><p>In an instant, the banners lit up with glowing runes, and a swirling void appeared on their surfaces. Two beams of crimson light shot out, converging in mid-air to form a torrent that slammed into the Serpent King's group, sealing off their escape routes.  </p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators' control was precise—the torrent targeted only the Serpent King's group, ensuring it wouldn't accidentally harm the malevolent spirit.  </p><p>At first glance, it almost seemed as if the malevolent spirit was an ally summoned by the two Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>In fact, the malevolent spirit had been aiding them in dealing with their enemies all along.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, our Sin Abyss never intended to make an enemy of you. But since you've stumbled into the Abyss Ruins of your own accord, you can't blame us for being ruthless!"  </p><p>Jiang Chenzi spoke coldly.  </p><p>The black-robed cultivator surnamed Ma chuckled darkly, "Heh, you outsiders trespassing into the Abyss Ruins are practically seeking your own deaths! This serpent specter was tormented for who knows how long in its past life, its consciousness completely eroded, leaving only resentment and hatred. It has become a pure malevolent spirit. By provoking it, you've ensured it will fight you to the death. Even we had to carefully prepare and call for reinforcements before daring to confront it. It's just your bad luck, Fellow Daoists. If not for the malevolent spirit, you might have actually succeeded in stealing the treasures unnoticed."  </p><p>As they attacked, they taunted the Serpent King's group with mocking tones, their expressions relaxed.  </p><p>After all, the malevolent spirit wouldn't attack them. The two of them didn't need to engage in direct combat with the Serpent King's group. They merely had to seize the right moment to strike, cutting off their retreat and preventing them from escaping.  </p><p>Then, they could leisurely wait for the malevolent spirit to finish off the Serpent King's group one by one. Once that was done, they could easily reap the rewards and then deal with the weakened malevolent spirit to claim the treasures within it.  </p><p>In a way, they had to thank the Serpent King's group—not only for delivering the treasures but also for bearing the brunt of the malevolent spirit's wrath.  </p><p>Facing the imminent crisis, the Serpent King and his companions had no time to retort. They focused entirely on the malevolent spirit's movements, their minds racing as they desperately sought a way to escape.  </p><p>"Frost Lizard!"  </p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu shouted.  </p><p>The Frost Lizard opened its mouth and spat out a snow pearl.  </p><p>In an instant, a chilling aura emerged, and snowflakes as large as goose feathers began to swirl around the pearl, forming a snowy domain. At the same time, the cultivator surnamed Lu acted. He held a thumb-sized gourd in his hand, tilting it slightly to release an endless stream of river water.  </p><p>The river water flowed into the snowy domain, instantly freezing into a thick layer of ice. A massive ice ball formed around the snow pearl, its interior glowing with a deep blue light, mysterious and profound. The extreme cold seemed capable of freezing even one's soul.  </p><p>A Nascent Soul ancestor and a shape-shifting great demon had combined their powers in this way.  </p><p>"Go!"  </p><p>The snow pearl, still controlled by the Frost Lizard, shot straight toward the azure light.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the cultivator surnamed Lu coughed violently, a trace of blood appearing on his lips. The effort of coordinating with the Frost Lizard had aggravated his injuries.</p>
