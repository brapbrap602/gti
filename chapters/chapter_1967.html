<h1>Chapter 1958: The Number One Scholar</h1><p>“A teahouse?”</p><p>Yu Lang had thought his Senior Sister would open a medical clinic.  “A teahouse is good too. The capital is a mix of dragons and fish, and displaying too much medical skill might attract unwanted attention, disturbing our peace.”</p><p>Gradually, they approached the capital city.</p><p>The tall and imposing city walls inspired awe. Their enormous shadows enveloped pedestrians, resembling a monstrous beast devouring all who entered, yet never satiated.</p><p>The Senior Sister and Junior Brother removed their Daoist robes and donned ordinary clothes, blending into the crowd.</p><p>Their steeds attracted many gazes, but being in the imperial capital, no one dared to cause trouble.</p><p>After smoothly entering the city, the two wandered around, experiencing the local customs and atmosphere before heading directly to the Tao family residence.</p><p>Living in the capital was no easy feat, but the Tao family was a prominent and wealthy household, their residence magnificent and opulent.</p><p>Anye Ward, where the Tao residence was located, was considered one of the capital's prime residential areas. Several princes and nobles also had their mansions there, showcasing the Tao family's remarkable commercial achievements.</p><p>The two found the Tao residence and announced themselves.</p><p>The gatekeeper, having received prior instructions, immediately notified the steward, who greeted them warmly, “Are you Young Master Yu Lang and Miss Xiao Wu? The Eldest Young Master is not at home, but he left instructions for you two to stay in his courtyard.”</p><p>The Tao residence was vast, with internal gardens offering changing scenery that shut out the city's hustle and bustle, a tranquil oasis within the chaos.</p><p>The steward led them, allowing them to enjoy the scenery as they walked.</p><p>“The Eldest Young Master also specifically instructed that you are free to access the Tao family library and browse any books.  No one in the Tao residence will disturb you,” the steward said.</p><p>Yu Lang thought to himself, Tao Teng truly understands me.</p><p>The steward continued, “If you have any other needs, just let us know. The Eldest Young Master has given orders that the Tao residence will do its utmost to fulfill all your requests!”</p><p>Yu Lang glanced at Xiao Wu. “We want to acquire a teahouse. Does the esteemed steward have any recommendations?”</p><p>“A teahouse?”</p><p>The steward was slightly taken aback, then pondered for a moment. “Most of the Tao family's businesses are located in Guangwei, Anshan, and Yan Kang Wards. Any of them could be converted into a teahouse. Do you have any preferences?”</p><p>From the Eldest Young Master's attitude towards these two, the steward could guess they were no ordinary people.</p><p>Their purpose in opening a teahouse was certainly not for profit.</p><p>“Not too large or small, with a moderate number of patrons.  It doesn't need to be overly refined; people from all walks of life should be welcome, but it shouldn’t be too boisterous either. Perhaps two storytellers, just a simple, peaceful existence…”</p><p>These were Xiao Wu’s own requirements, which Yu Lang relayed.</p><p>“I understand. I will select a few suitable properties and invite you to choose,” the steward replied.</p><p>Efficient and decisive, the steward escorted them to Tao Teng’s courtyard, saw to their settlement, and immediately excused himself. The next morning, he took them out by carriage to inspect the properties.</p><p>The steward presented four options.  Xiao Wu took a liking to the first one at first glance.</p><p>Within the capital, a location with a view of lakes and mountains was a rare find.</p><p>There were several famous inner lakes in the city, one of which was called Yuyao Lake, named for its resemblance to a beautiful woman’s slender waist, captivating all who beheld it.</p><p>The Tao family's property there was a two-story wooden building on the shores of Yuyao Lake, with a large portion of its foundation extending over the water. A small courtyard stood beside it, offering a superb view.</p><p>Many people visited Yuyao Lake daily, ensuring a steady stream of potential customers.</p><p>Crucially, Yuyao Lake's location was ideal. Xuanren Ward upstream was an upper-class residential area for officials and nobles, while Chang'an Ward downstream was a commoner's district. The building's position in the middle to lower section of Yuyao Lake wouldn't discourage commoners.</p><p>Yu Lang was also extremely satisfied. "This place isn't far from the Imperial Academy. It's a pity I can't always come to help Senior Sister. After I enter officialdom, I might need to use disguises to visit.  Brother Shi’s manuals include some rather ingenious disguise techniques."</p><p>"This place was originally a chess house. A few modifications will suffice. I'll immediately instruct the workers to begin. It should be completed within three days," the steward said.</p><p>He knew the inside story.  Ostensibly a chess house, this place had another purpose, serving as a discreet venue for the Tao family to entertain important guests.</p><p>However, since the Eldest Young Master had given the order, and the Tao family elders had acquiesced, whatever it had been before, it would now be changed.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Yu Lang stopped the steward and took out several gold ingots.  "Is this enough to purchase this property?"</p><p>"This… I am acting on the Eldest Young Master's orders.  It was meant as a gift…"</p><p>The steward appeared troubled.</p><p>"This is the Tao family's property," Yu Lang stated.</p><p>The steward immediately understood.  This person was acquainted with the Eldest Young Master but was unwilling to be indebted to the Tao family.  Someone who could casually produce several gold ingots was clearly no ordinary individual.</p><p>Sometimes, favors weren't so easily sold.</p><p>That evening, the chess house was emptied, all the servants moved out, and by the third day, it was completely renovated and adorned with a new sign.</p><p>“Calling it a teahouse is fine, but too common. Qingyang Teahouse...sounds odd! Haha... Senior Sister, would Master be angry if he knew?”</p><p>Yu Lang almost burst out laughing as he looked at the sign. Turning, he saw his Senior Sister had already gone behind the counter, slipping into her role.</p><p>From now on, she would be a teahouse proprietress.</p><p>The Tao family had taken care of hiring the storytellers, waiters, and other staff, even providing the tea, charcoal, and pastries, relieving them of any burden.</p><p>“Eh? When did this become a teahouse?”</p><p>“I remember it used to be a chess house, all mysterious and closed off to most people.”</p><p>“Let’s go! Take a look…”</p><p>…</p><p>With its new sign, the teahouse quickly attracted a wave of customers. Finding the prices reasonable, the storytellers engaging, and the presence of a rare female proprietress intriguing, they settled in.</p><p>Gradually, the teahouse filled up.</p><p>Xiao Wu, initially a little awkward in handling matters, quickly became proficient.</p><p>The storytellers’ tales weren’t particularly gripping, but the patrons sipped their tea, chatted amongst themselves, occasionally listening attentively to a passage, thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p><p>Yu Lang helped out for a while, then sat behind the counter, listening to the customers' conversations.</p><p>After listening with interest for some time, Yu Lang said, "Senior Sister, I know why you wanted to open a teahouse.  How did you come up with this idea?”</p><p>Xiao Wu spoke softly, “Many years ago, on a river boat, Master treated someone’s illness. The payment was their stories, and I listened beside him. Back then, there were many I didn’t understand."</p><p>“It's interesting, but they’re ultimately other people's stories…”</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated. “Senior Sister, don’t you want to have your own story?”</p><p>“My own story?”</p><p>Xiao Wu gazed absently at the teahouse patrons.</p><p>"You could try leaving your own mark in the mortal world. For example, by wholeheartedly running this teahouse," Yu Lang suggested.</p><p>Worldly affairs, worldly wisdom.</p><p>Experiencing life, understanding human nature.</p><p>After that sudden betrayal and framing, his Senior Sister hadn’t withdrawn from the world but had subtly closed off her emotions.</p><p>Yu Lang himself was still somewhat naive and couldn’t directly guide his Senior Sister on matters of the heart.  He could only suggest she start with small things, allowing change to occur naturally.</p><p>This trip to the capital was an opportunity.</p><p>Xiao Wu said, “When we descended the mountain, Master told me I could try sealing my cultivation and becoming a true ordinary person.”</p><p>Yu Lang’s eyes lit up. “Master said that too? Master’s discerning eyes must have seen something deeper.  Senior Sister, are you planning to do that?”</p><p>Xiao Wu was silent for a moment, then hummed in agreement.  “There are many cultivators in the capital. You need to be careful.”</p><p>“The capital’s prosperity naturally attracts cultivators seeking wealth.  With the City God and the various ghosts and spirits presiding, they can't cause much trouble.  I’ll be navigating the mortal world and won't clash with them.  Don’t worry, Senior Sister! Besides, before entering the city, I left a mark.  Brother Shi will see it and come find us,” Yu Lang said confidently.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded, extending her right hand and tapping her finger between her eyebrows.</p><p>Vaguely, Yu Lang seemed to see a vast darkness, and within that darkness, a magnificent crown flashed, disappearing so quickly that he wondered if he’d imagined it.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. His Senior Sister had returned to normal, now fiddling with an abacus.</p><p>Outwardly, she appeared unchanged, but Yu Lang felt a subtle, indefinable shift. It was as if she retained only the outward semblance of her former self, her cultivation completely sealed away.</p><p>Just then, an unusual guest entered.</p><p>Yu Lang’s expression turned serious, and he quickly stood up.</p><p>Xiao Wu remained focused on her calculations, not out of disrespect, but because she, like the other mortals in the teahouse, couldn’t see this individual.</p><p>“Might you be the Day Wanderer God, sir?”</p><p>Yu Lang bowed slightly. He could tell the newcomer was a divine being but couldn’t discern their cultivation level, judging only by their attire.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The Day Wanderer God glanced at Xiao Wu, confirming she was mortal, and paid her no further attention.  “On the day you entered the city, a Yin official should have visited to inform you of the city’s regulations.  They saw you enter the Tao residence and refrained from intruding.”</p><p>“Your Excellency is wise.  This humble Daoist would never break the rules. Fellow Daoist Tao Teng invited me to the capital. He's currently out inspecting the lives of the people.  When he returns, we will visit the City God together.”</p><p>Yu Lang replied calmly and respectfully.</p><p>The Day Wanderer God grunted.  "In that case, I won't impose any restrictions on you, pending the City God's decision.  However, should you violate any laws, you will be expelled from the city.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist understands!”</p><p>Yu Lang called over a waiter and instructed, “Send the finest tea and pastries to the second-floor private room…”</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>The Day Wanderer God turned and departed.</p><p>…</p><p>Three months passed in a flash.</p><p>Tao Teng had written, saying he would return when the spring examination results were posted, aiming to befriend the newly appointed scholars, but he was a step behind.</p><p>Upon returning to the capital, Tao Teng went straight to the teahouse to see Yu Lang, bypassing his own residence.</p><p>“You’ve really decided to take the imperial examinations?”</p><p>Tao Teng was somewhat incredulous.  He hadn’t expected Yu Lang to embrace the mortal world so thoroughly.</p><p>“Indeed.  In three years, I hope to be on that list,” Yu Lang replied with a smile, a smile that held immense confidence.</p><p>“With your talent, brother, not only will you pass, you’ll be the top scholar! That’s wonderful!” Tao Teng paced excitedly. “While you pursue scholarly achievements, I can secure a position in the Imperial Guard. You and I, one civil, one martial, serving the Crown Prince together!”</p><p>“I haven’t even met the Crown Prince yet,” Yu Lang shook his head.</p><p>“True enough.  I should arrange a meeting for you, so you can see if my judgment is sound. But before that, we must visit the City God Temple.  Let’s go now, there’s no time to waste!”</p><p>Impatient as ever, Tao Teng pulled Yu Lang along.</p><p>They arrived at the City God Temple, where Yin officials immediately barred their way. After being announced, they were led across the boundary between the Yin and Yang realms to meet the City God.</p><p>Within the grand hall, the City God sat high above, looking down on them.</p><p>His powerful presence instinctively compelled submission.</p><p>Tao Teng dared not be disrespectful, and while Yu Lang also felt the pressure, he maintained his composure.</p><p>Master didn't exude such a heavy aura of authority. Yet, he felt this Yan Kingdom's Lord of Ghosts and Spirits lacked something compared to his Master.</p><p>Tao Teng respectfully explained their purpose, requesting the City God’s permission for Yu Lang to enter official service.</p><p>After he finished speaking, the hall fell silent.</p><p>Tao Teng's heart pounded.  If the City God refused, all would be for naught.</p><p>Finally, the City God spoke.</p><p>“Granted!”</p><p>His deep voice resonated through the hall, booming like thunder.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A beam of white light flew towards Yu Lang.  “Take this jade pendant.  You must not use spiritual power, or the pendant will be reclaimed, and you will be expelled from the mortal realm!  Those who harm others with spells will be punished according to the law!  Do you understand?”</p><p>“This junior understands!”</p><p>Yu Lang solemnly accepted the jade pendant.</p><p>Now, like his Senior Sister, he had become a mortal.</p><p>“You may leave!”</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the City God dismissed them.  A gentle force propelled them from the hall, and they followed the Yin officials back to the Yang realm.</p><p>Returning to the bustling streets, Tao Teng noticed Yu Lang standing still, gazing at the City God Temple.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”  Tao Teng nudged him with his shoulder.</p><p>“It was too easy.”</p><p>Yu Lang toyed with the jade pendant, identical to the one Tao Teng possessed. It concealed the aura of a cultivator and served as a means of surveillance.</p><p>“Isn’t it good that it was easy? It’s getting late, let’s head back!” Tao Teng was puzzled.</p><p>Yu Lang continued to frown.  After walking a short distance, he said softly, “The City God only met me once, neither testing my character nor my scholarship, and casually allowed a cultivator into the mortal world.”</p><p>“You really think it was casual?” Tao Teng rolled his eyes. “If it weren’t for Master’s influence, do you think any other cultivator could enter the imperial court?”</p><p>“I don’t know why, but I feel something is amiss.  Perhaps I’m overthinking it.”</p><p>Yu Lang glanced back, shaking his head slightly, then remembered something.  “When shall we visit your Master?”</p><p>“Master doesn’t wish to be disturbed during his closed-door cultivation. We’ll have another opportunity in the future.”</p><p>…</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Unknowingly, three years passed for the Senior Sister and Junior Brother in the capital.</p><p>On this day, the Qingyang Teahouse was closed.</p><p>The proprietress was absent, joining countless others gathered before the Xuande Gate of the Imperial Palace, awaiting the posting of the imperial examination results.</p><p>“The Number One Scholar is coming out! The Number One Scholar is coming out!”</p><p>“It’s Qin Yu Lang from Southern Shuzhou!”</p><p>“It's the Huiyuan! A triple first!”</p><p>…</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Ceremonial cannons roared, and celebratory music filled the air.</p><p>After a brief silence, a wave of cheers erupted.  Armored guards cleared the way, and the newly appointed Number One Scholar, adorned in red and ribbons, appeared on horseback, slowly entering everyone’s view.</p><p>As the saying went, a swift horse carries a proud scholar.</p><p>The celebratory parade through the streets was customary after the imperial examinations.</p><p>Behind the Number One Scholar, the other successful candidates followed, some on horseback, others on foot, all beaming with joy.  Only the Number One Scholar appeared calm, almost detached, as if his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>Suddenly, he spotted a familiar figure in the crowd, and a brilliant smile finally spread across his face.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>The crowd responded with enthusiastic cheers.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
