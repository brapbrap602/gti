<h1>Chapter 195: Decision</h1><p>Chapter 195: Decision</p><p>Shaohua Mountain, Dao Sect Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang did not know many people. After bidding farewell to Shopkeeper Wu at Wenyue Market, he came to Dao Sect Peak to say good-bye to Senior Brother Wen.</p><p>Senior Brother Wen was considered both a teacher and a friend in Qin Sang's eyes. Qin Sang had no master and did not know much about even the most basic knowledge. He often asked for advice from Senior Brother Wen, who was able to answer all of Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>Their friendship actually began over two mid-grade spirit stones, something they both found amusing when they thought about it.</p><p>"I didn't expect Junior Brother Qin to take the initiative to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield right after reaching Foundation Establishment. Your courage is something I can only admire," Senior Brother Wen exclaimed, raising his teacup. "I will drink tea in place of wine to see Brother Qin off."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. For his cultivation technique to be effective, he would have to endure the hardships of the battlefield if he wanted to reach Core Formation; he could not afford to seclude himself in his cave dwelling and focus solely on cultivation.</p><p>After drinking the tea, Qin Sang bowed to Senior Brother Wen and soared into the sky on his sword, heading towards Heavenly Master Peak.</p><p>By this time, there were already dozens of cultivators gathered at Heavenly Master Peak. They consisted of Shaohua Mountain disciples and also members of cultivation families. This was not the full number, however; since time was still early, not everyone had arrived.</p><p>Most of these people were at the Qi Refining stage. Several were at the Foundation Establishment stage. These were all people who were about to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The Qi Refining stage cultivators were mostly at layer ten or above, and many of them looked rather old, at least forty or fifty years of age.</p><p>These were the cultivators who had not been able to breakthrough to Foundation Establishment by fifty years of age, or who believed that they would not be able to breakthrough by fifty years of age. They were unwilling to give up, and had come to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to find opportunities to better their chances.</p><p>Some of the cultivators had no hope of reaching immortality, and only wanted to work hard to leave some resources to their descendants so that their descendants would not make the same mistakes as them.</p><p>After all, although the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was dangerous, it was also a place of opportunity. There were many legends in the cultivation world of people who had changed their destiny in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>On this point, Yun Cang Great Swamp could not compare to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang landed.</p><p>Everyone looked over at him at the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang did not see anyone he knew, so he walked over to a tree and sat down, waiting quietly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's distant attitude, some who had intended to come over and get to know him lost their enthusiasm.</p><p>It was clear that most of the people here were nervous as they faced their approaching departure. Some gathered in groups, gossiping and pouring out their unease.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be in meditation, but he actually spread out his Divine Consciousness and listened in on their conversations. Although he had collected as much information as possible about the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, there would inevitably be omissions. Since his future path was unknown, the more he could learn, the better.</p><p>After eavesdropping for a while, Qin Sang shook his head. The things these people were saying were similar to what he had already learned. Come to think of it, they were either Shaohua Mountain disciples or came from families affiliated with Shaohua Mountain. They had all obtained their information through Shaohua Mountain, so it was not surprising that there would be similarities.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to stop wasting his energy. Just as he was about to withdraw his Divine Consciousness, he suddenly heard a sound in the air. He looked up and saw a stream of light flying in their direction. From its strength, it could be surmised that this was a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, and this stream of light somehow seemed familiar.</p><p>'Pew!'</p><p>The stream of light stopped abruptly in front of Heavenly Master Peak, landing on a stone path and revealing the figure of a middle-aged cultivator. To Qin Sang's surprise, this was Yu Daiyue!</p><p>After the untimely deaths of his three Foundation Establishment stage companions on their return from the Heavenly Corpse Sect's branch, they had been separated by the Disciplinary Hall for questioning. After that, Qin Sang had not seen Yu Daiyue again.</p><p>When he saw Yu Daiyue again, Qin Sang found that he looked older than when they had parted over a year ago. How could such a drastic change occur in just a year?</p><p>Yu Daiyue's eyebrows were knit together, and his face was full of worry, as if he had encountered some unsolvable problem. He walked over slowly, and only nodded in greeting when several acquaintances called out to him.</p><p>Yu Daiyue had come to Heavenly Master Peak to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield too?</p><p>Qin Sang had not heard him say this before.</p><p>Since they had met, Qin Sang took the initiative to stand up and greet him. "Senior Brother Yu."</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue was surprised to see Qin Sang. "Junior Brother Qin is also going to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?"</p><p>"Yes," Qin Sang answered. "Senior Brother Yu is also going to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield? We will be able to travel together again."</p><p>Yu Daiyue was a little puzzled. "I remember that Junior Brother Qin is not very old, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I am just over forty."</p><p>"Why would you..."</p><p>Yu Daiyue suddenly remembered Qin Sang's talent, and he also understood the concept of different people having different aspirations. He stopped speaking halfway through and changed his tone, saying, "I've been stuck in the early stage of the Foundation Building period for so long, and I couldn't find an opportunity to break through in the cave. If I don't give it my all at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, my path of cultivation will likely be cut off. Being able to travel with fellow apprentice Qin is an unexpected joy. May I know what your plans are after this, fellow apprentice Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied uncertainly, "I also can't make up my mind now. Have you decided, fellow apprentice Yu?"</p><p>Xuanlu Pass was jointly governed by Mount Shaohua, Taiyi Danzong, and the Shangyuan Pure Palace. Mount Shaohua had about a third of the decision-making power. It was said that after disciples from the sect entered Xuanlu Pass, there were two best choices.</p><p>One was to join the Xuanlu Pass Guard and defend the pass. With Qin Sang's cultivation level, he would at least be a minor leader.</p><p>There were many benefits to joining the guard. Although they would also have to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to engage in events like hunting cloud beasts, each time they left, other guards would accompany them. It wasn't single combat, so it was much less dangerous. The sect would also provide them with a cave in the city for free, and their salaries were quite substantial.</p><p>The other option was a bit more free.</p><p>Xuanlu Pass inevitably had a number of covert tasks that required secrecy, or tasks that were deep in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. These missions were somewhat dangerous, and a group of trustworthy sect disciples was trained to do them specifically. They were called Shadow Guards.</p><p>After joining the Shadow Guards, you would only be assigned a maximum of one task every five years. If you didn't receive any tasks within five years, you were completely free. Once a mission was assigned, unless you had a valid reason, you couldn't refuse. Refusal would be treated as betraying the sect.</p><p>Of course, when the sect assigned missions, they would also consider the strength of each shadow guard. They wouldn't force them to do things beyond their abilities. However, it's hard to have your cake and eat it too, especially on the treacherous Ancient Immortal Battlefield. There was no way to guarantee safety.</p><p>The sect's support for the Shadow Guards was also very strong, but how much compensation you received depended on how well you did on the task.</p><p>Of course, you could choose to do nothing and not even make contact with the sect. You could enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield on your own like those unaffiliated cultivators. However, without being tied down by the sect, you could also forget about receiving any support from it.</p><p>Without the support of a strong force, it was destined to be difficult to gain ground on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Seeing was believing. Qin Sang decided that after entering Xuanlu Pass, he would check it out in person before making a plan.</p>
