**Chapter 289: Ambush**

As they were about to exit the tunnel, the group spotted the surrounding terrain. They were on a steep and towering cliff, separated from the savanna below by a narrow chasm.

"Conceal yourself! Hold your breath!"

Yu Kong whispered. He cast his Stealth spell, floating silently towards the ground.

Qin Sang scanned the area, eyeing the chasm.

Although not particularly wide, the chasm seemed bottomless. The Yin Qi was even denser than the Yin Specter Abyss, but it was less turbulent.

As they neared the chasm, Yu Kong abruptly stopped and gently pushed the two corpses forward.

They drifted towards opposite ends of the chasm, slowly descending along the edge, disappearing inch by inch.

As they fell, the runes Yu Kong drew on them flickered. The corpses eventually vanished, leaving no trace, including their auras.

Qin Sang released a strand of Divine Sense, scanning where they had disappeared. He detected nothing unusual.

Yu Kong moved with great caution, as if worried about startling something in the chasm. After concealing the corpses, he sighed in relief.

"Follow me," he transmitted. Instead of crossing the chasm, he led the group to a concealed position on the edge.

Though eager for the herbs, the group realized from Yu Kong's actions that the chasm held an unknown danger. They suppressed their impatience and stayed concealed.

Still not satisfied, Yu Kong drew similar runes around the group.

Qin Sang couldn't decipher the trap he had set for Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, but he knew they couldn't wait. If they didn't act now, Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan wouldn't have a chance to escape. He crushed the Harmony Pendant.

They waited, but no one emerged from the tunnel. Yu Kong remained calm.

Time passed.

Finally, a figure appeared at the entrance, followed by several others.

Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi led the group.

They had arrived together.

Their followers stood in separate formations behind them.

Qin Sang spotted Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan. He furrowed his brow. When he crushed the Harmony Pendant, he had warned them of the possible danger in the chasm, where Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi faced certain peril. But they had not seized the opportunity to escape.

With no way to communicate, Qin Sang couldn't tell if they had failed to leave or had other plans.

Unfazed by their arrival, Yu Kong said, "They're both here. This will be less troublesome."

Qin Sang glanced at the chasm.

Its depth likely concealed dangers beyond his comprehension, giving Yu Kong the confidence to eliminate Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi.

Unfortunately, he could no longer send messages through the Harmony Pendant to warn Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan. He could only hope for their safety.

If they died, he would have to rethink his plans. He had no qualms with Yu Kong, and he preferred a mutually beneficial outcome.

Even if Yu Kong plotted against him, he would not target him. Qin Sang's treasures were far more impressive than those of loose cultivators, compensating for some of the gap between them. With enough caution, he could find an opportunity to escape.

He even saw a chance to counterattack at the right moment.

Only Yan Wu troubled him, filling him with unease whenever he looked his way.

Qin Sang remained still, observing the approaching figures above.

The two groups stood at the entrance, gazing at the distant mountain.

――――

"Where is that Yu geezers?"

Sheng Yuanzi scanned the area, finding no one in the clearing or the cloud-covered mountains.

Staring in fascination, Luo Xingnan muttered, "Shao Chunhui has truly found a treasure trove! This must be the cave master's herbal garden. These herbs are at least a thousand years old, gleaming like the sun! That old dog is probably already up the mountain. We should move before he ruins it."

"Sheng Yuanzi glanced at Luo Xingnan. 'Since Shao Chunhui came back empty-handed last time, it shows that the restrictions in that smog are not simple. It is a good time to let that old demon Yu help us scout the way first. Why are you in such a hurry? Since we have confirmed that this is the handiwork of that old demon Yu, shouldn't you call back the people you planted beside me?'

"Since it couldn't be confirmed whether it was you or that old dog Yu, it was natural for me to prepare for both possibilities."

Being criticized outright, Luo Xingnan looked completely shameless and withdrew his obsessed stare. He waved his hand at a thin and shriveled old man behind Sheng Yuanzi. "Fellow Daoist Gong, come back."

The old man by the surname Gong took a step forward and cupped his hands towards Sheng Yuanzi. "Each man fights for his own master. I hope the Celestial Master will excuse me."

"Indeed it's you! Do you really think I dare not kill you?"

Sheng Yuanzi gave a cold hum, his gaze pressing and his killing intent obvious.

Under the pressuring aura of Sheng Yuanzi, the old man by the surname Gong trembled, and his face turned slightly pale.

Luo Xingnan took a step forward, helping the old man by the surname Gong block Sheng Yuanzi's aura. He said indifferently, "Tit for tat! Old Brahman, since we have decided to join hands against that old dog Yu, it is meaningless to haggle over such trifles as this. After killing that old dog Yu and getting the elixir, we shall each go our separate ways on the road to the Great Dao. I only wait until I have formed my Golden Core to burn an incense stick for your ashes upon my return. Before that, I have no interest in continuing to scheme against you. Furthermore... much less to say that I don't have any of your men around me."

"You want to form your Golden Core? In your next life perhaps!"

Sheng Yuanzi had a look of disdain as he pointed to a man dressed in a long robe behind Luo Xingnan. "Fellow Daoist Chen, don't worry. I guarantee that that old ghost Luo will not dare to lay a hand on you again in the future."

The man in the long robe only said, "I only hope that Senior will remember his promise."

Sheng Yuanzi gave a cold laugh and swept his gaze over the crowd behind him. He pointed at the distant mountains and said, "Look at the brilliance on those mountains. The elixirs there will be more than enough for us to take one each. However, the prerequisite is that we are able to break the restrictions and get rid of that old demon Yu, so I need everyone to give it your all. But if anyone tries to fool me, don't blame me for being merciless."

Luo Xingnan's words were to the same effect.

After warning everyone else, Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi discussed some things and then led everyone to swoop down the cliff.

"Hold on..."

Just when they were about to leap over the abyss, Sheng Yuanzi paused and motioned for everyone to stop.

Luo Xingnan asked with a frown, "Did your men leave secret marks?"

Sheng Yuanzi stared at the abyss and shook his head. "Not so..."

Luo Xingnan scoffed, "The more you live, the more regressed you become, old Brahman. It's just a small ditch. Can it scare you to this extent? If there were any danger, there would definitely be traces of fighting here."
