<h1>Chapter 606: The Black Tower</h1><p>“The five of you, seal your senses and sit on this cloud,” Elder Dongyang stood up, summoned a purple cloud, and addressed Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were taken aback. They exchanged glances, not daring to disobey Elder Dongyang's command nor to ask questions. They flew onto the purple cloud and sealed their senses.</p><p>The world plunged into darkness, oblivious to all external stimuli.</p><p>Chen Yan glanced at them and said indifferently, “Elder Dongyang is truly cautious, not even trusting his own disciples?”</p><p>“It’s not a matter of trust, but a precaution.”</p><p>Elder Dongyang gestured, and the purple cloud, carrying Qin Sang and the others, followed behind him.</p><p>“The entrance to this secret passage constantly shifts within the Heavenly Mountains. It's at the bottom of the lake now, but next time it might appear beneath an ancient tree. Only I know how to find it.</p><p>“However, the exit is fixed.</p><p>“I wouldn't want to be ambushed outside the exit next time.</p><p>“That old Redhair has coveted this passage for a long time. The previous Pure Yang Sect Master and my master fought over this passage and the key in my possession when they were alive. Fortunately, this passage doesn't lead to the core, it merely bypasses the trouble of breaking the formation. Otherwise, this unworthy descendant would have lost it long ago.</p><p>“That old man is neither entirely good nor evil. If they were to let something slip after exiting and the information leaks, being captured by the Pure Yang Cave and having their souls searched wouldn't be surprising.</p><p>“Knowing nothing is actually for their own good.”</p><p>Chen Yan said indifferently, “Does that mean I’ll also have to seal my senses when we exit the passage for you to be at ease?”</p><p>Elder Dongyang chuckled and shook his head slightly. “If you didn’t know the way out, would you be at ease, Lady Chen Yan? How could I force you? You and your master are not cultivators of the Small Cold Territory.  Your presence here is merely accidental. With your strength and background, after you rescue your master, there should be nothing left for you in the Small Cold Territory. You have resided on Mount Shaohua for two hundred years. I have never mistreated you, not only gathering cultivation resources for you but also helping you search for your master. What reason do you have to betray me?”</p><p>Chen Yan was silent for a moment. “After leaving the Violet Mist Palace, I will swear a heart demon oath not to reveal the secret passage to anyone, including my master.”</p><p>“That would be best!”</p><p>Elder Dongyang nodded, and with the purple cloud, flew deeper into the passage.</p><p>Chen Yan quickly followed.</p><p>The journey was smooth, encountering no obstructive formations or battles. The five on the purple cloud sat steadily, carried along.</p><p>The passage had been thoroughly cleaned, not even debris remained.</p><p>After many twists and turns, a wall of green bricks suddenly appeared, completely blocking the path.</p><p>Elder Dongyang glanced at Chen Yan and, in her presence, cast several hand seals into the wall.  Ripples like water appeared on the wall, shimmering and becoming almost transparent, turning into a wall of water.</p><p>On the other side of the water wall was a dilapidated hall, silent and empty.</p><p>Chen Yan and Elder Dongyang passed through the water wall and appeared in the hall. Looking back, the water wall vanished, replaced by the weathered green brick wall.</p><p>The brick wall looked ordinary, giving no hint of the hidden passage.</p><p>Exiting the hall.</p><p>Thick clouds obscured the sun, limiting visibility.</p><p>Their current location seemed to be the peak of the Heavenly Mountains, deep within the sea of clouds, yet the surroundings were calm, with no turbulence in the air above.</p><p>It was vastly different from other areas of the Violet Mist Palace.</p><p>Similar buildings to the hall they had just exited were arranged neatly nearby. Ancient palaces stood in rows. In such a place, no one would notice anything unusual about a single wall.</p><p>The depths of the sea of clouds were shadowy and mysterious.</p><p>Neither Elder Dongyang nor Chen Yan were curious about this place. After a brief observation, they flew upwards with a clear goal.</p><p>There were some areas they dared not trespass, forcing them to detour.</p><p>The higher they went, the grander the palaces became. Though the ornate decorations had withered, the structures themselves remained, exuding an air of majesty.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>Elder Dongyang pointed ahead.</p><p>A pool came into view within the thick clouds. The pavilion that should have been at the edge was severely damaged, with rubble scattered everywhere, a sorry sight.</p><p>Across the pool stood a tall, small tower.</p><p>The tower was a hundred feet high, entirely black, its surface seemingly exuding a black aura that appeared to absorb even one’s gaze, quite eerie.</p><p>Four exceptionally thick iron chains extended from the top of the tower to the ground, seemingly anchoring it. The chains were rusted, weathered by time, and covered in incomprehensible runes.</p><p>No ancient palaces surrounded the black tower; it stood alone.</p><p>Seeing the black tower, Chen Yan's normally calm eyes filled with intense excitement.</p><p>Elder Dongyang and Chen Yan flew across the pool and landed before the tower’s door.</p><p>Chen Yan walked forward alone, reaching out to gently caress the door, feeling its coldness, then looked up, her gaze traveling up the tower to its peak.</p><p>Elder Dongyang watched Chen Yan, then spoke.</p><p>“Lady Chen Yan, now you see how powerful the restrictions on this door are. I didn’t lie to you.</p><p>“The higher you go, the stronger the restrictions become.</p><p>“Your master is an anomaly. Currently, even the combined forces of the Small Cold Territory and the Heavenly Alliance have no late Nascent Soul cultivators. Only he has the strength to ascend the tower alone.</p><p>“Even if we use the Five Elements Beast Seal, we'd need at least two Nascent Soul cultivators to have a chance of opening that door. So, to rescue him, you must break through to Nascent Soul.</p><p>“You shouldn’t blame me now, for pushing you back then, should you?”</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Dongyang’s gaze swept seemingly casually over Qin Sang, a strange smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the purple cloud, his senses still sealed, unaware of all this.</p><p>Chen Yan detected something in Elder Dongyang’s words. She abruptly turned, her expression darkening, and stared at him. “I take responsibility for my own actions! I made my own choices and won’t, nor should I, blame others. What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“It’s good that Lady Chen Yan doesn’t blame me. I’m just afraid that if you can’t resolve your inner conflicts, it will become a heart demon, and that would be my fault… I misspoke.”</p><p>Elder Dongyang chuckled, saying no more. He flicked a finger, dispersing the purple cloud and forcibly unsealing Qin Sang and the others’ senses.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others fell to the ground. With their senses restored, they quickly steadied themselves and eagerly looked around.</p><p>Both the ancient palaces in the misty sea and the black tower before them held great allure.</p>
