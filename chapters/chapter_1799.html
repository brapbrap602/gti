<h1>Chapter 1790: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>Golden light, like a river bursting its banks, surged forward with an irresistible momentum.  It was clear that the golden light was definitely related to the Demon Marquises.</p><p>They had been pursuing relentlessly, their speed considerable, and the distance to the center of the golden eruption wasn't far. When they noticed the anomaly, the auspicious clouds ahead had already been tinged with a pale gold, which was rapidly spreading.</p><p>Bathed in a layer of golden light, Qin Sang felt no discomfort.</p><p>To everyone's spiritual perception, the golden light didn't exhibit much destructive power, only a grand and imposing aura.</p><p>But they soon realized the problem. The illusory scenes impacted by the golden light, especially those formed by the divine abilities of ancient mighty figures, began to show signs of instability.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Intense blue light erupted from the edge of the golden light.</p><p>It was the blue sea of light mentioned by Youhuang Zhenren. For some unknown reason, layers of light waves surged outward, spewing blue light and pushing back the golden light. The intersection of blue and gold created another wondrous spectacle.</p><p>After countless years of transformation, these illusory scenes restrained and overlapped each other, with the auspicious clouds acting as a buffer and connection, forming a stable structure. Even powerful Nascent Soul cultivators could only navigate through the layers of illusions formed by divine abilities, adapting to the changing circumstances.</p><p>Even with their full strength, it would be extremely difficult for them to shake these illusions.  Just like in the previous rain of soldier-forming beans, Qin Sang and the others could only continuously slay the mud figures, unable to find the root cause, let alone break the divine ability.</p><p>But now, the golden light seemed to shake the foundation of this space.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Dazzling spheres of light continuously erupted ahead, like the most brilliant fireworks in the world.</p><p>These spheres of light, each with a distinct color and carrying unique energy fluctuations, some gentle, some forceful, some violent like fire, some warm like the wind, impacted their surroundings, causing even greater chaos.</p><p>The chaos spread outward at an alarming rate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was already approaching them.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Everyone echoed Zhang Zhenren's cry of alarm.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren had ascended the stone platform, and all four of them were standing on the cloud path.</p><p>The cloud path was narrow, barely providing enough space for four people to cast talismans.</p><p>The stone platform was to their left, while two illusory scenes were pressed close to them on their right.</p><p>One was a ball of reddish-yellow threads, so fine they resembled faint clouds, easily mistaken for auspicious clouds if not observed carefully.</p><p>Beside the threads was a fissure, like a ferocious beast hidden in a spatial rift, revealing only its gaping maw as it continuously devoured the thread ball.</p><p>The devouring was endless, and so were the threads.</p><p>Similar illusory scenes existed before and after the stone platform. Some were clearly formed by divine abilities, while others were of unknown origin. If these erupted, their position in the middle would be perilous.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren roared.</p><p>The four of them were the first to retreat.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren on the stone platform abruptly stopped. It was impossible to complete the formation before the golden light arrived.</p><p>This wasn't the time for formation setting either. Both were well-versed in the art of making difficult choices and unhesitatingly abandoned the formation disk, flashing towards the edge of the stone platform.</p><p>However, as soon as they moved, the stone platform trembled violently, and a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Lines suddenly appeared on the previously mirror-smooth surface of the platform. Dense and intricate lines covered the stone platform, resembling an incredibly complex talismanic diagram.</p><p>Everyone present was deeply versed in talismanic arts. As they retreated, the talismanic diagram on the stone platform caught their eyes, triggering their talisman cultivator instincts, but they felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p>The stone platform didn't give them a chance to continue their contemplation. As soon as the talismanic diagram appeared, a powerful wave of energy erupted from it.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren hadn't managed to withdraw and bore the brunt of the impact. In their haste, they could only summon their protective treasures. A tremendous roar resounded as an astonishing force slammed into them from below.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and the others watched in horror as the two Zhenren were swept away by the wave emanating from the stone platform.  Judging by their reactions, they could only barely protect themselves, powerless against that force.</p><p>The distance between the two Zhenren and them rapidly increased, and they vanished into the golden light one after another, without even having time to leave a word.</p><p>The stone platform continued to emanate power, instantly causing widespread chaos in the surrounding area.</p><p>The power surged into the cloud-like threads, causing a large chunk to cave in, immediately triggering a counterattack. Threads shot out in all directions. If anyone were standing nearby, they would instantly be riddled with transparent holes.</p><p>Similar scenes occurred one after another. The golden light triggered a chain reaction of anomalies, spreading too quickly for Qin Sang and the others to escape.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest as he was also struck by the residual wave of the stone platform's talismanic diagram and sent flying backward.</p><p>He had already cast the Golden Light Celestial Armor Seal and wasn't injured.</p><p>But as he retreated, Qin Sang caught sight of changes on both sides from the corner of his eye, and the Celestial Eye Butterfly also sent a warning.</p><p>The illusory scenes on both sides were expanding. If they collided, the consequences were unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  He made a decisive move, charging towards the illusory scene on his right.</p><p>He had just entered the illusion and hadn't yet seen what lay within when he suddenly heard a piercing wind sound. A premonition of danger surged within him, and he instinctively thrust a palm towards his right rear.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang twisted his body, but neither he nor the Celestial Eye Butterfly saw anything.  Only his palm felt a gentle force, pushing him involuntarily outwards.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang was pushed out of the illusion and found himself in an unfamiliar place, unable to see Youhuang Zhenren and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang could only ensure his own safety, with no time to worry about the others. Besides, they surely had their own life-saving methods.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The sound of water came from above.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't even glance upward, instead, darting straight ahead.</p><p>At this moment, chaotic scenes were everywhere, above, below, left, and right. He felt as if he were within a brightly colored canvas.</p><p>Seeking a safe haven within the chaos was impossible. He could only continuously maneuver and dodge, testing his eyesight and strength.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly helped Qin Sang find a way out, allowing him to focus on dealing with the dangers.</p><p>Now the benefits of his improved Celestial Eye divine ability were evident; even the most fleeting openings couldn't escape the butterfly's notice.</p><p>Man and butterfly were in perfect harmony. With the Celestial Eye Butterfly's aid, Qin Sang weaved through various anomalies, sometimes casting the Lotus Flower Seal, sometimes flapping his phoenix wings, sometimes summoning his Spiritwood Body to charge forward. He danced on the edge of a knife, a sight that would make anyone watching break into a cold sweat.</p><p>His situation seemed precarious.</p><p>However, as time passed, Qin Sang realized that the chaos caused by the golden light wasn't as severe as he had imagined.</p><p>This space was still stable, far from collapsing. The ancient divine abilities hadn't been truly activated; only the residual waves stirred up by the golden light continued to wreak havoc.</p><p>As long as Nascent Soul cultivators responded appropriately, their lives wouldn't be in danger, though they might suffer some hardship.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.  He tried to locate the others but found that they had all disappeared.</p><p>The situation had been too chaotic earlier, and Qin Sang couldn't even recall the location of the stone platform.  He remembered the communication talismans they had prepared before entering and took one out, activating it.</p><p>The talisman transformed into a talismanic seal in his palm, its light fluctuating before slowly dissipating.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. The talisman was useless here.</p><p>The anomaly had erupted so suddenly that they hadn't had time to agree on a meeting point.</p><p>Where should he go next?</p><p>Should he search for the Demon Marquises alone, or leave this place and wait for the others at the Golden Hall?</p><p>Another worry lingered.  He didn't know how long this situation would last or if there would be another, more violent eruption of golden light.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed blue light flickering ahead. His heart stirred as he recalled the blue sea of light.</p><p>On their way here, Youhuang Zhenren had spoken of her experiences in this place, and Qin Sang had listened carefully, committing it all to memory.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren had explored most of the illusory scenes along the route she had taken and knew where the dangers lay and which areas were relatively safe.</p><p>As long as he found that route, even if further anomalies occurred, he wouldn't be caught off guard.</p><p>Judging by the scenery ahead, he had already reached the vicinity of the blue sea of light.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang immediately transmitted his thoughts to the Celestial Eye Butterfly, searching for a path towards the blue sea of light.</p><p>Like a wave-rider cleaving through the surf, Qin Sang reached the edge of the blue sea of light without any significant mishap.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, a scene of azure blue unfolded.</p><p>According to Youhuang Zhenren, the blue sea of light had been calm before, like a pure blue wall of light. Gazing at it, one's mind would involuntarily become immersed, experiencing an unprecedented tranquility.</p><p>It was originally a good thing, but Youhuang Zhenren discovered that after staring at the blue sea of light for a while, circular ripples would appear, gradually spreading as if to draw her in.  This had alerted her, instilling a sense of inexplicable fear, and she dared not look any longer.</p><p>The current blue sea of light was slightly distorted, but overall, it remained relatively stable.</p><p>Qin Sang avoided looking directly at the sea of light, moving along its edge, searching for illusory scenes that matched Youhuang Zhenren's descriptions.</p><p>Along the way, he tried several times to contact his companions with talismans, but they all vanished without a trace.</p><p>As he flew, a fierce wind rushed towards him, bringing with it a vast, shadowy form of black sand.</p><p>The black sand shadow exuded an aura of decay. Qin Sang frowned slightly, unwilling to let such a bizarre thing touch him. He immediately changed direction, moving sideways.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The black sand swept past, clearing a path. Qin Sang flashed back, about to seize the opportunity to charge forward when he suddenly saw a black streak of light shooting from the edge of the path ahead.</p><p>Before the streak of light arrived, the Celestial Eye Butterfly relayed the image within it – a person!</p><p>The newcomer was a lean young man clad in black armor. The armor plates were scale-like, incredibly fine and dense, covering every part of his body except his hands, feet, and head, as if they were growing from his skin.</p><p>When Qin Sang saw the scaled, pointed tail behind the newcomer, his pupils constricted abruptly.  The newcomer was a demon!</p><p>Here, no one could conceal their aura.  The moment the Celestial Eye Butterfly detected the other party, the other party also sensed Qin Sang.</p><p>The escaping light rushed into the path and stopped abruptly, revealing the black-armored youth.</p><p>The demon had thin, pointed cheeks and small but incredibly sharp eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. He had already sensed the other party's aura – Mid-Nascent Soul!</p><p>Comparable to Zhang Zhenren!</p><p>If it were an Early-Nascent Soul Demon Marquis, Qin Sang believed he had a good chance of slaying it, completing the mission and directly withdrawing from the Ju Shan Ritual Altar.</p><p>Facing a Mid-Nascent Soul Great Demon, even after consuming the True Fixation Pill, Qin Sang wasn't very confident.</p><p>Repelling and slaying were two different concepts.  If he couldn't eliminate the opponent, there would be no merit, only a pointless battle.</p><p>In the event of mutual injury, it would be even more disadvantageous for him.</p><p>The black-armored youth stared at Qin Sang, a cruel smile appearing on his lips. "Was it you who was chasing after this Marquis just now?"</p><p>These Demon Marquises clearly had hidden methods. Qin Sang and the others were discovered as soon as they entered the Nine-Bend Star River.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the black armor on the demon's chest. He recalled the information he had reviewed earlier. This demon should be Li Hou, one of the Demon Marquises of the Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>Compared to the other Demon Marquises with illustrious battle records, Li Hou was less renowned, but this was because he rarely appeared on the battlefield. No one dared underestimate a Mid-Nascent Soul Great Demon.</p><p>Li Hou's eyes flashed with a cold light, clearly realizing that Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to his own. Killing intent arose within him.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. Without replying, a pair of wings suddenly appeared behind him. With a powerful flap, he transformed into a bolt of lightning and fled to one side.</p><p>As he escaped, Qin Sang silently activated the Celestial Demon Transformation, releasing his pure demonic aura, and left behind a single sentence: "Li Hou, you misunderstand."</p><p>Sensing the exceptionally pure demonic aura, Li Hou couldn't help but pause, then sneered, his face filled with killing intent.</p><p>In this realm, the Daoist sects had developed many methods to feign demonic aura to combat the Guifang Kingdom. Although not as pure as what this person displayed, Li Hou had seen them often and wouldn't be fooled by such tricks.  Instead, his interest in Qin Sang piqued.</p><p>Moreover, even if this person truly was a demon cultivator, he didn't match any Demon Marquis he knew.  Appearing here now, he was definitely an enemy, not a friend.</p><p>Li Hou flicked his pointed tail, and a black light erupted from its tip, enveloping him as he pursued closely.</p><p>Man and demon, one in front, one behind, Li Hou pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The chaos hadn't subsided yet, and both had to avoid the surrounding dangers during their chase, preventing them from reaching their full speed.</p><p>Li Hou followed Qin Sang closely, wearing him down while waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>It seemed that Li Hou had also been thrown out by the golden light. Unfortunately, the demon showed no signs of injury. He wondered what they had actually experienced.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang repeatedly tried to contact his companions with talismans, but there was still no response.</p><p>Li Hou observed this, a sneer playing on his lips. He had already confirmed that before the golden light receded, any means of communication would be ineffective.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He wasn't afraid of the opponent but didn't want a pointless battle.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. He suddenly recalled the jungle illusion that Youhuang Zhenren had mentioned.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren had gathered spirit flowers there, and after consuming them, she had experienced real medicinal effects.</p><p>Perhaps, the jungle there was real.</p><p>As long as there was abundant wood spirit energy, he could take advantage of the terrain and fight Li Hou using his Spiritwood Body, then decide his next course of action based on the situation.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately formed a plan. Maintaining his speed, he continued flying along the edge of the blue sea of light.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Li Hou finally found an opportunity to strike.</p><p>A claw shadow lunged straight for the back of Qin Sang's head. However, Qin Sang seemed to have anticipated this. His figure flickered, skillfully using the power of an illusion to neutralize the claw shadow.</p><p>Li Hou frowned. This person's movement techniques and spiritual sense were both quite strong, and he seemed intent on escaping.  A swift victory would be impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to evade Li Hou, feigning distress while secretly searching for the path.  His efforts were rewarded when he finally found an illusory scene that Youhuang Zhenren had mentioned.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression and demeanor remained unchanged as he subtly altered his direction of escape.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang stepped onto the path Youhuang Zhenren had once taken.  Before long, he finally found his target!</p>
