Chapter 357: No Destiny


"You did well!"


Qin Sang didn't have much affection for the Qin family, but having taken over Qin Sanwa's body and inherited this karmic debt, for peace of mind, she asked Wu Chuanzong to take care of Qin Sanwa's immediate family.


Wu Chuanzong, however, treated Qin Sang's words as a sacred edict, elevating the Qin family from humble farmers to a prominent clan—he couldn't have done better.


Qin Sang had intended to meet with old friends and leave, but seeing Wu Chuanzong's reluctance and Mrs. Wu's hesitant expression, recalling her past quest for immortality, she said solemnly, "As you heard earlier, cultivating immortality isn't as wonderful as imagined. I'm preoccupied and unable to take on disciples. I can only send them to a relatively safe place for self-cultivation.  If any of the Wu family descendants aspire to the immortal path, you may send them to me; I will assess their aptitude.  Of course, the final decision to pursue immortality rests with them."


She lacked the time and ability to protect them.


Even if some of these descendants possessed spiritual roots, she could at most guide them to Hanjia Fort; their future achievements would depend entirely on themselves.


Hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang added, "The Qin and Bai family descendants in the capital can also be summoned."


After instructing Wu Chuanzong to gather the descendants, Qin Sang pondered for a while, then took out a piece of jade and carved it into several pendants.


At 4 AM.


A commotion suddenly erupted in the Grand Tutor's mansion.


A dozen or so young men and women were abruptly pulled from their sleep. Initially grumbling, they were astonished to find themselves in the Grand Tutor's mansion and became excitedly chatty.


"The Grand Tutor summoned us in the dead of night! No wonder my parents were so anxious…"


"I wonder what urgent matter requires this late-night summons? Did Grandfather notice our talents and intend to employ us?"


"Why only the descendants of our three families?"


"Brother Qin's military and political strategies must have impressed the Grand Tutor. Congratulations, Brother Qin…"


…


"Sir, everyone is here."


Wu Chuanzong approached the door, whispering his report, but receiving no reply, his face changed, and he hastily pushed the door open.


He saw flickering candlelight in the room, but the person was gone.


On the table lay a jade bottle and three white jade pendants.


Suddenly, Qin Sang's voice echoed in his ears.


"Chuanzong, these descendants lack spiritual roots and have no destiny with the immortal path; it may not be a bad thing.


"Give this bottle of pills to Shuihouzi for me. I won't go see him.


"These jade pendants bear my prohibitions. Each of your three families will receive one. In the event of a family annihilation, drop your blood on the pendant to activate its power and save your family from disaster.


"Remember, this item can only be used once and will be destroyed afterward. Only those with the bloodline of your three families can activate the prohibition. Do not use it for evil deeds. Consider it my final assistance.


"Chuanzong, this parting may be our last. Take good care of yourself…"


The voice faded, becoming increasingly distant.


"Sir!"


Wu Chuanzong wept on the ground, then suddenly remembered something, hastily raising his head to shout into the void, "Sir! Before the late Emperor passed, he left an edict: the coffin will not enter the imperial mausoleum but will be buried in Mount Sacred! The late Emperor was diligent in his governance, lived a frugal life, never married, and had no descendants. He once said that the one who could win his love must be a remarkable man with the same unwavering resolve…"


After a long silence, a soft sigh came from the void, "I understand…"


A look of relief appeared on Wu Chuanzong's face as he slumped to the ground.


…


Mount Sacred.


This royal sacred mountain was rumored to be a place where immortals resided.


The mountain's forbidden areas were off-limits.


Behind Mount Sacred, a nameless stele stood alone.


The mountain was a thousand feet high, seeming to touch the sun and moon.


From this place, one could overlook the capital and gaze at the heavens, seemingly facing an immortal.


Suddenly, a figure appeared on the path before the nameless stele.  It was unknown how he bypassed the numerous guards.  He carried a wine flask in one hand and a cup in the other, walking step by step to the stele.


He stood motionless before the stele for a long time.


The visitor was Qin Sang.


Recalling that night before his departure, his audacious use of Mount Sacred as a metaphor to express his aspirations for immortality, Qin Sang murmured, "You still remember… Luckily, I haven't forgotten either. Otherwise, how could I face you?"


He opened the bottle; the fragrance of the wine filled the air. The immortal brew, Green Rainbow Wine, truly lived up to its reputation.


Qin Sang poured a cup of wine, placing it before the nameless stele.  She whispered, “To you! Congratulations on fulfilling your dream, ascending to the throne as Empress, and becoming a legend… The path to immortality is harder than I imagined, but I won’t give up. I hope you’ll bless me from beyond the grave…”

Qin Sang took a large swig from the wine flask.  She found that even with her spiritual energy sealed within her dantian, her Foundation Establishment-stage body could easily withstand the alcohol.

She rose and began to walk back.

At first, her steps were heavy, but soon she strode with long, confident strides.

A gentle breeze accompanied her, the moon her sole companion.

…

Mount Cui Ming.

Dawn had broken, and many devotees were already ascending the mountain to offer incense and prayers.

The baozi shop from San Wu City was still there; the current owner was the grandson of the former owner, naturally not recognizing Qin Sang.  The meat buns were as delicious as ever, and Qin Sang enjoyed a hearty meal before reaching Mount Cui Ming and finding a secluded spot to reveal her true form.

Following the familiar mountain path, she climbed the steps.  To her surprise, the Qingyang Temple had been completely renovated.

The stone lintel inscribed with ‘Qingyang Temple’ remained, though the characters had been freshly painted, and the old, crooked wooden doors had been replaced.

Curiosity piqued, Qin Sang entered the temple.  At a glance, she saw that the layout hadn't changed much, but the halls and walls were newly built with blue bricks, indicating that the temple was far more prosperous than before.

Just then, a peasant farmer helped an old woman out of the Qingyang Hall, repeatedly turning back to thank the Taoist priest.

The scene felt strangely familiar.

However, their clothes, though clean, were simple; they weren’t wealthy, but they weren’t dressed in rags like famine victims, nor were they running up debts.

On her journey, Qin Sang had only glimpsed the current state of the Sui Dynasty, but it was clearly vastly different from decades ago. The Empress had governed well, and the empire was thriving.

Qin Sang wore a simple, long robe, a magical artifact. Its spiritual light was subtle, but the material was clearly exceptional.  Combined with her composed demeanor, it was clear she wasn't an ordinary person.

The mother and son, fearful of offending her, carefully made their way out. Before leaving the temple, they glanced back at Qin Sang with a hint of apprehension.

Qin Sang noticed their subtle movements and understood their fear—they worried she might harm the temple.

It seemed the temple’s Taoist priest was well-loved.

Qin Sang eagerly approached the Qingyang Hall and pushed open the doors, only to be met with disappointment.

As before, many patients sat quietly waiting to be seen.

However, instead of the old Taoist priest, a young man, perhaps twenty years old, was attending to them.

Mingyue was not there.
