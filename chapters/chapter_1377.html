<h1>Chapter 1369: Planning the Dao Path</h1><p>The Jade Buddha could not respond to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the unwavering Buddha light, helpless.</p><p>He recalled his three experiences entering the Purple Micro Palace, and had not noticed anything unusual about the Jade Buddha.</p><p>"Sword Spirit..."</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that he still had a living being brought out from the Purple Micro Palace—the Killing Sword Sword Spirit!</p><p>The Killing Sword Sword Spirit possessed independent consciousness and might know the inside story of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Perhaps he could use the Purple Micro Palace to peek into the origins of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang was even more eager to find the Killing Sword fragments and awaken the Sword Spirit.</p><p>…</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley, grotto-mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang woke up from his meditation, slowly opened his eyes, his True Essence slightly stirred, then subsided, his whole aura profound, without the slightest ripple.</p><p>"Well, my cultivation has stabilized."</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, glanced at his dantian, his eyes not showing complacency, but solemnity.</p><p>"There are no shortcuts later on; relying on one's own cultivation is indeed difficult. In fact, my cultivation speed is already not slow, no wonder Grand Cultivators are so rare..."</p><p>Qin Sang knew very well that he couldn't rush later on, and might as well go out for a journey , since he was still young anyway.</p><p>He still had more than two hundred years before his first Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>With his cultivation, the first Heavenly Tribulation was not worth worrying about, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>After thinking it over.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, nowadays, if he wanted to improve himself as soon as possible, painstaking cultivation was not the way, he could only set his sights on other Divine Abilities.</p><p>Over the years, due to focusing on cultivation, he had no time to attend to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, both of which had stagnated.</p><p>*Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* was still far from breaking through the mid-stage of the fourth level.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang, after weighing it, almost shelved *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, and his progress was exceptionally slow. He could pick up body refinement later.</p><p>However, Qin Sang planned to focus his main energy on cultivating *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* first, and break through the second level as soon as possible.</p><p>The cultivation art describes that after *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* breaks through the second level, the cultivator's Divine Sense will undergo a leap, and the benefits are obvious.</p><p>His own Divine Sense was already not weak now.</p><p>Optimistically estimated, after the breakthrough, he could materialize his Divine Sense, reaching a level comparable to that of a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>Back then, Old Devil Mu only had at most two levels, yet he was able to escape the siege of both the righteous and demonic paths, and play dead under the eyes of the Ancient Demon's separated soul, which showed how strong his Divine Sense was.</p><p>Qin Sang's ambition was certainly not limited to this.</p><p>Cultivating essence, qi, and spirit concurrently is beneficial to forming the Nascent Soul, and will certainly be no exception when breaking through to the next realm, or even transforming into a God .</p><p>Taking one step at a time, laying a solid foundation, can accumulate strength for a later surge.</p><p>And he had the capital!</p><p>Having planned his future cultivation path, Qin Sang summoned the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed was like a physical entity.</p><p>It needed to continuously refine the Netherworld Demonic Fire, reaching a qualitative change to break through.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Demonic Banner and tried to refine the Demonic Fire, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the cultivation speed was faster than when he was in the early stage of the Nascent Soul, and the time spent could be greatly shortened.</p><p>Without anyone to learn from, Qin Sang didn't know how long it would take to see results.</p><p>He could also refine the Demonic Fire while traveling , without having to stay in the grotto-mansion.</p><p>After refining a wisp of Demonic Fire, Qin Sang contentedly stopped his exercise and tried to cultivate *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* again.</p><p>An increase in realm also helps body refinement, but he must cultivate hard himself, and the time to break through will definitely be much later than *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned his magical treasures, the Wandering Cloud Sword and the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>The Wandering Cloud Sword had not changed, still in the shape of a sword embryo.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully probed it with his Divine Sense, sensed the weak True Spirit, and after careful induction, a wry smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>So many years had passed, but he could not feel the True Spirit growing in the slightest.</p><p>Nurturing spirituality and refining a Spiritual Treasure is indeed a long and difficult process! Qin Sang didn't know which would come first, his breakthrough to the late stage of the Nascent Soul or the Wandering Cloud Sword's advancement.</p><p>"As long as I can successfully nurture the True Spirit of my predecessor, it's worth waiting as long as it takes."</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the sword embryo, his gaze shifted, and he looked at the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>The change in the Solar Divine Tree was very significant.</p><p>The moment he took out this magical treasure, the entire grotto-mansion was illuminated, and Qin Sang's face was radiant.</p><p>The Solar Divine Tree was completely red, more dazzling than before, like a ball of fire, increasingly like the legendary Fusang Divine Tree. Around the divine tree, the air appeared in bursts of distortion, exuding an incomparably blazing wave.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang did not dare to try to subdue the Southern Bright Fire with the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and there was no need to.</p><p>He would talk about it after refining the Netherworld Demonic Fire.</p><p>What Qin Sang was concerned about was the power of flames on the nine flower buds of the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>Different from the main body, these flame powers shrank into a ball, becoming dark red and restrained, not so dazzling, but even more daunting.</p><p>Qin Sang stretched out his hand, carefully holding the Solar Divine Tree, and carefully observed it for a long time.</p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The magical treasure had not escaped his control, and was changing in the direction he expected.</p><p>When these flame powers condensed to the extreme and became nine divine birds, then the magical treasure and the Southern Bright Fire would stabilize and be available for his use.</p><p>The Solar Divine Tree should complete its transformation earlier than Yun Youzi, and its power was worth looking forward to!</p><p>With these treasures in hand, he would not have to fear encountering strong enemies in the future, nor would he have to rack his brains to find other magical treasures. He could concentrate on cultivation, as well as searching for the Killing Sword fragments and the Reception Platform.</p><p>After putting away the magical treasures, Qin Sang summoned the three spirit insects and the mute girl.</p><p>The Fire Melt Pill was continuously supplied, and the Fire Jade Centipede was feasting on it. It had broken through to the mid-stage of the third transformation twenty years ago, and the late stage was just around the corner.</p><p>Unfortunately, unless it encountered a great opportunity, it was difficult for the Fire Jade Centipede to advance.</p><p>The potential of the Skyeye Butterfly was definitely far greater than that of the Fire Jade Centipede, but its improvement speed was too slow.</p><p>Qin Sang had tasted the benefits of the Natal Gu Insect, and of course wanted to improve the Skyeye Butterfly as soon as possible. He had already tried everything, but the results were minimal.</p><p>This time when he went to the Northern Sea Three Realms, he would also look for secret arts of Insect Manipulation.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was sound asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention to it was no less than that of the Skyeye Butterfly, but this guy was even more picky than the Skyeye Butterfly, and when the poisonous algae fruit was eaten up, it could only go hungry.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was the mute girl's Natal Gu Insect, and there was a layer between him and it.</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea how to help the Fat Silkworm advance, so he could only take it one step at a time.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger to wake up the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm forgot the pain when it saw food, swallowed the poisonous algae fruit in one gulp, turned over its belly, and continued to sleep soundly.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, his gaze falling on the mute girl.</p><p>According to Bai's guidance, Qin Sang had engraved several bone curses on the mute girl's arm. Whether it was the effect of the bone curses, or that she was sleeping with the Natal Gu Insect and had received some benefits.</p><p>The mute girl's condition was getting better and better.</p><p>Her aura was complete, her cheeks were rosy, and other than being asleep, she was no different from ordinary people.</p><p>Even more surprising was that the mute girl's Nascent Soul was surrounded by seven-colored light, like a light cocoon, wrapping her up, adding a bit of mysterious color.</p><p>Qin Sang could not understand what the light was for.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the mutation must have come from the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>It was just that he didn't know whether it was the Fat Silkworm's unique ability, or whether it was brought about by actively recognizing its master.</p>
