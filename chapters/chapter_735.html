<h1>Chapter 727: Thundercloud</h1><p>A thin layer of restriction covered the Winter Netherflame.</p><p>Within the restriction, traces of Nine Nether Demonic Fire flickered, emitting a faint grayish-black aura. However, it couldn't conceal the pure, deep blue brilliance of the Winter Netherflame.  Qinsang held the flame in his hand and cautiously extended a wisp of divine sense, piercing through the restriction.</p><p>A flash of blue light erupted from within the Winter Netherflame, and Qinsang instantly lost contact with his divine sense. It had been effortlessly extinguished by the flame.</p><p>A helpless expression crossed Qinsang's face.</p><p>This wasn't his first attempt over the past few months. Each had ended similarly, leaving him clueless about how to subdue the Winter Netherflame.</p><p>“Is crafting a single-use tool like the Void Thunder really the only option?”</p><p>Qinsang muttered to himself.</p><p>Being a skilled craftsman, his first instinct was to find a solution through crafting. After days of contemplation, he realized that by utilizing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to forcefully compress the Winter Netherflame, he might be able to condense it into a fire pearl.</p><p>If refined into a fire pearl, the flame's power would erupt instantaneously. Its might would surely surpass the Void Thunder, and few below the Nascent Soul stage could likely withstand it. The drawback was that it, too, could only be used once.</p><p>“Such a rare flame… condensing it into a single-use fire pearl seems like such a waste.  Besides, condensing it into a pearl isn't that simple either. I'd need to at least reach the mid-stage of Core Formation before attempting it.”</p><p>Qinsang hesitated, feeling reluctant.</p><p>After a few more attempts, the Winter Netherflame remained unyielding. Qinsang stored it away once more.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Oriole Island.</p><p>The island derived its name from a small bird called the Green Oriole, a harmless creature beloved by all.</p><p>Green Oriole Island was one of those small islands without a Nascent Soul cultivator guarding it. While it had a protective formation, it appeared fragile against demonic tides.  As Qinsang walked along the streets of Green Oriole Island, he noticed the crude stone houses and chambers lining both sides.</p><p>After exploring Green Oriole Island, Qinsang acquired the most detailed nautical chart of the surrounding area, easily pinpointing Redleaf Island's location.  He then left the island alone.</p><p>Redleaf Island lay east of Green Oriole Island.</p><p>Small islands like these didn't have many cultivators, and the explored sea area around them was limited.  Redleaf Island happened to be outside this range, and its surrounding waters, teeming with demonic beasts, were a place the inhabitants of Green Oriole Island spoke of with fear.</p><p>Once a certain distance from Green Oriole Island and out of sight of other cultivators, Qinsang released the Two-Headed Serpent.  Man and beast sped across the sea, heading straight for Redleaf Island.</p><p>Redleaf Island was quite far from Green Oriole Island. It took Qinsang and the Two-Headed Serpent over half a month to reach it. He wondered what treasure that Wu tribe warrior sought to venture so deep.</p><p>As they neared Redleaf Island, even someone as powerful as Qinsang didn't dare to be careless.</p><p>Disturbing the demonic beasts here wasn't a matter of a few, but of waves upon waves. These beasts traveled in packs, and a single disturbance could instantly trigger a small beast tide, trapping him here.</p><p>After putting the Two-Headed Serpent away, Qinsang took out the map, concealed himself, constantly monitored the Primordial Harmony Ring, and advanced cautiously.</p><p>He hadn't gone far when the Yin Ring within his body began to vibrate incessantly.</p><p>The density of demonic beasts here surpassed even the Thousand Demon Sea, astonishing Qinsang.</p><p>Fortunately, the Primordial Harmony Ring hadn't detected any Demon Core realm demonic beasts. The lesser demons couldn't see through Qinsang's concealment, allowing him to move forward with relative ease.</p><p>But this didn't last.  Not long after, the Yin Ring vibrated intensely. Qinsang's expression changed slightly, and he had to detour.</p><p>A journey that should have taken half a day stretched into a full day and night. Only by late night did he finally see the shadow of Redleaf Island. No wonder the Wu tribe warrior had spoken of Redleaf Island with such apprehension.</p><p>Hidden beneath the water's surface, he observed Redleaf Island from afar.</p><p>Redleaf Island wasn't large. Ancient trees covered the island, their leaves a fiery red. Under the cold moon, the red leaves formed a continuous expanse, like a crimson cloud floating on the sea.</p><p>Mist perpetually shrouded the base of the ancient trees, creating an ethereal scene of layered crimson clouds and a sea of mist.</p><p>"Good fortune.  No sign of demonic beasts."</p><p>Qinsang reached the edge of Redleaf Island, cautiously surveying his surroundings, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Upon landing, he discovered that not a single blade of grass grew on Redleaf Island.  The only vegetation was the red-leaved ancient trees.  The island was silent, devoid of insects or beasts.</p><p>As he entered the forest, Qinsang grew even more vigilant. The mist on the island wasn't poisonous, but incredibly thick, obscuring his vision.  His divine sense could only penetrate a short distance.</p><p>Recalling the Wu tribe warrior's instructions, Qinsang looked around, adjusted his direction slightly, and headed straight for the depths of Redleaf Island.</p><p>Walking among the ancient trees, he found the ground covered in sharp, upward-pointing stone shards.</p><p>This terrain, perhaps carved by the sea, was riddled with crevices from which the white mist continuously emanated.  The roots of the ancient trees burrowed deep into these crevices.</p><p>The journey remained peaceful. Qinsang soon arrived at his destination. Before him stood an exceptionally tall ancient tree, its mighty roots resembling giant pythons, the tallest reaching twice his height.</p><p>The roots intertwined, forming an umbrella-like root system.</p><p>Qinsang climbed atop the roots and searched. He eventually found a hollow between two dead roots, large enough for a person to pass through.</p><p>As the Wu tribe warrior had said, following this hollow would lead him to the Six-Petal Violet Butterfly Flower.</p><p>Mist also filled the hollow.  Qinsang released the Flying Night Devil, ordering it to lead the way, and had the Two-Headed Serpent guard the entrance before crawling in himself.</p><p>The ancient tree's root system was unimaginably complex and vast. The hollow twisted and turned, descending deep into the earth. Finally, the roots began to thin, replaced by stone walls.</p><p>Stone walls enclosed him on both sides, making the place resemble an underground canyon.</p><p>Suddenly, Qinsang paused, listening intently.  To his surprise, he heard the faint rumble of thunder ahead.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil in front remained unharmed. After a moment of hesitation, Qinsang continued forward.</p><p>The thunder grew louder, echoing through the underground passage.  Just as Qinsang frowned, he received a message from the Flying Night Devil. His expression brightened, and he quickened his pace.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Deep within Redleaf Island lay a vast underground cavern.</p><p>Qinsang and the Flying Night Devil landed on the water within, looking up.</p><p>The cavern itself was free of thick mist, but the mist had condensed into cloud-like formations at the top.  Even more peculiar, deep underground, lightning flickered within these cloud formations, thin bolts appearing and disappearing.</p><p>The lightning illuminated the cavern, making it easy to see. Qinsang's gaze swept across the area, and he spotted several familiar Six-Petal Violet Butterfly Flowers in the depths of the cavern.</p><p>The wondrous flowers were in full bloom, fully matured.</p><p>As Qinsang prepared to fly over and collect them, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, dormant within his Qi Sea, awakened for some unknown reason, eager to emerge.</p><p>It seemed to be drawn to the thunderclouds.</p>
