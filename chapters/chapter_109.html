<h1>Chapter 102 Leaving the Market (Seeking Subscription!)</h1><p>“Bang! Bang!”</p><p>Someone suddenly knocked on the courtyard gate. The master and servant, who were eating, both tensed.</p><p>Old Zhou was furious and abruptly stood up. “That hooligan is here again! I'll go fight him!”</p><p>Song Ying quickly stopped him. “Old Zhou, don't get angry. Just let him have his say. He wouldn't dare actually lay a hand on us commoners in the market.  Keep the gong handy. If he tries anything, we'll make sure he regrets it.”</p><p>Old Zhou pounded his chest. “But... Miss, your entire life will be ruined!”</p><p>Song Ying put on her veil. She knew the veil couldn't hide anything from a cultivator's eyes and had always been discreet, never wandering around. Yet, despite her caution, a cultivator had seen her true face and become infatuated, harassing her daily.</p><p>Fortunately, Mount Shaohua had strict rules, and Song Ying wasn't without connections. The man didn't dare to cross the line.</p><p>However, Song Ying knew this wasn't a long-term solution.  The difference between mortals and immortals was vast.  Even a low-level cultivator could easily deal with a mortal in countless ways.  So Song Ying endured, careful not to provoke him.</p><p>‘Creak.’</p><p>Song Ying opened the gate and was surprised to find the man standing at the entrance, looking remarkably composed.</p><p>Though he still reeked of alcohol, his eyes lacked their usual lasciviousness. He didn't utter any vulgar words, but instead bowed deeply and respectfully said, “Miss Song, I was blind before. Please forgive me and give me a chance to reform. I swear I will never appear before you again. Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning and die a miserable death!”</p><p>Song Ying was completely stunned, utterly baffled by the hooligan's sudden change of heart.</p><p>The man, after making his solemn vow, turned and bowed obsequiously to the side, carefully smiling. “Senior, is this acceptable?”</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the shadows.  His voice was deep. “Get lost. Don't let me see you again, or I'll skin you alive!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, I'll get lost right away, right away…”</p><p>The young man scrambled away, not daring to look back.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the bewildered Song Ying and asked gently, “Miss, you are Song Ying, right?”</p><p>Song Ying gripped the door ring tightly. “Indeed, Immortal. I am Song Ying.  Thank you for driving away that villain. I'm eternally grateful.”</p><p>She wasn't happy that the hooligan had been driven away, but rather more terrified. Someone who could make that hooligan so afraid… if they had any ill intentions, she was utterly defenseless.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Song Ying's fingers, white from her tight grip, and said with a smile, “Miss Song, don't be afraid. I mean you no harm. Song Hua saved my life. I came specifically to find you.”</p><p>“Song Hua, my brother!”</p><p>Song Ying gasped, forgetting her fear.  She stepped out, her face full of urgency. “Immortal, is my brother still alive? Where is he now?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.  “Miss Song, why don't we go inside and talk?”</p><p>…</p><p>The three sat facing each other.</p><p>Watching the old man and young woman embrace and weep, Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He held back very little information, as he didn't know much about Song Hua to begin with.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the seven-colored pouch and placed it on the table.  “This is Song Hua’s storage pouch. He saved my life and helped me escape danger. I swore I would return it to the Song family if I ever had the chance. There were originally eight spirit stones inside.  You won't be able to open the pouch, so I’ve separated them.  I can also help you retrieve the other items inside."</p><p>Qin Sang took out twenty more spirit stones and placed them on the table.</p><p>Song Hua's storage pouch was actually more advanced than those issued by the Kuiyin Sect and Yuanzhao Sect, with a larger space, but Qin Sang wasn't unwilling to part with them.</p><p>He had already memorized the "Song Family Sword Technique," and he returned it, along with the "Mysterious Yin Manual" and the Song family genealogy, to their rightful owner.</p><p>What impressed Qin Sang was that after weeping, Song Ying quickly suppressed her grief and regained her composure. She stared at the items on the table in silence for a long moment, then suddenly said to Old Zhou, “Old Zhou, it's getting late. Let me help you to bed.”</p><p>Watching Song Ying's retreating figure, Qin Sang was a little surprised. He pondered for a moment, then chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>“Immortal.”</p><p>Song Ying returned and sat down before Qin Sang, looking at him intently. “I wonder if you’ve read our Song family genealogy. My ancestor was originally a disciple of Mount Shaohua. For his meritorious service, the sect awarded him a Sword Intent Decree upon his departure.  Mount Shaohua decreed that any Song descendant possessing the Sword Intent Decree could directly join the sect. The decree is now in my ancestor's tomb.”</p><p>“Miss Song knows about the Sword Intent Decree?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, “What is the meaning of your words?”</p><p>Song Ying nodded. “My brother left in a hurry that day, only having time to leave me a letter.  He mentioned this secret and told me to remember it.”</p><p>I've been waiting for my elder brother's return, but now he's... I'm just a mortal, there's no point in keeping this secret any longer. I wonder if the Immortal would be interested in the Sword Intent Decree. If so, I'll retrieve it and offer it to you."</p><p>Qin Sang had come for precisely this. Hearing Song Ying's words, he knew she was exceptionally intelligent, and there was no need for pretense. He asked, "Miss Song, what are your requests?"</p><p>Song Ying seemed to have already formulated a plan.  She replied decisively, "I have only two requests. First, please take us away from Moon Inquiry City and help us settle down in a mortal kingdom below, to live a peaceful life. Second, if I ever have children with spiritual roots, please agree to take them as your disciples! We can establish a contract, with the city's steward as our witness."</p><p>These two requests surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>He had assumed Song Ying would ask him to help reclaim her family estate. He was already considering how to persuade her otherwise or promise to deal with the Li family when he was strong enough.</p><p>Unexpectedly, she wanted to leave Moon Inquiry City entirely. Once mortals leave, they can never return.</p><p>Song Ying gave a bitter smile. "Even if the Immortal helped me reclaim the estate, how could we, mere mortals, hold onto such a treasure? I've long since seen the truth: in the eyes of cultivators, mortals are no different from livestock. I possess martial arts skills; in the mortal world, I can at least protect myself and won't be bullied."</p><p>Some seek immortality in vain, while others fear it like a tiger.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and said solemnly, "Neither of these requests is difficult; I can agree to both. If your children truly possess talent, and I am fortunate enough to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, introducing them to Shaohua Mountain wouldn't be difficult either."</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang took Song Ying and two others to meet the steward of Moon Inquiry City.</p><p>The other person was a young man betrothed to Song Ying. He had a good heart and didn't mind her past.</p><p>Previously, fearing they might anger the cultivator, the two only dared to express their feelings in private. Now, finally able to be together openly, he was willing to return to the mortal world with Song Ying.</p><p>With the steward as their witness, they established a contract. The matter of the Sword Intent Decree was, of course, left unmentioned.</p>
