Launch Day Thoughts


I came home from work this afternoon to find a message from the site admin telling me the book is going live tomorrow. It's so sudden, I'm still in shock.  I only have 1400 collections.

I never expected it to happen this quickly. I remember previous books would go live around 300,000 words.  I thought I wouldn't have a chance until the beginning of next month, at the earliest. I'm still casually working on the outline, completely unprepared.

I've heard that books usually launch at a climactic point in the story to boost initial subscriptions, but I just finished a major conflict, and now the story is in a slow transitional phase. I knew I shouldn't have slacked off on updates the past couple of days.  I could just cry.

There's not much more to say.  I've come this far, so I'll grit my teeth and keep going.

Thank you to the website and my editor for their faith in me.
Thank you to all my readers for your votes, donations, and encouragement.
I truly appreciate it.

Those of you who have been following along know how challenging this book has been to write.  It took over 100,000 words just to get signed, and now it's launching shortly after getting its first promotion. It feels like my path is different from everyone else's.

The inspiration for this book came from Wang Yu and *A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality*. The first major arc was designed as an homage, and the overall style of the book is Xianxia, which I'll continue to maintain. I won't let you down.

I'm just not ready to give up yet!

I know readers have a lot of choices these days, so I don't want to ask for too much. But if you enjoy my writing, please consider subscribing and supporting me.  Let's see if we can boost the subscription ratio and give this book a fighting chance.

Thank you!
I'll guarantee four chapters tomorrow, with the first chapter releasing at noon.  After that, I'll return to my regular schedule.
