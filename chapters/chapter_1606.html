<h1>Chapter 1597: Soul-Guiding Mirror</h1><p>The thousand-zhang giant crocodile crumbled, ultimately transforming into a blazing white light that flew back into the crocodile bone.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, reaching out to grasp the bone.</p><p>The crocodile bone trembled incessantly in his hand, the immense force giving Qin Sang the illusion that he was holding a ferocious beast struggling with all its might.</p><p>Qin Sang extended a wisp of divine sense, probing into the crocodile bone. He sensed an extremely chaotic power, but no independent consciousness existed, leaving him with no point of entry.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. He wondered how the crocodile demon had managed to wield the bone.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then conjured several wisps of Nine Nether Demonic Fire, weaving a net of flames around the crocodile bone. This barely suppressed the bone's power. Gathering the remaining corpse, he escaped into the deep mountains.</p><p>He hadn't flown far</p><p>when a shadow materialized within the forest, trailing behind Qin Sang. The thin shadow moved among the treetops, light as air, cautiously maintaining a distance from Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the shadow was a person, the very mysterious individual who had earlier blocked the crocodile demon's retreat, and also the one who had exposed the puppet crystal and the puppet's identity at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't turn his head, continuing his flight. He asked in a flat tone, "Is Su Zinan looking for me?"</p><p>The center of the shadow undulated slightly, barely revealing a human-like silhouette. "Does Fellow Daoist not know yet? I've heard that Su Zinan is searching for a mysterious person capable of wielding a peculiar spiritual fire. He claims this person killed his elder, resulting in a blood feud, an irreconcilable hatred! I initially dismissed it as nonsense, believing Su Zinan was spouting lies.  Seeing Fellow Daoist today, I now realize that there truly are such unassuming masters in this world…"</p><p>Suddenly, a silver glint flashed within the shadow, followed by a snort. "Fellow Daoist's divine abilities are truly remarkable. However, having just witnessed the crocodile demon's miserable end, I'd advise against using the same methods on me!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He instructed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to withdraw its divine ability, ceasing to spy on the other party.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye divine ability had been blocked by a silver cloak worn by the other person, preventing him from seeing their true face.</p><p>Exposed, Qin Sang showed no shame. He spoke with a hint of sarcasm, "With the Nascent Soul cultivators gone, what does Fellow Daoist fear from Luye?"</p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p>In the snow plains battle, only Yuefei had 'died.'</p><p>If Su Zinan sought revenge for his beloved consort, it would be understandable.  But Old Wu was merely forced to retreat and was still alive and well. What elder of his had been killed?</p><p>There was only one explanation.</p><p>Su Zinan highly valued the Water Phase Lord's legacy and was using this as a pretext to hunt him down.</p><p>"Truly gone?"</p><p>The person within the shadow didn't dwell on the previous unpleasantness.  After a moment of silence, they asked, their tone unreadable.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't answer.</p><p>Various signs within the cultivation world, as well as Yuefei's hints, all suggested that the Nascent Soul cultivators had most likely disappeared.</p><p>But there was still no conclusive evidence. Why had they disappeared, and where had they gone?</p><p>Were they truly trapped within the Illusory Palace? What kind of restriction could trap those Nascent Soul cultivators for centuries, preventing them from finding a way out?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gaze fall upon the demon core in his hand.</p><p>"Nascent Soul Transformation demons entering the Central Plains together is highly unusual. Ask them what they're searching for. If I recall correctly, the demon race also has a Saint King!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Alright!"</p><p>The two flew in silence for a while, distancing themselves from Tianzhong Prefecture. They landed on a desolate, uninhabited mountain.  Qin Sang produced the demon core, using both threats and inducements. Unexpectedly, the crocodile demon proved incredibly stubborn, even nearly finding an opportunity to self-destruct.</p><p>Ultimately, unwilling to waste time, they joined forces to perform a soul search.</p><p>The higher a cultivator's cultivation, the more difficult it becomes to perform a soul search. The same holds true for the demon race.</p><p>Although both Qin Sang and the person within the shadow possessed higher cultivation than the crocodile demon, and Qin Sang's divine sense was exceptional, the soul search was extremely arduous, yielding only fragmented memories.</p><p>The crocodile demon's spirit dissipated.</p><p>Fortunately, they obtained what they sought.</p><p>More than just these three demons had entered the Central Plains. Other powerful demons had dispersed throughout the human cultivation world, even plotting to disrupt the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>The Saint King's Palace was now fractured. These demons were former subordinates of the demon race's Saint King, and their purpose in coming here was to search for their Saint King's whereabouts!</p><p>The demon race's Saint King was also missing!</p><p>Before the Saint King's disappearance, human cultivators had visited the Saint King's Palace. The demon race suspected that their Saint King had been murdered by humans!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Green-furred Rat Demon was the true confidant of the Saint King. The crocodile demon's knowledge was limited, and the person within the shadow slightly regretted not helping Qin Sang capture the rat demon.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang discovered the origin of the crocodile bone.</p><p>The two crocodile demons were originally brothers. During their cultivation, they awakened different bloodline divine abilities of the crocodile demon, causing changes in their appearance, making them vastly different.</p><p>They had discovered the crocodile bone by chance, suspecting it to be the remains of an ancient exotic species. It retained the fierce aura of some ancient ferocious crocodile, similar to their bloodline, allowing them to wield it using their bloodline power.</p><p>Although Qin Sang cultivated the "Celestial Demon Transformation," he lacked the crocodile demon bloodline and naturally couldn't gain the crocodile bone's recognition.</p><p>For a time, both fell silent.</p><p>In this world, very few beings could threaten Nascent Soul cultivators, only a handful of ancient secret realms, and now, the ferocious beasts of the Storm Belt.</p><p>What earth-shattering event had alarmed the Nascent Soul cultivators of both races?</p><p>And they, these great cultivators, second only to the very peak, had sensed nothing.</p><p>All speculation paled in comparison to the shocking, and…terrifying, reality!</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the second crocodile corpse and demon core between them. "Fellow Daoist deserves credit for slaying this demon."</p><p>The person within the shadow understood. They chuckled. "I merely seized the opportunity, delivering an insignificant blow. It was all thanks to Fellow Daoist's great divine abilities. I wouldn't dare claim a share. Consider it a gift to Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "I cannot accept unearned rewards… What is Fellow Daoist's purpose? Speak frankly. I have urgent matters and cannot stay long."</p><p>"At the Treasure Exchange, I made myself clear. I wish to make a trade with Fellow Daoist, in exchange for the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal in your possession," the person within the shadow said seriously.</p><p>After Qin Sang revealed the puppet crystal, they had been the most attentive, pursuing him all the way here.</p><p>"Why must we trade outside?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. The puppet crystal was useless to him. At the Treasure Exchange, there hadn't been much competition for it. As long as the bid was high enough, he would have agreed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, take a look at this treasure first…"</p><p>As they spoke, a gap opened in the center of the shadow, and a silvery-white orb flew out. Within the orb was a net, balled up.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The orb suddenly unfolded, transforming into a shimmering silver net, sometimes solid, sometimes illusory like threads of light, capable of merging with the void.</p><p>Extremely peculiar.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the silver net for a moment, his expression shifting. He let out a soft gasp.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist recognizes it?"</p><p>The person within the shadow said, "This treasure is called the Thousand-Knot Divine Net. It's a rare treasure for spiritual cultivators. When channeling divine sense, upon deploying this treasure and merging it with one's divine sense, it not only solidifies the divine sense, greatly enhancing the power of divine sense techniques, but also provides a certain degree of amplification. Of course, as long as one's divine sense is sufficiently strong, even non-spiritual cultivators can unleash its formidable power."</p><p>Just as the person within the shadow said, purely spiritual cultivation treasures were exceedingly rare.</p><p>It was unclear whether the Jade Buddha counted.</p><p>In his cultivation journey so far, Qin Sang had only encountered a few.</p><p>"Although this treasure cannot increase Fellow Daoist's cultivation level, it is undoubtedly one of the most suitable treasures for spiritual cultivators. Such treasures are truly fortuitous encounters. Exchanging the Thousand-Knot Divine Net for your puppet crystal, Fellow Daoist will certainly not lose out," the person within the shadow said confidently.</p><p>Producing this treasure, they were also extremely reluctant, but the puppet crystal was even more important to them.  With Qin Sang insistent on not accepting other treasures, the person within the shadow had no choice.</p><p>Hearing the effects of the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, Qin Sang's heart stirred!</p><p>He hadn't yet tried the Near Dragon Saliva and didn't know its effects or how long it would take to refine.</p><p>The Thousand-Knot Divine Net could condense and amplify divine sense, providing an immediate effect. The "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" might see immediate improvement. Moreover, in future battles, it could magnify the advantages of his powerful divine sense.</p><p>Qin Sang was already leaning towards the trade. He calmly said, "This treasure's origin is not simple, is it?"</p><p>The Treasure Exchange's spirit array could block secret sound transmission techniques, preventing collusion and chaos.</p><p>This person had taken advantage of the moment Jiang You relaxed the spirit array, allowing everyone to examine the treasures, to transmit a message to him.</p><p>In the presence of so many top experts, they hadn't been exposed.</p><p>The person within the shadow gave a dry laugh. "The Thousand-Knot Divine Net originally belonged to an elder of the瓊影門  … Just now at the Treasure Exchange, the Grand Elder of the Qiong Ying Men was sitting below.  Fellow Daoist understands why I requested to trade outside, yes?"</p><p>"The Grand Elder of the Qiong Ying Men!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled someone. "The female cultivator who purchased the 'Spirit Imprisonment Technique'?"</p><p>"That's her."</p><p>The person within the shadow seemed unwilling to say too much.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, they provoked him, "Surely Fellow Daoist isn't afraid of the Qiong Ying Men and doesn't dare take the Thousand-Knot Divine Net?"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. "This treasure's value lies in its rarity. Its true worth may not equal the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal from an ancient secret realm. However, since Fellow Daoist assisted me in slaying the demon earlier, I won't be too particular. The puppet crystal is yours!"</p><p>Two streams of light flew out from the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>One puppet, one puppet crystal.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang reached out to grasp the Thousand-Knot Divine Net.</p><p>The shadow wriggled, extending a tentacle that snatched the two treasures, then immediately retreated into the darkness like a receding tide, leaving behind a burst of hearty laughter. "Until we meet again!"</p><p>The night was deep.</p><p>The night wind blew gently.</p><p>The forest swayed, as if countless ghostly shadows were hidden within the darkness. The shadow vanished without a trace, as if it had never existed.</p><p>Qin Sang lingered for a moment before also vanishing into the darkness.</p><p>…</p><p>This Treasure Exchange had witnessed a farce that no one had anticipated. Demon cultivators had infiltrated the event and openly ambushed cultivators outside.</p><p>Although the demon cultivators hadn't succeeded and had even lost two powerful demons, suffering a double loss, it still caused the Six Prefectures Hall great shame and fury.</p><p>They had stated beforehand that due to the host's stringent demands, they could only guarantee safety within the Treasure Exchange. All participants were well aware of this.</p><p>If it were humans fighting amongst themselves, the Six Prefectures Hall couldn't be blamed.</p><p>But demon cultivators had been involved, and the Six Prefectures Hall hadn't been able to identify them, nearly becoming a laughingstock. How could they not be enraged?</p><p>Yet they didn't know who to hold accountable.</p><p>After the Green-furred Rat Demon escaped, someone secretly followed, calling upon friends to attempt to hunt down the demon within the Central Plains.  Unexpectedly, the demon's divine abilities were詭秘, vanishing like a puff of smoke, disappearing from the encirclement.</p><p>In the following period, more demon sightings occurred in the Central Plains.</p><p>The demon race was searching everywhere for news of their Saint King. It was unclear how the news spread, but it became widely known.</p><p>…</p><p>Eight Sceneries View.</p><p>As the leading Daoist sect in the Central Prefecture, a True Monarch's Dao Field.</p><p>In people's imagination, Eight Sceneries View should occupy vast mountains and valleys, with endless palaces, countless disciples, and an imposing aura befitting the premier Daoist sect.</p><p>In reality, the true Eight Sceneries View was just an ordinary Daoist temple, located in Jiang Prefecture, one of the six prefectures of Jiangzuo.</p><p>Jiang Prefecture's terrain was seven parts mountains and three parts water.</p><p>But unlike the treacherous mountains and turbulent waters of the two Southern Barbarian Prefectures, here, every mountain was spiritual, and every place was picturesque.</p><p>Eight Sceneries View was nestled deep within the mountains, atop an ordinary peak less than a thousand zhang high. Its scale was similar to a mortal Daoist temple, hidden amidst the forest, a truly serene place.</p><p>In fact, Eight Sceneries View's protective formation only covered the area of this mountain.</p><p>As the premier Daoist sect of the Central Prefecture, Eight Sceneries View had countless disciples. They couldn't all be crammed onto a single mountain. Those who achieved a certain level of cultivation were free to choose a cave dwelling outside to cultivate, living a carefree life.</p><p>Among the mountains, everywhere was an Eight Sceneries View Dao Field!</p><p>Early morning.</p><p>A heavy mist lingered, and dewdrops clung to the blades of grass, reflecting the light of the rising sun in sparkling points of light.</p><p>A figure slowly flew towards Eight Sceneries View.  Nearing the temple, they descended their flying light, landing on the stone steps before Eight Sceneries View as a sign of respect.</p><p>The newcomer was a young Daoist.</p><p>They ran a hand across their face, their features instantly transforming. It was Real Master Hegao!</p><p>The Daoist temple was sparsely populated.</p><p>Apart from the disciples serving the True Monarch and the Temple Master, others rarely came here, so as not to disturb their quiet cultivation.</p><p>The sun was just rising, and purple qi flowed from the east.</p><p>Disciples gathered in twos and threes on the mountaintop, absorbing the purple qi and diligently cultivating.</p><p>There was no one to guide him.</p><p>Real Master Hegao was familiar with the way, entering the Daoist temple alone and arriving at the back, before a simple wooden palace.</p><p>A thin Daoist stood guard before the palace. Seeing Real Master Hegao, they bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Martial Uncle."</p><p>Real Master Hegao opened his mouth, about to speak, when a gentle voice rang out from within the palace. "Junior Brother has returned. Come in."</p><p>The thin Daoist stepped aside, and Real Master Hegao pushed open the door and entered, seeing the current Temple Master of Eight Sceneries View – Real Master Zilei.</p><p>"Senior Brother Temple Master, your injuries have healed?"</p><p>Real Master Hegao asked with concern.</p><p>Real Master Zilei had his back to him, intently focused on something on the table. He nodded slightly.</p><p>Real Master Hegao was overjoyed, and immediately recounted the events at the Treasure Exchange.  "…Senior Brother's discerning eye is truly sharp. That person was indeed suspicious, definitely a remnant of the Formless Immortal Sect!  Openly acquiring Five Elements Restriction-Breaking treasures at the Treasure Exchange, they must be plotting something major…"</p><p>As he spoke, Real Master Hegao noticed the Temple Master's strange behavior and couldn't help but take a step forward.  He saw an ancient, simple, azure mirror placed on the table.</p><p>He was no stranger to this type of mirror.</p><p>It was a Soul-Guiding Mirror, functioning similarly to a Life Soul Lamp, capable of observing the fortune and misfortune of the person whose soul was linked to it.</p><p>Due to the extreme difficulty in refining them, within Eight Sceneries View, only a select few were qualified to possess a Soul-Guiding Mirror. Others could only use ordinary Life Soul Lamps.</p><p>This Soul-Guiding Mirror was covered in cracks, shattered!</p><p>Real Master Hegao was startled, his expression changing drastically. "Which Junior Brother has met with misfortune?"</p><p>Real Master Zilei said quietly, "Martial Uncle Danyu."</p><p>"Martial Uncle…"</p><p>Real Master Hegao's eyes widened in disbelief. He stumbled back two steps. "Impossible! When? During the North Sea demon hunt, Senior Brother, didn't you produce Martial Uncle's decree…"</p><p>"I forged it."</p><p>Real Master Zilei let out an almost imperceptible sigh, with a hint of relief.</p><p>He had been bearing this burden alone, and finally, someone could share it.</p><p>The palace fell silent.</p><p>The sigh was faint, but to Real Master Hegao, it was like a bolt from the blue!</p>
