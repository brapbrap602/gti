<h1>Chapter 162: Encounter</h1><p>After Wu Yuesheng left, Qin Sang returned to the intersection, his face pensive.</p><p>Even though Wu Yuesheng was hidden in the dark, he was certain that Wu Yuesheng's intentions weren't pure. </p><p>Qin Sang recognized Wu Yuesheng as someone dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to team up with someone to cope with the dangerous situations, but he didn't want to collude with a tiger.</p><p>Walking alone with Wu Yuesheng would require him not only to be on alert for danger but also to guard against Wu Yuesheng. The risk just wasn't worth it.</p><p>Due to Qin Sang's eagerness to avoid the fire's detection, he didn't see which path Wu Yuesheng finally took among the remaining four, but he had no intention of fighting Wu Yuesheng to the death.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's strength was superior to his, and he was proficient in escape techniques. Unless Qin Sang launched a sneak attack and killed him in one blow, the situation would quickly reach a stalemate. Furthermore, the dangers of the cave were imminent. This wasn't the time for a life-or-death fight.</p><p>Even if they were to meet later on, Qin Sang was confident that Wu Yuesheng wouldn't know that Qin Sang had discovered his whereabouts, and Qin Sang would be in a better position to deal with him as he would know his enemy while his enemy didn't know him.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang returned to the path he had chosen in the beginning.</p><p>He had some luck because he didn't encounter any evil corpses blocking his way. He passed through several stone paths before he suddenly heard the sound of growls and clashes coming from ahead.</p><p>Someone was fighting an evil corpse?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He concealed his aura and stealthily approached. Soon, he saw two struggling figures in a stone chamber. As he had expected, one of them was an evil corpse, and the other was Liu Jiang, the older brother of the Liu duo.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed forward, glanced around, but didn't see Liu Shan. It seemed that the two brothers had also been separated.</p><p>The evil corpse's strength was similar to that of the one Qin Sang had previously killed. Its physical defense was quite strong. Foundation Establishment cultivators would find it troublesome but would still be able to kill it if they put in the time.</p><p>However, Liu Jiang was only at the thirteenth layer of the Qi Refining stage. Without Liu Shan's assistance, his strength was comparable to any ordinary cultivator at the thirteenth layer of the Qi Refining stage. It was a bit difficult for him to deal with the evil corpse.</p><p>Liu Jiang's magic weapon was half an iron lotus. The lotus petals were fully spread out like a dozen sharp flying knives tied together. They were continuously circling the evil corpse, attacking and sending out beams of knife shadows.</p><p>The iron lotus was quite powerful. Each knife shadow could leave a deep wound on the evil corpse, but Liu Jiang couldn't suppress the evil corpse and couldn't attack the same spot continuously. These wounds would quickly be healed by the evil earth energy, and his efforts achieved very little.</p><p>Liu Jiang could only exhaust the evil earth energy of the evil corpse before he could possibly kill it.</p><p>Qin Sang could see that Liu Jiang wanted to escape, but his path was blocked by the evil corpse. Furthermore, the evil corpse was as fast as Liu Jiang and was extremely agile. Its ghostly claws carried a corpse poison, and each swing carried a bone-chilling evil earth energy.</p><p>Liu Jiang dared not test his limits and could only dodge desperately in the narrow stone chamber. Instead, he was dominated by the evil corpse, and his heart was increasingly full of anxiety.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the situation and quietly returned to his previous position. Then, he revealed himself and soared over. He swept the stone chamber with his eyes and asked in a deep voice, "Which Fellow Daoist Liu is this?"</p><p>Liu Jiang was overjoyed when he saw Qin Sang and exclaimed, "I am Liu Jiang. I have met Senior Qin. I was entangled by this evil corpse and couldn't come to greet you. Please forgive me, Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly at him, looked at the evil corpse, and said, "I will help Fellow Daoist Liu kill this beast first."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang summoned the Five Elements Breaking Law Sword. The sword transformed into a swimming dragon, and soon suppressed the evil corpse.</p><p>Liu Jiang secretly sighed in relief and immediately followed Qin Sang's instructions. He urged the iron lotus to fly behind the evil corpse and shot out beams of knives, striking the evil corpse's neck.</p><p>The wound on the evil corpse's neck grew larger and larger. The evil earth energy was unable to heal it in time. In the end, the evil corpse was beheaded by Liu Jiang. Just like the evil corpse Qin Sang had encountered before, it turned into a thin cultivator after the evil earth energy dissipated and then into a pile of ashes.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought that the evil corpses in the cave were probably made from the bodies of cultivators. He had only walked this section of the path and had already encountered dozens of evil corpses. There were not so many cultivator corpses from normal sources. This demonic sect must have harmed many people.</p><p>"Thank you for your help, Senior Qin."</p><p>Liu Jiang's breathing eased slightly, and he bowed to Qin Sang with respect.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense Liu Jiang's restraint, but he didn't find it strange. If he was in the same situation, he would also be worried about whether the other person had ulterior motives.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu, were you and Liu Shan also separated?"</p><p>Liu Jiang smiled wryly and said, "The suction came too suddenly. Before we could react, we were sucked into the cave and almost got separated at that time.</p><p>After the Exploding Fire Crow Formation's self-detonation, my brother and I were affected by the impact and could no longer maintain our cultivation methods. Luckily, I was knocked away by the force and fell into a cave. Liu Shan kept falling downwards. The last I saw was that he seemed to have been pulled up by Senior Qing Ting. And because our cultivation methods are the same and we've had mind induction since we were young, I could feel that Liu Shan is still alive. I was going to meet up with them, but I didn't expect to encounter such a tricky evil corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the opportunity quite early and escaped into the cave first, so he didn't see the scene of Qing Ting saving Liu Shan.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had an impression of where everyone was when the Exploding Fire Crow Formation exploded. If Liu Shan had kept falling, he would indeed have been closest to Qing Ting.</p><p>"Can Fellow Cultivator Liu confirm Liu Shan's location?" Qin Sang further asked.</p><p>Liu Jiang nodded and said, "I can sense Liu Shan to our lower left, but it's very faint and there's quite a distance in between. He should also be able to sense my location, but unfortunately, the direction of the stone path keeps changing and we just can't meet up. It might take us a long time to bump into each other."</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an "mmhm" and said. "Fellow Cultivator Liu should have also noticed that as we walk deeper, these tunnels will gather towards one place. We will definitely bump into each other. If that's the case, then I will ask Fellow Cultivator Liu to take the lead, as we try to keep going down. This is the Devil Sect's lair, so there should be many refined corpses. For now, you and I can still barely handle the situation, but we might encounter even stronger evil corpses later on. We should meet up with the other fellow cultivators as soon as possible to join forces and confront the danger."</p><p>Although Liu Jiang is not as strong as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he's still a good helper and it would be much easier to deal with the evil corpses. Even if he didn't have the mind induction ability, Qin Sang would have brought him along.</p><p>After the fight just now, Liu Jiang also knew that he wouldn't be able to get far on his own. He would lose his life if he encountered an evil corpse that was even slightly stronger.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had saved him, so when Qin Sang made the suggestion, Liu Jiang had no reason to disagree and promptly accepted.</p><p>A loud rumbling sound came from the stone path behind them. The Earthly Fiend Qi was still surging violently. They didn't dare to delay for too long. They waited for Liu Jiang to adjust his breathing for a bit before they set off in a hurry.</p><p>With the two of them working together, it was much easier to deal with the evil corpses. They encountered two evil corpses one after another. One of the evil corpses was very strong, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would have found it tricky, but they managed to kill it with no major problems.</p>
