"Boom!"
The water screen glowed in blue and a row of huge waves surged out, water splattered all about and the gigantic waves surged with berserk water source energy, with irresistible momentum, ruthlessly smashing into the invaders.
Today marked the third day of entering the illusion array space.
The restrictions on the heavy iron gate at the branch hall of the Heavenly Corpse Sect were stronger than the water screen, but they had become easier to crack because they had been around for a long time and their potency had leaked out; the water screen restriction was not that simple.
As early as the first day, the Divine Fire Cover had almost been destroyed by the countershock from the restriction, Qin Sang had no choice but to put it away.
In front of the gigantic waves, Qin Sang the three of them looked so diminutive, it felt like they would be smashed into pulp in the next moment.
Qin Sang, sitting cross-legged on the ground, suddenly reached out and summoned the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword into his palm, then activated the Sky Star Tear, expanding the light shield with all his might, also protecting the Yue sisters behind him.
At the same time, light flashed in the middle of Qin Sang's eyebrows, the Ebonywood Sword released sword energy that was several dozen zhang long, ruthlessly slashing at the gigantic wave.
"Whoosh!"
Although the sword energy did not split the gigantic wave open completely, the place where it was struck was also greatly reduced, and could be resisted entirely by the Sky Star Tear.
Hiding behind Qin Sang, the Yue sisters huddled tightly together, although it was not their first time seeing such a spectacle, their faces could not help but show a look of horror.
Seeing Qin Sang's process of breaking the restriction, they discovered that the restriction of the Mysterious Azure True Person's cave dwelling was even more powerful than they had imagined, even if they had broken through to Establish Foundation, they were not confident that they would be able to break the restriction, and so were even more fortunate that they had asked Qin Sang to help them.
According to their observations, although Qin Sang had failed countless times, there was something new every time, and now he even wore the appearance of having a plan.
In fact, their guess was correct, three days of uninterrupted trials – Qin Sang already understood this restriction very well, if he wanted to break the restriction, he had a good chance at succeeding, but he wanted to take advantage of this rare opportunity to use the restriction to comprehend his Senior Sister Qing Ting's perception, which was why he had still not gone all out.
Another day passed and the Yue sisters became anxious with waiting time, yet Qin Sang still wore a leisurely expression, after extinguishing the recoil of the restriction yet again, a gleam of radiance flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, this restriction was not much help to him anymore, he could start to break the restriction.
Qin Sang took out the Divine Fire Cover again and tossed it to the Yue sisters, reminding them, "I will go all out to break the restriction now, I may not be able to account for everything, the two of you work together to activate the Divine Fire Cover to protect yourselves."
Done speaking, Qin Sang reached out and pointed, the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword suddenly separated, each of them pointing towards one spot on the water screen restriction from afar, these few places were all at the weakest points of the water screen restriction, Qin Sang had already tested it out thoroughly.
This place was right on a spiritual vein, so naturally the spiritual energy was extremely rich, the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword activated the spiritual energy, transforming into five azure dragons, their power increased somewhat.
The Yue sisters worked together to activate the Divine Fire Cover, their expressions a mixture of expectation and worry.
They saw the power of the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword being activated to the extreme, suddenly disappearing on the same spot, when it reappeared, it was already in front of the water screen restriction, and moreover the points of the swords stabbed deep into the water screen!
"Woo-hoo..."
The spiritual energy in space suddenly became chaotic, the azure dragons acted as a guide, five elements spiritual energy surged towards the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword madly, the spiritual sword shook lightly, emitting a melodious sword hum, the body of the spiritual sword disappeared from the line of sight, turning into five dazzling spots of light.
"Break for me!"
Along with a heavy shout from Qin Sang, the entire space suddenly became dim.
The five spots of light suddenly exploded, the force of the explosion was entirely absorbed by the water screen restriction, and huge cracks suddenly appeared on the water screen, but it was still a cornered beast putting up a fight, terrifying ice blades, ice swords, gigantic waves, and mad waves surged out together.
The Yue sisters' faces turned white, they could only activate the Divine Fire Cover helplessly, they could only hope that Qin Sang would be able to break the restriction quickly.
Qin Sang was already prepared, and did not wait until the recoil from the restriction was upon him, looking for a point where the cracks intersected, he silently activated the Ebonywood Sword, only to see a sword light flash by, the Ebonywood Sword easily pierced through the water screen.
A huge hole appeared in the water screen where it had been pierced by the Ebonywood Sword, and then it rapidly fractured along the cracks, using the huge hole as the centre, and the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword was not far behind either.
A crisp sound, and the water screen shattered entirely like glass, Qin Sang immediately picked up the Yue sisters, their figures quickly shuttling through ice shards that filled the sky and covered the earth, and finally landed in front of the stone gate unharmed, putting both magical implements away.

'Kaboom…'

The aftershocks from the enchantment's counterattack were still raging at the edge of the dimension. The Le sisters handed the Spirit Fire Shield back to Qin Sang with apprehension. Their attitude became more reverent. "Thank you, senior, for taking the time to help us sisters."

Qin Sang did not pay any attention to the aftershocks. He turned and looked at the tightly shut stone door and said, "There might be some enchantments or traps in the cave. You two should be careful."

They had become completely convinced by Qin Sang. They spoke at the same time, "We will follow everything senior says."

Qin Sang nodded and stayed rooted. He used his spiritual energy to form a hand that pushed open the stone door. Surprisingly, it opened slowly without much resistance. There was a rough passage behind the door that seemed harmless.

The three of them walked in cautiously. Apart from the water barrier outside, they did not find any more enchantments. At the end of the passage was a stone chamber the size of two rooms. It was very simply furnished, almost as simple as Qin Sang’s cave.

This was Immortal Cang Li's cave. Even though there was no spiritual spring, the spiritual energy was still very rich. Even a Foundation Establishment Period cultivator would be satisfied with a place like this.

"Yes! We finally have our own cave!" Yue Rou hugged her sister Yue Xing and cried out of joy.

Qin Sang was not in the mood to appreciate the scene. He stood there motionless, his eyes fixed on the stone bed at the back of the cave. His eyes were full of surprise and astonishment.

Yue Xing was calmer than her sister, after comforting the agitated Yue Rou, she noticed something strange about Qin Sang. She followed his gaze but did not see anything special about the stone bed. She asked, "Senior Qin, what are you looking at?"

Before she could finish, Yue Rou suddenly screamed out loud, her body collapsed onto the ground.

Yue Xing's face changed, she hurriedly hugged Yue Rou, only to see that her face was filled with pain, her breathing was erratic, and her eyes were rolling around without focus, with intense fear in her eyes. Her body was trembling as if she had seen something terrifying.

Qin Sang was awakened by Yue Rou's scream. He came back to his senses and saw this scene. He immediately flashed over, tapped Yue Rou's Baihui point, knocking her out, and then took out a spiritual pill and made her swallow it.

Yue Xing was very anxious, she kept asking, "Senior Qin, what has happened? What is in this cave? Why has my sister suddenly become like this?"

"Don't use your spiritual perception to touch the sword mark on the stone bed!" Qin Sang said solemnly.

"Sword mark?"

Yue Xing was stunned. She turned and looked at the crack in the middle of the stone bed. She thought it was a crack in the stone bed, but it was actually a sword mark?
