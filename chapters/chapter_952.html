<h1>Chapter 944: Chaos</h1><p>The grand formation shattered the demonic barrier and delivered the lost souls, creating a heaven-shaking commotion, yet the sound didn't travel far.</p><p>After the upheaval, the clouds above the forbidden zone shimmered briefly, effortlessly dissipating the unusual phenomena. The disturbance didn't even reach the outer edges of the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>The Great Rift Valley was affected, but there were no landslides or ground fissures. Only the ferocious beasts dwelling in the valley's depths were startled.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai faintly heard chanting.</p><p>Bai seemed relieved of a heavy burden.</p><p>He stared blankly at the sky, having finally fulfilled his oath, but his eyes held a hint of confusion and melancholy.</p><p>"My obsession is gone. I will journey far to find myself. I will pay my respects to everyone again in the future," Bai thought silently.</p><p>The residual energy surged, and the two were like lone boats in a storm.</p><p>Bai gathered the ghost mist with all his might, carrying them towards the canyon.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Twin-Headed Serpent to coil around him, activating his Phoenix Wings, and prepared to awaken his External Avatar at any moment. If anything went wrong, he could only sacrifice his pawn to save his king, using the avatar to distract the Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>They were already hiding near the canyon entrance and reached it in an instant, faintly hearing enraged roars.</p><p>The demonic barrier, the Deliverance Formation, and the ghost mist intertwined, creating a scene of chaos outside the canyon.</p><p>Using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's power, Qin Sang saw the demonic barrier reappear on the cliff walls, beginning to crumble. Stone fragments fell from the cliffs, but the mountain only trembled, not collapsing.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire had been dispersed, and the Nascent Soul cultivator was being bombarded.</p><p>Outside the canyon, a ghastly white light flickered, and within it, countless square bone tile phantoms appeared. These bone tiles seemed to seal evil spirits, emitting chilling screams.</p><p>"So it's bone tiles!" Qin Sang's heart stirred, recalling the scene he had glimpsed earlier.</p><p>"Let's go!" Bai urged through voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. This was the moment when the residual energy was at its peak.</p><p>Shielded by the bone tile formation, the Nascent Soul cultivator appeared unharmed. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy was too chaotic, and his Heavenly Eye was limited, preventing him from seeing the true state of the bone tile formation.</p><p>The demonic barrier's collapse started from the center of the Ghost Land. Because the restrictions at the canyon entrance were the weakest and were deliberately targeted by Bai, it crumbled so quickly. Once the demonic barriers around the Ghost Land completely collapsed, the ghost mist would also dissipate.</p><p>By then, the Nascent Soul cultivator would regain his footing and have the energy to search for them. It would be too late to leave.</p><p>Therefore, they had to seize this opportunity to escape while the Nascent Soul cultivator was preoccupied.</p><p>They exchanged glances and plunged into the canyon. One used divine abilities, the other activated magical treasures, cooperating closely. They drifted along with the ghost mist and were swept out of the canyon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>They didn't dare to breathe, their hearts pounding as they swept past the bone tile formation.</p><p>At this moment, Mou Laomo was fully activating the formation, his face grim.</p><p>He hadn't expected such a change in the Ghost Land. A terrifying wave suddenly appeared, instantly scattering the demonic fire he had been coveting.</p><p>Caught off guard, Mou Laomo was struck like by a heavy blow, sent flying backward. Fortunately, the demonic fire had weakened, and the bone tile formation he had set up earlier helped him withstand the impact. Otherwise, the outcome would have been dire.</p><p>Watching the demonic fire dissipate, Mou Laomo's heart bled.</p><p>Unlike others, he didn't care about the treasures in the Ghost Land. The demonic fire was his goal.</p><p>If he could subdue this demonic fire, he not only had great hope of advancing to the late Nascent Soul stage, becoming a top expert in the Canglang Sea, but even a sliver of a chance of reaching Deity Transformation.</p><p>His beautiful fantasy shattered before his eyes, and Mou Laomo was furious.</p><p>Now, cracks appeared on some of the bone tiles, but he didn't have the slightest intention of retreating. He spared no effort in activating the formation, resisting the impact, and going upstream to block the canyon.</p><p>Even at the most dangerous moment, Mou Laomo didn't forget to use a sliver of his divine sense to investigate, lest he overlooked anything. If not for the ancient treasure, the Red Cloud Shawl, and Bai's ghost mist manipulation technique, he might have actually detected something.</p><p>Without the demonic fire, only obtaining the treasures inside could compensate for his loss.</p><p>Before that mysterious person appeared, no one had ever set foot in the Ghost Land.</p><p>Mou Laomo didn't know what restrictions the mysterious person had triggered in the Ghost Land to cause such a commotion, but he assumed that this person was also suffering and couldn't escape.</p><p>If the mysterious person died on the spot, he would have picked up a bargain.</p><p>If he was seriously injured and fled, it would be even better. Intercepting this person would not only yield the Ghost Land treasures but also allow for soul searching, revealing how this person resisted the demonic fire and infiltrated the Ghost Land.</p><p>Perhaps he could even find the demonic fire later.</p><p>Just then, Mou Laomo noticed that the fluctuations were weakening. Overjoyed, he spared no effort in driving the formation into the canyon, unaware that the culprits had already escaped while he was being bombarded.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai successfully escaped. Seeing that they hadn't been detected, they were relieved, but they didn't dare to relax. After awakening the Fat Silkworm, they fled outwards with all their might.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before reaching the rift valley walls, they heard roars echoing from the depths of the rift, like tigers and dragons roaring, getting closer and closer.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He quickly asked, "Are there Nascent Soul level beasts here?"</p><p>Bai nodded. "Over the years, there have been a few that prowled before the demonic fire, with auras equivalent to Nascent Soul. As for how many, I'm not sure."</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. "We must leave as soon as possible. I believe my escape technique is better than yours. The Heavenly Corpse Talisman and Soul Mark in your body haven't been broken. Perhaps you can still enter the Corpse Puppet Bag. I wonder if you're willing to endure this indignity?"</p><p>Top-tier beasts had been startled. If they encountered the Nascent Soul cultivator, a great battle might ensue.</p><p>But Qin Sang had no intention of reaping the benefits. He had gained enough and there was no need to risk it. Moreover, the Nascent Soul cultivator's cultivation was exceptionally high, and the beasts might not be able to stop him.</p><p>Bai had first unsealed the altar and then manipulated the ghost mist to deceive the Nascent Soul cultivator, greatly depleting his energy. He didn't have much strength left, and his escape technique was far inferior to Qin Sang's.</p><p>The Heart Devil Oath they had made required them to help each other until they were out of danger. Qin Sang naturally wouldn't break his promise, but he couldn't be dragged down by Bai, so he had him try to enter the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Once they were safe, he still had many questions to ask Bai.</p><p>"I've witnessed your escape technique... In the face of such danger, what's a little indignity?"</p><p>Bai didn't mind. Seeing Qin Sang open the Corpse Puppet Bag, he relaxed some of the restrictions on the refined corpse's soul.</p><p>Perhaps because Bai was originally a remnant soul, as soon as Qin Sang made a hand seal, he actually managed to put him into the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>"It's quiet here. I'll just adjust my breath and recover. I'll trouble you, fellow Daoist."</p><p>Hearing Bai's voice transmission, Qin Sang looked at the Corpse Puppet Bag with surprise, then spread his Phoenix Wings, surrounded himself with the Jiao Soul, and summoned the Ebony Sword, using the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique.</p><p>Using three top-tier escape techniques simultaneously, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of cyan, red, and white light, fleeing in panic, not even daring to retrieve the amethyst.</p><p>The aura of a top-tier beast was approaching from that direction.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm grunted in dissatisfaction. Qin Sang had broken his promise.</p>
