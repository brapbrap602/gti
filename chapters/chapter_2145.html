<h1>Chapter 2135: News from Purple Cloud Mountain</h1><p>Si Lu and the others continuously employed great magical power, cleansing the battlefield and reorganizing the remnants of Lu Wang's army.</p><p>The direct descendants of the Lu family were all singled out, left in the Storm Realm, and integrated with the demon soldiers. Those Lu family vassals and clans with different surnames were still usable. Si Lu promised to let them join the Si family of Weir Mountain, a status slightly lower than their position in the Lu family, but far better than extermination. This quickly rallied the remaining troops.</p><p>Compared to the imposing manner of Lu Wang's army when it launched the attack, now, they were a defeated army, though still possessing some strength.</p><p>Shi Mu and the other experts, previously driven by profit, were now reduced to prisoners, controlled by others, and dared not refuse to contribute.</p><p>At a glance, they were a considerable force.  When Si Lu returned with a great victory, the remnants of Weir Wang would surely come to pledge their allegiance, and the strength of the Si family of Weir Mountain would continue to grow. Except for the lack of a top expert at the helm, their strength would likely be comparable to their peak.</p><p>The role of this top expert could only be filled by Qin Sang.</p><p>The feat of killing the Grand Offering and Lu Wang could deter some, but he was, after all, an outsider. He could only act in the name of a Guest Elder, and his actions needed to be carefully considered. Some rules couldn't be broken. Being too arrogant wouldn't be beneficial to Si Lu. If it provoked public resentment, and the Imperial Lord seized the opportunity to attack, it would lead to another bloody conflict, one where the Thunder Altar's influence wouldn't reach.</p><p>Si Lu harbored no ambition to replace the Imperial Lord, and Qin Sang wouldn't support it either.</p><p>"Brother Qin, we shall take our leave first!"</p><p>Si Lu reorganized the army, took over the Lu family's flying ships, ordered all soldiers to board, and prepared for departure.</p><p>Su Nu and Zhu Que, leading a group of Storm Realm experts, accompanied him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, just about to speak when his expression shifted slightly as he looked towards a barren hill in the distance.</p><p>Above the barren hill, the wind stirred and clouds surged, with myriad rays of radiant light.</p><p>This was a celestial phenomenon caused by the turbulent movement of Heaven and Earth's vital energy, a clear sign of a breakthrough in cultivation, which attracted everyone's attention.</p><p>"So it's Huan Hen…"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>On the barren hill, Huan Hen sat cross-legged on a rock, his spirit sword placed flat on his knees, his eyes closed tightly.</p><p>The one breaking through was indeed Huan Hen, with Jian Nu protecting him from afar.</p><p>The two didn't have the formal title of master and disciple, but they had the true essence of the relationship.  In the previous great battle, they didn't preside over the spell formation from the rear, but instead entered the battlefield themselves to hone their swordsmanship.</p><p>Their experience on the battlefield was completely different from Qin Sang's. There were countless previously unseen magical treasures and experts comparable to the Void Refinement stage appearing one after another. Enemies with strength equal to or even greater than theirs were everywhere.</p><p>Although protected by thunder talismans, they couldn't be watched over every moment and often faced life-threatening danger. This kind of tempering was precisely what they sought. Having experienced the trials of battle, Huan Hen's swordsmanship had greatly advanced, successfully completing this sword-honing journey!</p><p>There were quite a few Nascent Soul cultivators present, so Huan Hen's breakthrough didn't cause much of a stir.</p><p>Transforming intent into a sword, severing all obstacles, stepping into the Nascent Soul realm!</p><p>Huan Hen soared into the sky on his sword, sword light like a dragon, full of spirit and vigor.</p><p>At this time, some cultivators present revealed solemn expressions, realizing that although Huan Hen's cultivation level wasn't extremely high, his strength couldn't be judged by conventional standards.</p><p>"Greetings, Martial Uncle Qin! Disciple is overjoyed, please punish me!"</p><p>Huan Hen noticed Qin Sang's gaze and quickly withdrew his sword light, flying to Qin Sang and kneeling in mid-air.</p><p>According to the lineage left by Qing Zhu, Shangguan Lifeng ranked after Qin Sang, hence Huan Hen addressed him as Martial Uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't punish him for this small matter, and smiled, "Your ability to achieve today's accomplishment shows your talent and temperament are both exceptional.  It hasn't been in vain that your Master and Fellow Daoist Jian Nu cultivated you painstakingly. You may return to the sect first. After consolidating your gains, come to my cave dwelling."</p><p>"Disciple obeys!"</p><p>Huan Hen was secretly excited; this meant Qin Sang would personally guide him.</p><p>At this time, Jian Nu also flew forward, cupping his hands and saying, "After this battle, this old servant has also gained some insights, but it is inconvenient for me to go to Hanjiang Lu Manor with everyone."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is also about to break through?"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. Once Jian Nu stepped into the Void Refinement stage, he would have another powerful general by his side.</p><p>"I can touch upon the threshold of the next realm, but whether I can break through is still unknown," Jian Nu said humbly.</p><p>...</p><p>Jian Nu and Huan Hen returned to Green Ram Temple. Si Lu, Su Nu, and the others also bid farewell to him. Flying ships, covering the sky and blotting out the sun, soared through the air.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the open sea, took a step in mid-air, and vanished.</p><p>...</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared above the sea, looking up at the sky. Suddenly, a beam of azure light descended from the heavens and entered his crown.</p><p>When the azure light dissipated, Qin Sang held Min Zhuo in one hand and played with the Thousand Jun Ring in the other. After pondering for a moment, he vanished again.</p><p>...</p><p>Green Ram Temple.</p><p>The illusory image of the Thunder Altar dispersed, and Green Ram Temple returned to its original scenery. The main body of the spell formation sat quietly in the valley, peaceful and serene. Ordinary people could hardly imagine that the Fourth-Order Thunder Talisman, the Thunder Oath Chapter, which had defeated Lu Wang's army and slain top experts, had been launched from this very formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared within the valley. He swept his gaze across the area and consecutively executed several hand seals.</p><p>The grand formation in the valley transformed accordingly. With a shift of light and shadow, the formation expanded outwards. The surrounding mountain peaks were moved by Qin Sang, opening up a vast expanse of empty land.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Mount Daiyu appeared, descending towards the ground, causing the earth to tremble violently.</p><p>White mist drifted, instantly enveloping the valley in a hazy shroud.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed onto the stone platform, sat cross-legged in front of the stone tablet, calmed his mind, and sensed the tablet.</p><p>His Dharma Body, possessing a higher cultivation level than his Dharma Idol, had, as expected, yielded new insights. However, it was still insufficient for him to refine the immortal mountain or to peer into its true profound mysteries.</p><p>Since the immortal mountain had been brought back, there was no need to rush. Qin Sang activated more ancient restrictions, sealing the mountain, preventing its fluctuations from leaking out, saving it for future exploration.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out towards the crack in the immortal mountain and made a grasping motion. Azure light flickered, and a mass of Azure Spirit Qi floated out, flying towards Qin Sang and slowly rotating.</p><p>All the Azure Spirit Qi within the crack had been extracted by him.  Combined with what had been collected previously, all the Azure Spirit Qi was now gathered here.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's findings over this period, the Azure Spirit Qi was most likely born during ascension and was also related to the environment at the time. Before he understood the secrets of the entire immortal mountain, there likely wouldn't be any new Azure Spirit Qi.  Each use meant one less.</p><p>For the cultivators of the entire Storm Realm, this Azure Spirit Qi was still far too little. Now that the war had subsided, the previous method of distribution needed to be changed.  Qin Sang planned to establish some rules, using the Azure Spirit Qi as a reward and encouragement.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang believed that relying on Azure Spirit Qi for every breakthrough wasn't necessarily a good thing. The Storm Realm cultivators who had been elevated in this way, more or less, all exhibited signs of an unstable foundation. However, due to the external threats, they had been forced to prioritize immediate results.</p><p>Mist shrouded the immortal mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang left the valley, released some of the restrictions on Min Zhuo, and woke him.</p><p>With his life in Qin Sang's hands, Min Zhuo knew he had no qualifications to negotiate. Concealment and delay would only result in unnecessary suffering. He answered all of Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>Qin Sang was most interested in the origins of the immortal mountain and the various classics treasured by the Chang You clan. Regarding Min Zhuo's actions before the war, Qin Sang initially asked casually. However, as he listened to Min Zhuo's answers, his expression grew increasingly grim.</p><p>Min Zhuo's breakthrough wasn't achieved through his own abilities. Informing Lu Wang wasn't due to his resourcefulness or having seen through Si Lu's background.</p><p>Everything, everything, was arranged by someone else, another person pulling the strings from behind the scenes!</p><p>"You don't know that person's identity?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was icy as he stared into Min Zhuo's eyes.</p><p>Min Zhuo met his gaze calmly and sighed, "This old man was merely a pawn in that person's hand. I thought I could jump off the chessboard, but it was all an illusion."</p><p>"Besides Zai Zhen, how many other experts followed that person's orders and came to assist?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"Their identities aren't difficult to guess. However, this old man believes they were all invited by Zai Zhen and likely unaware of the inside story..."</p><p>Min Zhuo spoke frankly, revealing everything.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized these individuals' identities.  Being an outsider, it wasn't convenient for him to personally investigate. He could only inform Yuan Miao and Clan Leader Yuan Xiang first.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Min Zhuo, as if seeking death, sneered, "Could it be that True Person Qin has offended too many people and can't recall who is targeting you in secret? Those with the courage and ability to do this are at least at the level of Zhu Yan Clan elders, or a powerful force capable of rivaling the Zhu Yan Clan. Perhaps, in the near future, this old man will witness you following in our clan's footsteps, haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't lower himself to argue with a prisoner. However, Min Zhuo's words touched upon his concerns.</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang and Yuan Miao's attitudes towards the Storm Realm didn't seem feigned.  So who was the person behind the scenes? Was it internal strife within the Zhu Yan Clan, or was there a mysterious enemy, lurking in the shadows, constantly observing?</p><p>Min Zhuo couldn't provide him with answers to these questions.</p><p>After imprisoning Min Zhuo once again, Qin Sang sat in his quiet chamber, recalling his past experiences, attempting to find clues.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something, raising his head to look beyond the mountain.</p><p>"They should be here."</p><p>He murmured, his figure flashing as he appeared outside Green Ram Temple, where he saw Clan Leader Yuan Xiang and bowed in greeting.</p><p>After the battle, Yuan Miao had taken his leave, saying he was returning to report to the Clan Leader. Qin Sang suspected that Yuan Xiang had been near the battlefield all along.</p><p>Yuan Xiang, his face flushed, the smell of alcohol still lingering on him, sat on a rock atop the mountain, holding a wine gourd, and shouted with delight, "True Person Qin's battle was exhilarating and awe-inspiring! We must celebrate with a drink!"</p><p>"Clan Leader Yuan Xiang flatters me. I must also thank Clan Leader Yuan Xiang for delaying Lu Wang's army and setting a deadline, urging them to seek quick victories. This allowed me to remain composed, find the right opportunity, and achieve victory. Otherwise, the outcome would have been uncertain!" Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>"Mere details, not worth mentioning! That Grand Offering held himself in high regard and underestimated you, True Person. He deserved his downfall."</p><p>Yuan Xiang waved his hand dismissively, then changed his tone, smiling slyly, "Yuan Miao said that Clan Leader Min Zhuo has already perished at your hand, True Person. After this battle, the Chang You clan is severely weakened and no longer poses a threat to you. I wonder how you intend to deal with them, True Person?"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and said, "I leave it to Clan Leader Yuan Xiang's discretion!"</p><p>Yuan Xiang nodded with satisfaction, "It's nothing more than ceding territory and paying reparations."</p><p>As they spoke, the sound of something breaking through the air came from afar. Yuan Miao arrived on a cloud, accompanied by two others. One of them was Min Zhuo's son, Min Shu, the new Clan Leader of the Chang You Clan.</p><p>Min Shu, still shaken, couldn't help but tremble when he saw Qin Sang.</p><p>He dared not harbor any resentment towards Qin Sang, only endless fear.</p><p>"The sacred grounds of the Chang You clan are left by our ancestors. Although this old man wants the entire Chang You clan to relocate, to separate you and allow time to heal the hatred, unfortunately, the ancestral teachings cannot be changed. I hope True Person Qin can leave Holy沐 Plain to the Chang You clan..." Clan Leader Yuan Xiang said slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that this was the Zhu Yan clan's bottom line. He immediately made his stance clear that he wouldn't set foot on Holy沐 Plain.</p><p>The three domains and the vast surrounding sea, with countless islands and reefs, were enough to accommodate the cultivators of the Storm Realm. When choosing this place as his cultivation ground, Qin Sang had been mentally prepared. His territory couldn't continue to expand in the Mist Sea. If he continued to progress on the Great Vehicle Path, he would inevitably have to choose a new cultivation ground elsewhere.</p><p>With Clan Leader Min Zhuo captured, more than half of their experts fallen in battle, and the remaining experts like the Tenth Elder captured alive by Qin Sang, the Chang You clan could be said to have been knocked back to their state a thousand years ago.</p><p>Without Azure Spirit Qi, it would be incredibly difficult for the Chang You clan to regain their former glory.</p><p>The Chang You clan was no longer qualified to be the Storm Realm's adversary. Keeping them as an enemy could serve as a whetstone for future generations.</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice, summoning Li Yufu, and asked him to discuss matters with Min Shu. His only requirement was to have all the classics treasured by the Chang You clan brought over.</p><p>Li Yufu invited Yuan Miao, Min Shu, and the others into the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression then turned serious. He said solemnly, "This humble Daoist learned some secrets from Min Zhuo and is about to report them to Clan Leader Yuan Xiang."</p><p>Seeing his serious demeanor, Yuan Xiang wiped the casual expression from his face. "Please speak, True Person."</p><p>Qin Sang then relayed the information he had obtained from Min Zhuo to Yuan Xiang in detail.</p><p>Yuan Xiang's expression gradually grew grave, and after hearing everything, he remained silent for a long time.</p><p>Releasing Min Zhuo might lure out the person behind the scenes, but after some thought, Qin Sang didn't reveal that Min Zhuo was still alive.</p><p>If Mount Daiyu truly had such a significant background, it was naturally best to conceal it as much as possible.</p><p>Within the Chang You clan, some classics could only be accessed by the Clan Leader. Fearing leaks, Min Zhuo had never disclosed their contents to anyone.  Aside from Min Zhuo, even if others had heard about Mount Daiyu from the Storm Realm cultivators, they wouldn't have imagined the greater secret behind it. Even Min Shu only knew that Min Zhuo had infiltrated the Tainted Lands to search for the source of Azure Spirit Qi and was unaware of the deeper truth.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>After a long silence, Clan Leader Yuan Xiang sighed and shook his head. "This time, True Person, you may have been inadvertently involved. Since this game has been lost, and you have demonstrated such strength, that person will not target you again. You can rest assured, True Person."</p><p>Yuan Xiang only hinted at the truth.</p><p>Seeing that he clearly knew something but was unwilling to reveal it, Qin Sang didn't press further but could guess a thing or two, nodding silently.</p><p>Clan Leader Yuan Xiang's judgment should be trustworthy. Moreover, with the Thunder Altar, unless a Body Integration stage cultivator personally came, Qin Sang wouldn't be afraid of them.</p><p>"Oh! There is one more thing, I almost forgot..."</p><p>Yuan Xiang reached into his sleeve, retrieved a circular jade token, and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"While you were battling Lu Wang, True Person, someone came from Purple Cloud Mountain. Seeing that you were capable of handling the situation, they didn't reveal themselves but left this item, saying that whenever you have free time, go to the location indicated by the jade token, and someone will meet you."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He took the jade token and asked, "Was the visitor Liu Li?"</p><p>"It was not Fairy Liu Li."</p><p>Yuan Xiang shook his head. "It's not convenient for this old man to reveal too much. True Person, by personally going to Purple Cloud Mountain, you will be able to unravel all your doubts."</p><p>Black Myth Wukong was finally released, but I don't have time recently. In a few days, I might take a day off. (laughs)</p>
