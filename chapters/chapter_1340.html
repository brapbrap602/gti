<h1>Chapter 1332: The True Celestial Palace</h1><p>Chapter 1332: The True Celestial Palace</p><p>Qin Sang and the others arrived below the passage.</p><p>This place was a barren mountaintop, devoid of any ancient prohibitions.  This was highly unusual within the perilous God of Sin Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended a peak and saw spatial fissures ahead, filled with spatial turbulence and fragments of ancient prohibitions. They were nearing the edge of the God of Sin Palace.</p><p>He focused his mind on his dantian.</p><p>The fragment of the Killing Sword lay quietly in his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He had traversed the God of Sin Palace, and the sword spirit remained unresponsive. It seemed there were no other fragments here.</p><p>"It's almost certain there's no second Killing Sword fragment in the Northern Star Realm.  I must leave for the other three realms, or search the Demon Sea,"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>A wisp of five-colored mist drifted before him.</p><p>He touched it, and the mist dispersed, revealing nothing unusual.</p><p>The five-colored mist diffused around them, continuously emanating from the lightning ring.</p><p>Master Cang Hong cautiously flew below the lightning ring. After investigating, he let out a soft exclamation, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>Everyone was watching Master Cang Hong, and upon seeing his reaction, their hearts tightened, and they asked what had happened.</p><p>"Everything inside the passage is normal," Master Cang Hong said, his tone odd, "This five-colored mist seems to be drifting in from the other side of the passage…"</p><p>The other side of the passage was the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Could something have happened in the Ziwei Palace?</p><p>Everyone looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>"Since the passage is normal, let's go and see!"</p><p>Daoist Zhen said solemnly.</p><p>Everyone gathered at the passage entrance.</p><p>This passage was different. If everyone used the appropriate secret techniques, they could pass through simultaneously and reach the Ziwei Palace. The exit was at the edge of the outer hall's demon hole, eliminating the risk of being ambushed and defeated one by one by Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Everyone summoned their treasures, prepared for any eventuality, and sat cross-legged in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Demon-Binding Rope; Qing Jun had given him this treasure earlier.</p><p>He glanced back. Qing Jun and Jing Yu hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>At that moment, Qing Jun and Jing Yu were still within the forbidden area.</p><p>"This woman's mastery of puppetry has likely reached the pinnacle!"</p><p>Jing Yu thought, watching Qing Jun.</p><p>At least, among the cultivators she had encountered, no one could compare with Qing Jun in puppetry.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang, they were friends, not enemies.</p><p>But for some reason, Jing Yu felt an inexplicable apprehension towards Qing Jun.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang's reputation in the cultivation world was immense, rivaling Old Demon Ye, even surpassing veteran powerhouses such as Daoist Zhen and Demon Lord Tongyou.</p><p>What was even more remarkable was his youth.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, the future of the Northern Star Realm would belong to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qing Jun was far more low-key.</p><p>She, under the guise of Leng Yuntian, only showed her prowess in the Blood Lake, matching Old Demon Ye blow for blow. Yet, she was ultimately outmaneuvered and had the Jade Bone Silk Skin taken by Old Demon Ye, her achievements overshadowed by Qin Sang's.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s strength was openly displayed; his personal cultivation was not that high.</p><p>His lightning escape technique, top-tier treasures, powerful demonic fire, puppets, corpse refinement—these trump cards were impossible to conceal; once used, they would be remembered.</p><p>Recalling her few encounters with Qing Jun, Jing Yu always felt Qing Jun was inscrutable and mysterious.  This wasn't based on concrete evidence, simply a gut feeling.</p><p>"It must be an illusion. Concealing strength in front of Old Demon Ye is tantamount to suicide,"</p><p>Jing Yu secretly chided herself.  Imprisoned for two hundred years, she was becoming overly cautious.</p><p>As she was lost in thought, Qing Jun put away the Qingluan puppet, flew out of the seal, and shook her head slightly, having found nothing.</p><p>…</p><p>The passage entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others simultaneously formed hand seals, and talismans formed from spiritual energy appeared before them, shining silver, connecting with the passage.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>The moment the talismans were completed, everyone struck the passage simultaneously.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The talismans shattered, turning into specks of light, half drifting into the passage, the other half falling onto them.</p><p>Everyone felt a tightening sensation, and everything in their vision suddenly disappeared into darkness. They were pulled upward by a gentle force, initially slowly, then faster and faster.</p><p>They didn't know how far they had been carried.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang felt the pulling force disappear, realizing they had entered the demon hole. He was about to activate his treasures to be on guard when a deafening roar echoed above him.</p><p>It sounded like the heavens were collapsing!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart shuddered, his expression changing.</p><p>At that moment, the others appeared around him, also shocked by the enormous sound.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, quickly flying towards the exit of the Demon Cave.  They found five-colored mist swirling in the void, clearly emanating from Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>The moment they flew out of the Demon Cave, everyone was stunned by the sight before them.</p><p>Ye Laomo was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>But that was no longer important. They stared blankly towards the inner hall of Purple Micro Palace, their faces displaying shock and disbelief.</p><p>Master Zhen, Tongyou Demon Lord, had both entered Purple Micro Palace several times.</p><p>Even Qin Sang was entering for the third time.</p><p>In the past, the inner hall of Purple Micro Palace was very peaceful, less dangerous than the outer halls.  Cultivators at the Golden Core stage could move freely as long as they didn't trespass into the forbidden areas.</p><p>Mount Heaven, Sword Scar Mountain, Hanging Garden Palace, Ancient Medicine Garden, Immortal City Ruins…</p><p>These forbidden areas were heavily guarded, but stable; their power never manifested outwardly.</p><p>Now, it was completely different!</p><p>The inner hall was extremely unstable, the void violently shaking. All the ancient prohibitions were activated, their power revealed.  The hidden secret realms and forbidden areas were all laid bare before them.</p><p>The Immortal City, was obliterated by a single hand, leaving behind a giant handprint. The remaining ancient prohibitions were activated, creating an illusion of the city. Though shattered, its former splendor was still evident.</p><p>Sword Scar Mountain, its illusionary landscape appeared, covering the surrounding mountains. From within, a shocking sword energy soared into the sky, shattering the illusion with a power that seemed to cleave the heavens.</p><p>The Ancient Medicine Garden, was enveloped by a halo of profound light, each covering a large expanse of spirit fields.  A faint treasure light emanated from within, clearly indicating the presence of extraordinary spirit herbs never before seen.</p><p>At the center of the Ancient Medicine Garden, a secret realm appeared out of thin air.  A spirit tree, its canopy like clouds, shielded the sky, protecting this damaged secret realm.  Life flourished within, mist swirling, and an air of mystery hung heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized it: this was the Hanging Garden Palace, the mysterious place that birthed Yunyouzi and Nine Illusory Sky Orchid. He had planned to explore it!</p><p>He also saw a ruined palace.</p><p>The Gathering Spirit Hall had also appeared.  It was from the Gathering Spirit Hall's altar that the Three Lights Jade Liquid was obtained.</p><p>Mount Heaven's peak was filled with strange phenomena. Images of celestial palaces flickered in and out of existence, uncertain whether they were real or illusions, similar to the celestial palace on Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>…</p><p>These were merely a glimpse of the inner hall. Whether previously discovered or unknown, all the secret realms were now revealed.</p><p>This was the true Celestial Palace!</p><p>The true Purple Micro Palace!</p><p>Everyone was in utter shock and disbelief.</p><p>One cultivator murmured, "Could this be the work of Ye Laomo and the demons?"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Thanks to the generous contribution from the esteemed patron Qi Zhi You Zou!</p>
