<h1>Chapter 1034: The Scheme</h1><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Master Ye!”</p><p>Only when the clouds dispersed and the thunder subsided, and the old man landed before them, did the crowd come to their senses and hurriedly step forward to pay their respects.</p><p>The newcomer was the renowned Venerable Ye of the East Pole Alliance. He was deeply trusted by the Alliance Leader and was responsible for training the Alliance's rising stars. Everyone present, including Sunü, had received Venerable Ye’s guidance and regarded him as their master.</p><p>No one noticed the deepening gloom in Sunü’s eyes.</p><p>Venerable Ye had actually snuck in here!</p><p>What was the Alliance plotting?</p><p>Venerable Ye closed his eyes, withdrew his sword light, and then his aura shifted. Using some unknown secret technique, his presence became faint, almost undetectable.</p><p>He had sealed a portion of his cultivation.</p><p>Looking over the group, Venerable Ye frowned. “Why are there only a few of you?”</p><p>The elder with the long beard stepped forward and respectfully replied, “Reporting to Master, Third Junior Brother was delayed at the Glacial Plains in the second trial. First Junior Brother entered the final trial with us, but for some unknown reason, he hasn’t appeared. He might have encountered some trouble and is trapped…”</p><p>“Unable to even pass the Glacial Plains? Don’t mention you’ve received my guidance when you leave!”</p><p>Venerable Ye snorted coldly and said indifferently, “Forget it. If they can’t even pass this small test, it means they don’t have the fortune! Erase the traces here, we’ll go retrieve the Soul Cleansing Elixir first.”</p><p>Venerable Ye’s tone was casual, as if the Soul Cleansing Elixir was already in his grasp.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was first stunned, then overjoyed.</p><p>After seeing Venerable Ye, they had all been lost in thought, speculating about the purpose of his clandestine arrival.</p><p>Learning that Venerable Ye intended to lead them to obtain the Soul Cleansing Elixir, they were all pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Originally, even if they joined forces, although they had a good chance of seizing the Soul Cleansing Elixir, it was hard to say how many portions they could obtain. The successors of both the righteous and demonic paths, as well as various other factions, were all formidable opponents.</p><p>It was almost impossible for everyone to get a portion of the Soul Cleansing Elixir.</p><p>But with Venerable Ye’s intervention, it was a different story.</p><p>A Nascent Soul ancestor renowned throughout the Canglang Sea, a Venerable of the Alliance, competing with Core Formation cultivators for the Soul Cleansing Elixir – wouldn't it be an easy task?</p><p>“Master, did you come specifically to help us compete for the Soul Cleansing Elixir?”</p><p>The charming woman’s large eyes blinked, unable to conceal her delight, her voice sweet and innocent.</p><p>Venerable Ye chuckled. “Do you know how much the Alliance Leader and the Alliance have sacrificed to send me in? Obtaining the Soul Cleansing Elixir is merely incidental. With such a treasure before us, how could we not take it? After obtaining the Soul Cleansing Elixir, there are even more important matters to attend to.”</p><p>The charming woman gasped, a hint of worry in her eyes. “Master, what important matter has the Alliance Leader sent you to do? Will it be dangerous?”</p><p>“The most dangerous moment has already passed…”</p><p>Venerable Ye recalled the time he waded through the radiant light, still filled with lingering fear. Not only were the protective treasures prepared by the Alliance for him completely depleted, but he himself had also suffered serious injuries.</p><p>And that was only at the edge of the radiant light. He didn't know how terrifying the true Immortal Prohibition was.</p><p>After a pause, Venerable Ye surveyed the surroundings. “It seems there’s been quite a commotion here! It’s not convenient for me to act freely here. We’ll need to plan carefully when seizing the Soul Cleansing Elixir. Let's leave this place first to avoid being discovered.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone erased their traces and followed Venerable Ye as they flew out of the deep valley, avoiding the eyes and ears of others.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Streams of escaping light sped towards the valley.</p><p>They looked at the ravaged valley, glancing at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>After searching fruitlessly, they gradually dispersed.</p><p>On a mountain not far from the stone peak.</p><p>Mingwei had already arrived, seeing the mark left by Qin Sang, and rushed over to meet up.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of a floating peak, gazing at the deep valley, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>When Venerable Ye snuck in, the sky above the Trial Realm was filled with turbulent winds and dense thunderclouds, as if heavenly punishment was descending. The ferocious beasts in the mountains went into chaos, and the cultivators were filled with fear.</p><p>The area around the deep valley was the most affected.</p><p>The strange phenomenon appeared and disappeared quickly.</p><p>Soon, the Trial Realm returned to its normal calm.</p><p>But for some reason, Qin Sang had a lingering sense of unease.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mingwei, has this kind of phenomenon ever occurred in the Trial Realm before?” Qin Sang turned and asked.</p><p>Mingwei stood beside Qin Sang. She was full of energy, having easily passed the final trial.</p><p>She gently shook her head, stating with certainty, “No! More than one senior from our sect has participated. Before my master reached Nascent Soul, she entered the Trial Realm and obtained a portion of the Soul Cleansing Elixir. A hundred years ago, a senior brother of mine came to the inner hall alone. Although he didn't obtain the Soul Cleansing Elixir, he successfully entered the final trial.  None of them encountered such a phenomenon.”</p><p>“I hope it’s not related to the Soul Cleansing Elixir.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly.</p><p>Mingwei didn’t think so. “That place is quite far from where the Soul Cleansing Elixir appears. It shouldn’t be related. We should still consider how to ensure we obtain the Soul Cleansing Elixir without fail.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and looked away.</p><p>Just now, Mingwei had kept her oath, informing him of the information related to the Soul Cleansing Elixir and the true function of the Life Talisman.</p><p>They were discussing when they were interrupted by the strange phenomenon.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang saw some cultivators arriving one after another and entering the stone peak, including disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but Ning Wu Hui was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>It seemed he could only cooperate with Mingwei.</p><p>The Life Talisman could be used three times in the Trial Realm.</p><p>When activated in danger, it would connect with the restrictions within the secret realm, providing protection. Under the protection of the Life Talisman, opponents would immediately lose their target.</p><p>They couldn't see or sense them; it was like being in two separate worlds.</p><p>The opponents encountered in the Trial Realm wouldn't exceed the Core Formation stage, making it impossible for them to see through the Life Talisman. However, the Life Talisman wasn't without limitations. After activation, one could only stay in place and couldn't go anywhere. If one fell into a dangerous environment, it could only delay the inevitable.</p><p>Previously, Mingwei had used the Life Talisman once to escape danger, leaving two uses remaining.</p><p>With more and more cultivators gathering, the Soul Cleansing Elixir was about to appear.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Elixir wasn't in the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The Treasure Pavilion was built on the peak of the stone peak, but the Soul Cleansing Elixir was hidden deep within an underground cavern.</p><p>“The cavern is about to open. Let’s go.”</p><p>Mingwei seemed a little impatient.</p><p>The two of them flew up, heading north towards the stone peak.</p><p>Along the way, they deliberately separated, and Mingwei also changed her attire to avoid being targeted because she possessed the Life Talisman.</p><p>Deep within the mountain range was a unique ring-shaped mountain.</p><p>Compared to other peaks, the ring-shaped mountain wasn't tall. What was peculiar was that a cold, black fog, not found elsewhere, gathered within the mountain. Entering the range of this mountain, one could feel a chill emanating from within.</p><p>At this moment, scattered figures hovered around the ring-shaped mountain.</p><p>They observed and guarded against each other, occasionally glancing towards the depths of the black fog, their eyes flashing with eagerness and fervor.</p><p>Two individuals among them were the most eye-catching.</p><p>One wore a Daoist robe, with a precious sword hanging from his waist, appearing elegant and extraordinary.</p><p>The other wore a blood-red robe embroidered with a blood bat baring its fangs, but his face was so pale that it appeared ghastly.</p>
