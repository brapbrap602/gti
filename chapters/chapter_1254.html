<h1>Chapter 1246: Subduing the Puppet</h1><p>Having flown out of the hills, Qin Sang discovered that Gongliang Yu's talisman formation remained intact, but Dongyang Bo was nowhere to be seen.  He wondered where he'd gone.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, thinking to himself that Dongyang Bo, having lost both his essence blood and his magic treasures, might not participate in the struggle with Zuoyuan anymore.</p><p>He spread his wings and flew to a distant mountain peak, observing the cave entrance from afar.</p><p>The battle with Dongyang Bo had awakened a sleeping monster at the bottom of the Blood River.  Qin Sang didn't want an unnecessary fight, so he left without even looking at the creature, unsure of its strength or origin.  Even before it awoke, Qin Sang felt a palpable threat; it was clearly not benevolent.  If this creature remained near the Blood Lake entrance, his departure might be fraught with further complications.</p><p>He stared at the cave opening.  Streams of blood mist gushed out, followed by a swarm of bloody figures scrambling out, seemingly in a panic from a terrifying enemy.  Once outside the thick blood mist, these figures, lacking support, flew about wildly like headless flies, triggering ancient prohibitions and vanishing into dust.</p><p>The chaos was brief; the cave mouth quickly returned to calm.  After observing for a while and seeing no further changes, Qin Sang decided to leave it alone. He flew to a secluded spot and placed the talisman puppet on the ground.</p><p>The puppet roared wildly. The jade bottle containing it was cracked, and the containment was failing.  Its unruly nature explained Gongliang Yu's cautious handling.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the puppet, at a loss. His only recourse was to subdue it temporarily, planning to study how to completely control it later.</p><p>He sat down, sending his consciousness into the puppet's body. He was immediately shocked.</p><p>"Good heavens! What a mess!"</p><p>The puppet's core contained a multitude of ghostly images.  The moment they sensed Qin Sang's consciousness, they all turned to look at him, making his hair stand on end.  Immediately afterwards, Qin Sang felt something trying to tear apart his spirit, as these ghostly images went berserk, swarming towards him like a horde of ghosts in the night.</p><p>"What kind of cursed puppet is this!  It’s definitely an evil puppet!"</p><p>Even with the jade Buddha protecting him, Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine.  He wondered what kind of heretical techniques Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had used to create such a chaotic puppet.</p><p>It would be impossible to sort things out quickly.  Taking advantage of the jade bottle's formation still suppressing the puppet, Qin Sang used countless different restrictive techniques, finally using demonic fire to forcibly seal it.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The formation shattered.</p><p>A black light shot into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The puppet, now sealed into a small figurine the size of his hand, was restless.  Demoniac flames swirled around it, forming tadpole-shaped black runes, seemingly embedded in it, temporarily sealing it away.</p><p>“Master, where are we going now?”</p><p>Fat Chicken, released by Qin Sang, looked anxious. Their search for its mother had been disrupted by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's attempt to kill Gongliang Yu, followed by Qin Sang's duel with Dongyang Bo, hadn't taken long, although the preceding tracking had.</p><p>Qin Sang took a moment to recover, then rose to his feet.  “Let’s quickly check the outer perimeter and rejoin the others.”</p><p>His identity having been inadvertently exposed, Qin Sang needed to find the Thunderhawk Yao Wang.  This would not only provide a legitimate Yao Wang for Qianshan Bamboo Sea, satisfying the Yao race, but would also give him a valuable ally.  His life wouldn’t consist entirely of fighting and killing anymore.</p><p>Now that both sides were openly confronting each other, both would be cautious, leaving little chance for a sudden attack. Qin Sang’s foundation in the cultivation world was shallow compared to Dongyang Bo’s. As he aimed to establish the Qingyang Temple lineage, the future of both sects would be affected by their feud.  Building alliances, making the other party think twice, and a gradual approach were the better strategy.</p><p>Taking Fat Chicken with him, Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword and used sword-based teleportation to quickly traverse the outer perimeter.</p><p>Fat Chicken's Thunder Bead remained unresponsive.  If the Thunderhawk Yao Wang was still alive, it could only be deep within the Blood Lake.</p><p>Fat Chicken was despondent.  With the dangers on the surface, the Blood Lake's depths were unimaginable. Even if its mother was strong, survival there was improbable.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang and Fat Chicken were traversing the mountain range.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang landed on a mountain peak, gazing at the towering peaks ahead. Dozens of mountain ranges rose in an orderly fashion, like a series of steps.</p><p>“Master, I think it’s there!”</p><p>Fat Chicken pointed a wing towards the highest peak in the distance.</p><p>The summit of that mountain was strangely flat, as if leveled by some unknown force, forming a vast platform.  This was the meeting point for the Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, surprised. "There's no one here. Have they all gone in already?"</p><p>He moved swiftly, leaping onto the stone platform.  His vision suddenly broadened.  No more mountain ranges obstructed his view.</p><p>Before him lay an extraordinarily wide basin, shrouded in a bloody mist.  The mist surged like a tide.  Even with the keen eyesight of a Sky-Eye Butterfly, it was impossible to penetrate the mist and see what lay beneath.</p><p>This was different from the Blood River they had encountered before. There were no moving blood figures, but the blood mist here was thick with ancient prohibitions, far more dangerous than the Blood River.</p><p>According to their research, the depths of the Blood Lake were this mist-shrouded basin.  Years ago, the Blood Lake seal somehow loosened, and a phantom of a Wu Jian Blood Mulberry appeared, reflecting in the Blood Lake, and was discovered.  Several senior cultivators then broke the seal and entered, reaching this platform, where they saw the main body of the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry floating in the blood mist.</p><p>One senior cultivator, using incredible power on this platform, managed to retrieve the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry.  Why they then turned against each other, shattering the tree, and what happened afterwards, remains unknown.</p><p>The scattered pieces of the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry are incomplete.  They suspect some parts might have fallen into the basin. Thus, their journey wasn't solely to disrupt Ye Lao Mo's scheme, but also to search for the divine tree.</p><p>Standing there, Qin Sang gazed into the distance, noticing a dark spot in the middle of the basin within the blood mist. Upon closer inspection, it resembled the peak of a structure.</p><p>"Master, there's a message here," shouted Pang Ji, arriving at the edge of the platform with a new discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang saw it too.  On the edge of the platform, a message formed from condensed true energy floated on the surface of a bloodstone, subtly concealed.  It had been jointly reinforced by the several figures using special methods; it was authentic.  This included Tongyou Mojun, Xiang Qing, Chongyi Daozhang, Qing Jun, and others—essentially, most of the strongest cultivators in Xiao Han Domain, except for Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The message essentially stated that they had discovered an unusual situation in the depths of the basin shortly after arriving, fearing it was Ye Lao Mo's doing.  Unable to wait for everyone to assemble, they had proceeded ahead, marking the direction and noting dangers along the way for others to follow.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around but saw none of the anomalies they described.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I haven't fully recovered yet.  I've been working late nights and am quite exhausted. I'll only write one chapter today; consider it a day off. I will catch up on the previously owed chapter as soon as possible within the next two days.</p>
