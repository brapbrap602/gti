<h1>Chapter 1964: Opening the Meridian</h1><p>The storm intensified.</p><p>Chaotic power surged around Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>These were not enough to threaten his life.</p><p>But after falling for some distance, Bai Li Qingkong suddenly felt a sense of foreboding. He raised his right hand flat in front of his chest, revealing a palm-sized bronze disc.</p><p>The surface of the bronze disc was polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting the scene ahead.  Within its reflection, swirling currents of chaotic energy were clearly visible.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong's expression grew grave. He had glimpsed a strange, humanoid shadow within the turbulent flow, moving like a phantom, then vanishing in an instant.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong extended a finger, pointing into the void.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing screech echoed from the tip of his finger. A figure materialized, rushing towards Bai Li Qingkong with a bloodcurdling roar, its voice filled with madness and bloodlust.</p><p>Upon seeing the figure's appearance, Bai Li Qingkong's brow furrowed.</p><p>Its features were twisted, its limbs elongated, more grotesque than any ghost. It was a demonic creature he had never seen before.  This monster was mindless, incapable of communication, attacking any living being in its path.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong discerned the monster's nature. The bronze mirror flew from his hand, circling above the monster's head, leaving a crimson trail in its wake.</p><p>Like a fiery rope, it suddenly tightened, coiling around the monster's neck, crimson flames engulfing its body.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the monster wasn't incinerated on the spot.  Black mist erupted from its seven orifices, coming into contact with the crimson flames and staining them a dark, bloody red.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Seeing this, Bai Li Qingkong realized this monster was not simple. He wondered how many more lay below.</p><p>If the monsters were swarming in hordes, it would be a significant problem.</p><p>Monsters didn't appear without a reason. Their presence here likely meant they were guarding something.</p><p>This also suggested that they might have found the core of the Heavenly Meridian Sect’s ruins!</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Bai Li Qingkong made a hand seal. The crimson flames surged, trapping the monster but not killing it.</p><p>Leaving the monster alive would serve as a deterrent to any followers.</p><p>As expected, as he continued to descend, monsters began to appear in twos and threes.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong employed various techniques, avoiding entanglement with the monsters and diving downwards with utmost speed.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Deep within the darkness, lives were being mercilessly harvested.</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha removed his finger from a cultivator's forehead, indifferently watching as the earth absorbed the blood from the cultivator’s corpse.  He glanced into the distance and then vanished into the ground.</p><p>As time passed, the murals on the stone pool absorbed more and more blood, emitting a妖异blood-red glow.</p><p>The murals were scattered throughout the ruins, connected by an invisible link.  All the murals formed a giant formation diagram that covered the entire ruins.</p><p>The formation's eye was the bottomless ancient well.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong continued his descent, losing track of how deep he had traveled.</p><p>Finally, he sensed a chilling aura emanating from below, accompanied by unusual fluctuations.</p><p>Pausing momentarily, Bai Li Qingkong glanced upwards, activating the bronze mirror, which began to orbit him protectively, as he cautiously descended further.</p><p>Surprisingly, he passed through the cold region without incident.</p><p>As if passing through a barrier, the temperature returned to normal, and all the clamor was shut out.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong entered a pitch-black space.  There was no sound, a silence so profound it was unsettling.</p><p>Even stranger, the glowing orbs that had initially drawn them here had vanished.</p><p>Standing in the empty depths, Bai Li Qingkong couldn't help but recall the various strange encounters he'd experienced. Despite possessing Nascent Soul cultivation, he felt inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A faint rustle of wind was exceptionally jarring in the silence.</p><p>“Who's there!”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong’s expression shifted slightly. He had just swept the area with his divine sense.</p><p>Without hesitation, he channeled his divine sense, sweeping it outwards with brute force.</p><p>The other party made no attempt to conceal themselves, stepping out of the darkness.</p><p>A faint light illuminated the space, revealing a single figure – the young man surnamed Sha.</p><p>“Bai Li Qingkong, one of the three Nascent Soul Patriarchs of the Bai Li Clan.  My respects! My respects!”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong felt a deep discomfort meeting the young man's gaze. His eyes were too cold, as if looking at a dead man.</p><p>This boded ill!</p><p>However, a mere Golden Core cultivator, how much power could he possibly possess to be so arrogant?</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong had seen through the young man's cultivation level at a glance.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Patriarch, even injured, wouldn't be threatened by a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Yet, an inexplicable unease began to creep into his heart, growing stronger with each passing moment.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong focused his senses, but detected no other presence.</p><p>"As expected, noblemen forget easily.  You no longer recognize this humble one. However, I will forever remember the gift your Bai Li Clan bestowed upon my family two hundred years ago!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha spoke with an icy tone.</p><p>"Two hundred years ago?"</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong finally recalled something, staring intently at the young man.  The more he looked, the more familiar his features seemed.</p><p>His expression changed slightly as he blurted out, “You’re that missing bastard of the Sha family!”</p><p>“Bastard…”</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha burst into laughter, a mixture of hatred and bitterness.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong’s words confirmed one thing – he was the only survivor, the last of the Sha bloodline!</p><p>“Weeds must be uprooted, or they will become a scourge!”</p><p>A sneer curled Bai Li Qingkong's lips.</p><p>It was clear this was a trap.</p><p>The Yin family had always been cautious, rarely making enemies in the cultivation world. Bai Li Qingkong had never imagined this would be a conspiracy targeting him!</p><p>“The Clan Leader was right. The Sha family were nothing but a bunch of brutes! You survived, yet instead of continuing the Sha family line, you dare appear before me! Who gave you the courage, Yin Heqian?”</p><p>The young man surnamed Sha remained unmoved, replying coldly, "There's no need to probe, Daoist.  It's just you and me here. No one else."</p><p>He looked up into the darkness above and said softly, "A thousand years ago, the Sha family discovered the location of the Heavenly Meridian Sect ruins, but generations of elders exhausted their lives without being able to open them."</p><p>“But you opened it!”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong sneered, “What are you trying to say? That you're a once-in-a-millennium genius, superior to all those Sha family brutes?”</p><p>“I dare not disrespect my ancestors, but I also won’t underestimate myself. Of course, I must thank you for helping me break the final restriction!”</p><p>The young man spread his arms. A strange glint flashed in his eyes, and a peculiar fluctuation emanated from his body, spreading into the surrounding darkness.</p><p>“I only learned later that the Meridian Profound Pagoda wasn’t a pagoda at all!”</p><p>These seemingly disjointed words caused Bai Li Qingkong's face to drain of color.</p><p>Suddenly, he understood. “You!”</p><p>At that moment, a妖异blood-red light emerged from the darkness. Countless blood threads snaked out from all directions, converging on the young man's body.</p><p>These blood threads resembled the meridians of a human body, piercing into the young man and connecting with his own meridians. A power unlike anything Bai Li Qingkong had ever witnessed flowed continuously into him through the blood threads.</p><p>“The Heavenly Meridian Sect’s true inheritance, the Heavenly Meridian Heart诀! When cultivated to great completion, it allows one to cultivate a Heavenly Meridian within their body using their own meridians! The Meridian Profound Pagoda is a sacred ground for meridian cultivation. Its passages are like meridians, and the stone pools correspond to the acupoints of the human body. Supplemented by the Heavenly Meridian Sect’s secret Yellow Court Divine Liquid, it can open one’s meridians. Unfortunately, I don't know how to refine the Yellow Court Divine Liquid, so I had to find another way, using the essence blood of cultivators to forcibly activate the Meridian Profound Pagoda's grand formation. However, I still lacked a main ingredient to stabilize the major acupoint!”</p><p>The young man was enveloped by blood threads, practically becoming a blood cocoon. His icy voice emanated from within.</p><p>It was clear that the blood threads originated from the slain cultivators.</p><p>The young man had orchestrated a grand scheme. His final target, and the greatest variable, was Bai Li Qingkong before him!</p><p>“Using me as an ingredient?”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong roared with laughter, as if he had heard the greatest joke.</p><p>“You courting death!”</p><p>Firelight illuminated the entire space.</p><p>Over a hundred fist-sized fire thunderbolts materialized before Bai Li Qingkong, shooting outwards like a torrential downpour.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The fire thunderbolts exploded one after another, yet they couldn’t sever the blood threads.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai Li Qingkong immediately directed all the remaining fire thunderbolts towards the young man.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator facing this attack would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>Yet, the young man didn't dodge. He pushed his palms forward, a sound like wind and thunder emanating from within his body.</p><p>His palms overlapped, unleashing a blood-red halo. Just as the fire thunderbolts detonated, the halo enveloped them all.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The fire thunderbolts exploded simultaneously.</p><p>The earth shook!</p><p>The halo shattered, yet it had miraculously withstood the terrifying impact of the fire thunderbolts.</p><p>The young man couldn’t possess such power on his own. He must have drawn some kind of power from the Meridian Profound Pagoda, instantly gaining strength comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>The young man, who had just displayed such formidable power, suddenly began coughing violently, his upper body almost doubling over in pain.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong’s shock turned to joy. He burst out laughing, “Arrogant child, you dare attempt to control Nascent Soul power? See how long before you explode!”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the bronze mirror behind him rose into the air, hanging upside down, flames flickering on its surface.</p><p>The young man wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, staring coldly at the bronze mirror.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>He opened a jade bottle in his hand. A pill rolled out, the very one he had obtained from the Azure Ram Temple.</p><p>He swallowed the pill. A refreshing energy flowed through his body, significantly alleviating his pain. He could finally control the chaotic power within him.</p><p>The young man was overjoyed. This pill was truly exceptional, its potency even greater than he had anticipated!</p><p>He felt an boundless power surging within him, filling him with infinite confidence. Seeing the approaching bronze mirror, he didn't hesitate to counterattack.</p><p>An injured Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator empowered by external forces to possess Nascent Soul strength.</p><p>A life-or-death struggle unfolded in the depths of the ancient well.</p><p>Yin Heqian was anxious to save others, and the rest had to carefully deal with the attacks of the demons.</p><p>No one disturbed them.</p><p>The aftershocks of their battle raged, creating utter chaos.</p><p>The young man fought with increasing ferocity, while Bai Li Qingkong felt his strength waning.</p><p>To his horror, he discovered that the Meridian Profound Pagoda not only amplified the young man's strength but also suppressed the power of others.</p><p>With the tide turning against him, he found himself at a disadvantage.</p><p>When he finally decided to retreat, he realized he couldn't find a way out. The moment he stepped into this space, the young man had secretly trapped him.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A figure was sent flying – it was Bai Li Qingkong.</p><p>“It's a pity I don't know the true method to activate the Meridian Profound Pagoda. I can only delay its self-destruction and can’t control the monsters guarding it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have needed to go through all this trouble!”</p><p>The young man looked utterly wretched, his body scorched black and covered in wounds.</p><p>But he was the last one standing!</p><p>He couldn't hide the excitement in his voice, despite having racked his brains, using every means to weaken his opponent and seizing every advantage of time and place.</p><p>Whether by schemes and tricks or an unfair victory, there was no disputing it – he had defeated a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator, taking the first step on his path to revenge!</p><p>"Remember! The one who will exterminate your entire Bai Li Clan is Sha Yu!"</p><p>The young man roared, filled with exhilaration!</p><p>“Generations of careful cultivation cannot compare to a single generation's genius!”</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong's arrogance was gone, replaced by a bitter laugh.</p><p>The Heavenly Meridian Heart诀 was incredibly powerful. It was said that even Heavenly Meridian Sect cultivators needed the Yellow Court Divine Liquid to mitigate the impact of the technique on their bodies, otherwise, it would damage their foundations, proving more harmful than beneficial in the long run.</p><p>Sha Yu, consumed by his desire for revenge, disregarded his own future, cultivating the Heavenly Meridian Heart诀 using methods akin to demonic cultivation. Once he mastered the technique, his power would surpass that of a true Heavenly Meridian Sect cultivator, far exceeding that of an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Of course, the price would be severe, likely affecting his lifespan.</p><p>This child was driven mad by hatred and possessed deep cunning.  Caught off guard, he had forced a powerful enemy into a desperate situation!</p><p>With such a relentless enemy, no sect could rest easy.</p><p>Bai Li Qingkong seemed to see the tragic future of the Bai Li Clan.</p><p>The legacy painstakingly built by generations of ancestors might be destroyed by this child's hands!</p><p>But he couldn't relay this message back to warn his clan!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The earth collapsed, mountains crumbled.</p><p>The cultivators on the surface, including Yin Heqian, were startled.</p><p>Yin Heqian suppressed his injuries, stood up, and looked ahead.</p><p>“The Heavenly Meridian Sect ruins are being destroyed. What in the world did that Bai Li Qingkong do?”</p><p>…</p><p>At the core of the ruins.</p><p>The Bai Li Qingkong Yin Heqian spoke of had become a crucial ingredient, fed to the Meridian Profound Pagoda.</p><p>As the Meridian Profound Pagoda teetered on the brink of collapse, Sha Yu remained unmoved, seizing the final moment before its self-destruction to open his own meridian!</p><p>A torrent of power surged into his body. Sha Yu felt his meridians being shredded, then kneaded into a ball, then scattered, repeating endlessly, inflicting immeasurable pain.</p><p>Finally, he grasped something in the midst of this torment. He slammed his palm against his dantian, unleashing a torrent of true essence.</p><p>As if breaking through a barrier, a new path appeared within him, a new meridian born within his flesh and blood.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Meridian!</p><p>…</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder roared, fierce winds howled within a certain mountain range.</p><p>After the Three Disasters Tribulation, the surroundings were devastated, unrecognizable.</p><p>A figure slowly rose from the ruins, laughing towards the heavens, “Heaven has been kind to me, Sha Yu, allowing me to overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation! After I slaughter all my enemies, I shall offer my respects to the heavens!”</p><p>His aura was brimming with ambition, and also, with boundless killing intent!</p><p>Suppressing his killing intent, Sha Yu pondered his next move in his quest for revenge.</p><p>The Bai Li Clan had lost Bai Li Qingkong, but they still had two Nascent Soul Patriarchs. He couldn't confront them directly…</p><p>Just then, a streak of light shot towards him.</p><p>Sha Yu caught it, his eyes widening as he read the message. He then hastily departed.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at a mountain range, the very Guanyang Mountain where the Bai Li Clan resided.</p><p>Now, dark clouds gathered above Guanyang Mountain, and numerous figures were launching a fierce assault on the clan below!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
