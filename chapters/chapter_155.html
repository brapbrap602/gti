<h1>Chapter 148: The Technique Is a Tool</h1><p>Chapter 148: The Technique Is a Tool</p><p>The Path of Slaughter encompasses all things, and there are also thousands of great paths.</p><p>Qin Sang did not know what was the correct path for cultivating the [Chapter of Nurturing the Soul-Protecting Sword]. In fact, the choices of every cultivator were possibly different.</p><p>During his time cultivating this technique, Senior Qingzhu, in order to comprehend the Killing Talisman, might have given himself to the Path of Slaughter. It is possible that he killed all he encountered, be they male, female, old, young, mortal, or cultivator, thereby eventually falling into the Demonic Path. It is also possible that he proactively threw himself into the heart of danger, in hopes of finding life between life and death, eradicating fear from his heart, slaying others, and also slaying his former self. It is also possible that he traveled alone with his sword, going wherever his heart took him, only seeking for spiritual fulfillment. Or it is possible that he used killing to stop killing…</p><p>But Qin Sang definitely could not take this path.</p><p>If he did not have the jade Buddha to protect his Soul, which prevented the killing intent from corrupting him, while meditating on the Killing Talisman during battle, once his consciousness was overcome by the killing intent, losing his rationality, and he became unable to calmly analyze the situation, with only “kill, kill, kill” remaining in his mind, he would place himself in an extremely dangerous situation.</p><p>Qin Sang had also pondered for a long time before deciding to try this path.</p><p>If it proved effective, then this path was certainly the most suitable for him.</p><p>In his view, the [Chapter of Nurturing the Soul-Protecting Sword] was only a tool for him to raise his cultivation. Because of Senior Qingzhu’s example, even with his inferior talent he could still see a glimmer of hope of forming his Golden Core, so that was why he had chosen this technique. It was not because he yearned for the Path of Slaughter, nor was it because he was moved by the technique.</p><p>The only obsession in his heart was longevity.</p><p>If possible, Qin Sang never wanted to change his style and principles just because of cultivating a technique.</p><p>Just as he was willing to sacrifice himself as a cauldron for the sake of forming his Foundation, regardless of the choices he made, he followed his true heart. It was not out of confusion, so he could have no regrets!</p><p>Of course, if he had no other choice, then that would be another matter.</p><p>The killing intent within the sword qi grew denser, but Qin Sang remained incredibly calm, his heart still as water. He was only doing this to use the Killing Talisman to simulate a killing intent to understand the Killing Talisman in actual combat.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind linked with the Ebony Sword. The Spiritual Sword’s killing intent surged to the sky, as it ruthlessly thrust towards the White Rhino Demonic Beast. The sword qi was like a knife…</p><p>……</p><p>The disciples at the Spirit Stone Mine waited anxiously for a full day and night. In the beginning, they could still see lights flashing through the sky, and then the Yun Cang Great Marsh began to surge, affecting the Spirit Stone Mine’s island, constantly shaking it, which showed how intense the distant battle was.</p><p>But once dawn arrived, everything fell completely silent, and Senior Martial Uncle Qin still had not returned.</p><p>Without any sign from Qin Sang, they did not dare open up the great formation, nor did they dare go out and investigate the outcome of the battle. Had the demonic beast won, or had their Martial Uncle from the sect won?</p><p>申有道 was flying in the air, close to the formation’s light barrier. His eyes were wide open as he stared at the horizon like a lovesick fool, constantly praying for Senior Martial Uncle Qin to hurry back. Even if he was missing an arm or a leg, as long as he could escape back alive, that would be good enough.</p><p>“If Senior Martial Uncle Qin still hasn’t returned by the late hours of the morning, we’ll send a message to the sect to ask for help!”</p><p>申有道 was restless and anxious, his voice a little hoarse.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator faced off against a demonic beast that had just awakened its spiritual intelligence. He could not possibly not even have the ability to escape, right?</p><p>If Senior Martial Uncle Qin were to die at the hands of the demonic beast, but they as disciples hid within the great formation, they would definitely be severely punished by the sect. He was no longer young, and he had already given up on the idea of cultivating. He originally wanted to accumulate some wealth at the Spirit Stone Mine and then return home to marry a few beautiful women and live a life of comfort, enjoying life for the next few decades. He had never expected to encounter this kind of setback.</p><p>Suddenly, a huge figure appeared on the distant horizon, flying in the air towards them. It was the incredibly ferocious White Rhino Demonic Beast!</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>申有道’s heart thumped, his eyes wide with fear, almost fainting.</p><p>Just then, a cheer suddenly rose up from below. “Senior Martial Uncle Qin won! He killed that evil demon!”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>申有道, who had already been considering having a child to carry on his family name, hurriedly opened his eyes wide. Only then did he notice that there was a figure under the enormous body of the White Rhino Demonic Beast. Who else could it be other than Senior Martial Uncle Qin?</p><p>It turned out that the demon had been killed by Senior Martial Uncle Qin, who was casually holding it up with one hand. He hadn’t been able to see that because he was so worried.</p><p>“Quick! Quickly open the formation and welcome back Senior Martial Uncle Qin!”</p><p>申有道 could not stop grinning.</p><p>He saw Senior Martial Uncle Qin fly towards the island at an incredible speed, and as 申有道 opened his mouth to say something flattering, a voice came from above. “Bear witness: this demon has been slain by me. Send word of this to the sect, and then take good care of the Spirit Mine. Do not slack off.”</p><p>After saying this, Qin Sang tossed the White Rhino Demonic Beast’s corpse into his mustard seed pouch and flew off into the distance, amidst the disciples’ disappointed gazes.</p><p>Despite trapping the Rhinoceros Demon in the Samsara Trapping Formation and gaining an advantage, the water controlling ability of the Rhinoceros Demon couldn’t be underestimated. In addition, the Rhinoceros Demon’s thick hide and strong defensive ability made this battle quite difficult.</p><p>And Qin Sang used it to study the sword talisman, intentionally to fight with the Rhinoceros Demon, consuming a whole day until the Rhinoceros Demon gained numerous injuries and was exhausted. At this point, Qin Sang gave it a fatal blow. Qin Sang also consumed numerous spirit stones and spirit pills for this.</p><p>After the battle, Qin Sang was contemplating a realization and his understanding of the killing talisman was deeper. He could feel that the obstacles ahead of him were as thin as a film, and could be broken with the slightest poke, indicating that this path was feasible.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew that the first killing talisman was nothing but a prelude to the whole cultivation technique, to guide those cultivating it into choosing the correct path for themselves. This was the only reason why it was so easy to understand. It was definitely not going to be so simple in the future.</p><p>The light beam swiftly flew through the air and Qin Sang’s destination was in the direction of the python demon’s cave.</p><p>Qin Sang confined the Rhinoceros Demon’s corpse by blood restriction and didn’t separate it to collect the spirits, because he was planning to use the Rhinoceros Demon as bait to lure out the python demon.</p><p>For demonic beasts, the corpse of a demon灵is a great supplement, especially fresh corpses with ample blood, which is an absolute temptation to them.</p><p>A few days later, Qin Sang’s figure quietly appeared on a dangerous peak.</p><p>The dangerous peak emerged from the water like it was carved by a blade and axe, making it extremely steep. Qin Sang flitted around until he appeared in a huge cave on the dangerous peak. This was where Senior Brother Wang found the python’s cast-off skin.</p><p>There was a lingering putrid smell that was not dispersing in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, and set up the Samsara Trapping Formation in front of the cave. Then, he took out some of the demon’s blood from the Rhinoceros Demon’s corpse, scattered half into the water, and then continued to scatter the blood intermittently all the way into the cave. Finally, he placed the Rhinoceros Demon’s corpse on the spot, and only used a simple water barrier to block the cave entrance. The aura of the big demon immediately dispersed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang slipped into the darkness and silently waited.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Waves of water suddenly splashed from the bottom of the dangerous peak, and a huge wave was created from thin air, hitting the dangerous peak. Then, the water’s surface calmed again, and a long white shadow could be vaguely seen flashing by, disappearing into the water.</p><p>After the Rhinoceros Demon’s aura dispersed, it took the python demon half a day to show up. This demon was extremely cautious, and didn’t barge into the cave directly. It only stirred up some trouble once every one or two hours, kicking up some waves.</p><p>“This python demon is really not simple-minded.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive and said in his heart.</p>
