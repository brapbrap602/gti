<h1>Chapter 867: Star Sha</h1><p>Young Master Fang crashed into the forest, snapping a large swathe of ancient trees.  A muffled groan echoed from the debris, and he staggered to his feet, covered in leaves and dirt, looking quite disheveled.  He shook his head, still dazed and disoriented.</p><p>A moment later, he snapped awake, looked at his hand, and saw that the protective talisman his master had given him was shattered, its power spent. He had sensed danger early on, made a timely escape, but was still caught in the blast.  He survived only thanks to his master's talisman.</p><p>“Was that the Hidden Fight Sect's secret technique, the Lightning Manipulation Art?”</p><p>He muttered to himself, his face etched with shock as he looked towards the center of the battlefield.</p><p>Lightning crackled.</p><p>He couldn't see clearly through the electric discharge, but Young Master Fang knew that the five cultivators he had hired were likely dead.</p><p>He was immensely relieved that he had been cautious enough not to lead the charge into the enemy's lair. He'd recruited those five as cannon fodder instead. Otherwise, he would be lying dead among them.</p><p>Just as he was about to retreat, his body swayed, and another wave of dizziness washed over him.</p><p>“What's this?”</p><p>Alarmed, he hastily inspected his internal state and was shocked to discover a strange, unfamiliar energy within him.  It was incredibly cold, sinister, and chaotic, like a type of sha energy he had never encountered before.</p><p>This energy was invading his elixir field and assaulting his nascent soul, causing instability and making it difficult to control his true essence.</p><p>"It appeared with the lightning and entered my body without me noticing? What kind of power is this?!  The Lightning Manipulation Art is the most powerful technique I've ever seen. It's been shelved as a forbidden art by the Hidden Fight Sect!  And the Bull Peak lineage, who practiced this art, was expelled and disowned by the sect…”</p><p>He quickly sat down to expel the dark energy when he suddenly heard his Fourth Junior Brother's furious shout.</p><p>“Golden Radiance Armor! You killed Little Junior Brother!"</p><p>Young Master Fang froze, the decades-old tragedy of his master's beloved Little Junior Brother's death in the Demon Sea flashing back.  The killer remained at large, and as the eldest disciple, he had suffered severe punishment from his master for failing to protect his younger brother.</p><p>He had searched high and low for the culprit, and now, by sheer coincidence, he was here!</p><p>The killer was among these five!</p><p>He had hired them as pawns, but unexpectedly found the murderer of his Little Junior Brother.  What a pleasant surprise!</p><p>Perhaps it was the Golden Radiance Armor that had saved the killer's life.  It was a treasure bestowed by their master upon Little Junior Brother, and Young Master Fang knew its power well.</p><p>“He killed Little Junior Brother and is even wearing his inner armor…”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Young Master Fang's eyes, but the sha energy hampered him, preventing him from moving immediately.</p><p>…</p><p>Ma De Bao swung the Heaven-Shaking Five-Section Whip like a snapping shrimp, using the momentum to leap back repeatedly.  But his luck didn't last. Like Young Master Fang, he was suddenly struck by dizziness.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Clutching his head, his body stiffened, his true essence fluctuated wildly, and the whip trembled in his grip.</p><p>When he discovered the unknown energy, he tried to expel it, but the kuilong, having killed the other three, had caught up to him.</p><p>Terror filled his face. The energy disrupted his protective true essence, rendering him unable to control his magic weapon and offer effective resistance. The kuilong swatted away his whip with its tail and then engulfed him in a ball of lightning, ending his life.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang, fleeing the desolate island, also felt something amiss within him.</p><p>Looking inward, he saw the Sky-Eye Butterfly fluttering erratically in his qi sea as if drunk.</p><p>He was puzzled, wondering why the butterfly was behaving this way.</p><p>Was the lightning poisonous?</p><p>His divine sense swept outwards, detecting the anomaly, but surprisingly, it felt familiar.</p><p>“Star Sha?”</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the nature of this energy. It was remarkably similar to the star sha energy he had attracted while cultivating the "Celestial Demon Body Tempering" technique, sharing the same sinister and chaotic aura.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly had been affected by this energy.</p><p>However, during cultivation, the attracted star sha was always blocked by the Jade Buddha and then slowly refined and expelled by Qin Sang. It couldn't possibly remain. This star sha must have entered with the lightning.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly had devoured the lightning and ingested the star sha along with it.</p><p>Utterly yang lightning energy and sinister, chaotic star sha, two diametrically opposed forces. How could they be merged together?</p><p>Time didn't allow for contemplation. Qin Sang quickly helped the Sky-Eye Butterfly expel the star sha.</p><p>He was experienced in dealing with star sha, and the Sky-Eye Butterfly had only consumed a small amount of lightning, so the impact was minimal. He easily stabilized its nascent soul.</p><p>Then he heard an angry shout from ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw a black-robed figure with a strange flag in hand rising from the churning waves. The figure glared at him with fury.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang spotted other figures in different directions, all similarly dressed black-robed figures, holding identical strange flags, their energies interconnected.</p><p>"Golden Radiance Armor? Little Junior Brother?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled the past incident.</p><p>During the Shaman Uprising, he was tracked and ambushed by shamans in the Demon Sea. After killing them, he immediately fled.  Later, Ran Luo told him that the shamans had quite a background, being direct disciples of the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch.</p><p>Old Zou and Ran Luo used the Merchant Guild's influence to cover for him, preventing further trouble.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they met again in the Inner Sea, and his identity was exposed by the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>“They are Black Serpent Mountain disciples, shamans!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>This was the heartland of the human race.  Most shamans operated in the southeastern seas near the Shaman God Continent.  Why were they here?</p><p>Seeing them wielding flags in formation, clearly prepared, they couldn't have just been passing by.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that there must be a traitor among his monster-hunting companions, most likely the organizer, Young Master Fang.</p><p>This man was a shaman spy, or perhaps a shaman himself!</p><p>The world of cultivation was filled with countless wondrous treasures.  It wasn't unusual for items to exist that could conceal one's identity and evade the Sky-Eye Butterfly's detection.</p><p>Coupled with the mysterious group who could wield strange lightning techniques, Qin Sang felt the shadow of a vast conspiracy looming over him, his mind awash with questions.</p><p>The black-robed figure blocked his path, transmitted a message to their fellow disciples, then turned and waved the strange flag to attack Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing danger, Qin Sang quickly dismissed his thoughts.  Without pausing, he flickered and charged towards the blocking figure.</p><p>He finally got a clear look at the strange flags.</p><p>The dark fabric seemed to seal the nascent souls of various monstrous beasts. These souls were unruly, violent, and bloodthirsty, and the flags themselves radiated a strong, ominous aura, clearly not benevolent tools.</p><p>The eighty-one Beast King Banners were clearly a set, their combined power surely no less than the Frostwind Gale Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that if he were trapped, he would be doomed.</p>
