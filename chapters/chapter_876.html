<h1>Chapter 868: The Struggle</h1><p>Chapter 868: The Struggle</p><p>But he keenly sensed something was amiss, realizing he wasn't without a chance.</p><p>The opponents hadn't initially targeted him; their aim was the mysterious individuals wielding thunder magic.  A black-robed man, upon discovering his identity, abruptly shifted their target, intending to eliminate him first.</p><p>Thus, their formation was unsteady, and others couldn't provide immediate support.</p><p>In fact, as Qin Sang suspected, the black-robed man had accidentally discovered the killer of his junior brother and decided to take revenge.</p><p>They considered Qin Sang, after having expended significant energy deploying the Heavenly Cold Gale Formation to hunt demons and then enduring a lightning strike, to be gravely wounded and exhausted—an easy target for the fourth brother.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang, the recently weakened disciples of the Lan Dou Sect were far more important, crucial to the mission's success.</p><p>Losing this opportunity by prioritizing one person over securing the Lan Dou Sect disciples would be disastrous.  Therefore, the others continued to pursue the Lan Dou Sect disciples, merely using the Beast King Banner to support their fourth brother.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, having dispelled the stellar煞, returned to normal and, under Qin Sang's command, activated its Sky Eye.</p><p>The black-robed man wielded a strange banner.</p><p>Beast spirits roared, leaping from the banner and charging.</p><p>A shimmering golden expanse, like a wall of gold, pressed down with immense force, accompanied by deafening roars that shook the very earth.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave, yet his eyes held a hint of mockery.</p><p>The seemingly terrifying aura of the strange banner array was completely transparent under the Sky Eye.  The incomplete formation was riddled with weaknesses, and Qin Sang easily identified a point of entry.</p><p>He didn't slow down but accelerated, colliding head-on with the beast spirits.</p><p>The fourth brother, seeing Qin Sang rush directly into the beast spirits, smiled—then his face froze.</p><p>At the moment of being engulfed in golden light...</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating this, abruptly halted, then shifted several meters, effortlessly dodging the attack and passing between the beast spirits.</p><p>Surrounded by the Beast King Banner formation, Qin Sang remained calm.</p><p>The beast spirits attacked again.</p><p>Within the golden light, countless golden threads connected to the beast spirits, sharp as blades. Entanglement meant capture; severing them, dismemberment.</p><p>But with the Sky Eye Butterfly's aid, Qin Sang not only saw the beast spirits' movements clearly but also easily identified the hidden threads.</p><p>A complete formation would have been extremely difficult, but this one posed no real threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>With a circling dragon's shadow, he darted through the golden light, covering several meters in an instant.</p><p>The pursuing beast spirits missed completely, as did the deadly golden threads. Qin Sang emerged unharmed.</p><p>The black-robed man finally sensed something was wrong.</p><p>His opponent seemed exceptionally skilled in formations, easily exploiting the weaknesses.</p><p>Enraged and surprised, the black-robed man frantically manipulated the Beast King Banner, but to no avail, watching Qin Sang approach. Even more infuriating, Qin Sang brazenly summoned his spirit sword to attack.</p><p>The ebony sword sliced through the golden light with astonishing speed.</p><p>The black-robed man's face burned with fury, still unconvinced Qin Sang could escape his grasp. He telepathically instructed his brothers to activate a more powerful variation of the formation.</p><p>The golden light intensified.</p><p>Beast spirits self-destructed, transforming into golden energy that infused the threads.  Instantly, even denser threads materialized, forming a network of nets.</p><p>The black-robed man lunged at the ebony sword, and the golden nets surged forward.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The ebony sword flashed repeatedly, shattering the nets.</p><p>Finally, one golden net ensnared the ebony sword, but the sword shattered piece by piece.</p><p>The black-robed man stared intently; it was merely a sword image.</p><p>“Sword image transformation!”</p><p>The black-robed man was stunned, then furious, continuing his search, recapturing the actual ebony sword.</p><p>Despite repeatedly missing, the countless nets within the Beast King Banner formation eventually entangled the ebony sword, no matter how nimble it was.</p><p>Just as the ebony sword was about to break free, it was ensnared, and more nets descended.</p><p>“With your treasure gone, let's see how much longer you can struggle!”</p><p>The black-robed man sneered, activating the formation to suppress the ebony sword.</p><p>Then, a sinister crimson light flashed before his eyes.  Before he could react, it struck a Beast King Banner.</p><p>The banner, not a particularly high-quality artifact, instantly lost its spiritual light upon being hit by the crimson light and shattered with a ‘crack.’</p><p>The Beast King Banner was destroyed!</p><p>The black-robed man stared dumbfounded, still struggling to comprehend what had happened.</p><p>Within the great formation, the auras of all the Beast King Banners were interconnected.  Any damage to a single banner would affect the entire formation. From Qin Sang's perspective, the formation's weaknesses were magnified.</p><p>A large section of the golden net vanished, leaving Qin Sang unimpeded. He sped towards the edge of the formation, rapidly closing the distance to the cloaked figure.</p><p>The cloaked figure frantically tried to repair the formation.  Seeing this, he realized he was running out of time and made a decisive choice: to unleash his magical treasure and fight Qin Sang.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't give him the chance.</p><p>The moment his identity was revealed, Qin Sang's mind raced, devising an escape plan.  Even without using the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, breaking the formation wouldn't be difficult, but afterwards, he would be entangled by the cloaked figure and subsequently attacked by others.</p><p>Therefore, he had to eliminate this obstacle as quickly as possible and escape. To that end, Qin Sang spared no effort, unleashing the Blood-Soiled Divine Light and, without hesitation, his rarely used Star Conch.</p><p>He heard a sharp whistling sound.</p><p>A nameless terror seized the cloaked figure.  To his horror, he saw a point of incredibly brilliant blue light in his vision. He had almost no resistance before the Star Conch pierced him.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>A large, clear hole appeared on the cloaked figure's chest, followed moments later by a torrent of blood. His body froze mid-air, his eyes wide, a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>He had used the power of the formation to kill a weakened opponent, seeking revenge for his junior brother.</p><p>His revenge unfulfilled, he had paid with his life.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The cloaked figure's corpse plunged into the sea.</p><p>The Star Conch, having taken the man's life, returned to Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang darted out of the formation, put away the Star Conch, and beckoned the corpse of the cloaked figure towards him. Upon closer inspection, he confirmed it was a member of the Witch Clan.  After taking the man's belongings, Qin Sang was about to seize the Beast King Banners he controlled when he heard angry roars in the distance.</p><p>The cloaked figure's companions had discovered what happened.</p><p>Qin Sang smirked, ignoring them.  He unleashed his true essence, enveloping the Beast King Banners and pulling them back forcefully. Unexpectedly, he met strong resistance from the banners.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang realized the others were using the connection between the Beast King Banners to contest his control.</p><p>There was no reason to relinquish the prize now in hand.</p><p>After a brief moment's thought, Qin Sang activated the Ten Directions Yama Banner, unleashing demonic flames to engulf the Beast King Banners.</p>
