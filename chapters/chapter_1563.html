<h1></h1><p>‘Whooooosh! Whooooosh!’</p><p>The icy wind howled, and a blizzard raged.</p><p>Snowflakes, large as mats, filled the sky.</p><p>Between heaven and sea, only white remained.</p><p>Centered around the Snowtreading Divine Blade, a zone of extreme cold formed. Wherever the chill reached, the sea surface rapidly froze, becoming a massive ice sheet.</p><p>These snowflakes weren't ordinary snow, but condensed blade intent, sharp beyond compare.</p><p>The Snowtreading Divine Blade tore through the air, appearing where the Sea Patrol Yaksha had vanished. Its tip pointed obliquely downwards, towards the seabed, as blade intent poured forth.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Countless snowflakes pierced the ice sheet.</p><p>The ice sheet became riddled with holes, yet the chill intensified, spreading rapidly downwards and outwards. At this rate, a vast expanse of the sea would freeze over.</p><p>Beneath the surface.</p><p>Riding a Blue Jiao, the Sea Patrol Yaksha fled through the water, moving with exceptional agility, unimpeded.</p><p>Sensing the change in energy above, the Sea Patrol Yaksha raised its head, seeing only a vast expanse of white, as if the heavens were collapsing. A fierce glint flashed in its eyes.</p><p>The Sea Patrol Yaksha’s aura merged with the Blue Jiao beneath it, pushing their speed to the limit. Its legs clamped tightly around the Blue Jiao, which revealed an expression of pain, unable to control its own body.</p><p>At the same time, the Sea Patrol Yaksha's expression stiffened slightly, then regained its fluidity.</p><p>The Snowtreading Divine Blade hummed.</p><p>Its blade vibrated violently, shooting out a myriad of blade lights. A white streak traversed the sky, like a rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>Though it was midday, the sun's light seemed to grow cold.</p><p>Zhou Jin and the others, piloting their flying treasures, sensed something and turned their heads. Witnessing this astonishing scene, their faces were filled with awe.</p><p>The divine blade descended!</p><p>The ice sheet shattered with a boom. Countless ice fragments, swept up by the Snowtreading Divine Blade, tore through the sea, leaving a gigantic trench in its wake.</p><p>The surrounding seawater couldn't close in time. Instead, it was struck by the storm of ice fragments, forming mountainous waves on both sides. Reaching their peak, they froze, transforming into two icy mountains.</p><p>The ice mountains undulated like dragons.</p><p>Between the ice mountains, the trench appeared bottomless, highlighting the astonishing power of the single strike.</p><p>Within the trench, the figures of the Sea Patrol Yaksha and the Blue Jiao were exposed.</p><p>Before the divine blade arrived, the frigid blade intent had already enveloped them, sealing the surrounding void as ice spread over their bodies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sea Patrol Yaksha made no attempt to retaliate, allowing itself to be encased in ice.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an ice sculpture formed.</p><p>The Sea Patrol Yaksha's expression suddenly became rigid, then its figure vanished into thin air – it was an illusion. Only the Blue Jiao was truly frozen.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered above, looking down. Seeing this, his expression remained unchanged. He shifted his hand seals, reversing the Snowtreading Divine Blade. It bypassed the Blue Jiao, slashing towards the depths of the trench.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A roar erupted from the trench.</p><p>The roar echoed between the icy walls, spiraling and intensifying. By the time it reached the surface, it was earth-shattering. Zhou Jin and the others heard it clearly, their hearts filled with dread.</p><p>The roar originated from a Blue Jiao.</p><p>This Blue Jiao appeared identical to others, but its size was immense, fifteen times larger than the frozen one, comparable to a whale.</p><p>The gigantic Blue Jiao half-rolled its body, glaring upwards at Qin Sang. With a flick of its massive tail, its scales parted. Relying on its formidable physique and brute force, it slammed into the Snowtreading Divine Blade.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The resulting shockwave shattered the icy walls, allowing seawater to rush in.</p><p>Initially impeded, the Snowtreading Divine Blade eventually pierced the Blue Jiao's scales, cleaving its skull.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flashed, appearing above. He glanced around, muttering with some regret, "What a clever use of illusion and Water Escape! It's a pity I didn't bring the Heaven's Eye Butterfly."</p><p>As his voice faded, the Blue Jiao’s remains lost their spiritual light, dissolving into two pools of seawater.</p><p>The Sea Patrol Yaksha had vanished without a trace.</p><p>The sea was its domain.</p><p>The Sea Patrol Yaksha was extremely cautious, maintaining a distance from the battle. Sensing danger, it had fled immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang also had to be wary of potential ambushes. Even if he had used the Four Serpent Seal directly, he likely wouldn't have gained anything.</p><p>He extended his spiritual sense, but couldn't detect the Sea Patrol Yaksha's aura. He could only retrieve the Snowtreading Divine Blade, flashing out of the trench to find the ice sculpture tossed out by the shockwave.</p><p>He had deliberately controlled his strength, and this Blue Jiao was still alive. It floated on the sea surface, belly up. Its eyes darted around as it struggled violently, but it couldn't break free from its icy prison. Seeing Qin Sang approach, its expression was filled with terror.</p><p>"I know you possess sentience!"</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the ice. "I ask, you answer!"</p><p>The Blue Jiao nodded frantically, its head bumping against the ice prison.</p><p>"Are you a group of demon cultivators who have always cultivated here, or did you migrate from elsewhere? Where is your lair? Why did you come here? How many other Demon Kings are nearby?" Qin Sang stared intently into the Blue Jiao's eyes.</p><p>The Blue Jiao dared not hesitate. It opened its maw, revealing rows of fangs, yet its voice was as thin as a mosquito's, timid and trembling. "Reporting to Master, this humble demon has always cultivated in the deep sea with my King, never harming humans. Not long ago, my King suddenly led an army here, attacking the treasure ship under his orders. Please, Master, understand. This humble demon has always been a mount, with little knowledge. I don't know my King's intentions, but I heard him say that other Kings will be coming soon…"</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled with amusement, ignoring the Blue Jiao's fawning gaze, lost in thought.</p><p>He then asked a few more questions. The Blue Jiao answered everything it knew, but couldn't provide the information Qin Sang sought.</p><p>The Sea Patrol Yaksha had indeed arrived recently.</p><p>Demon Kings were converging on the Red South Archipelago. Could there truly be a secret here, one that even the demon race had caught wind of?</p><p>This place was not suitable for a long stay!</p><p>Qin Sang exerted a slight force with his foot, shattering the ice.</p><p>The Blue Jiao regained its freedom, but dared not leave without orders. It trembled, staying close to Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the Blue Jiao's back, pointing towards the Red South Archipelago. "Let's go!"</p><p>The Blue Jiao didn't dare utter a sound, parting the water as it swam. Before long, it caught up with Zhou Jin and the others. With Qin Sang's permission, they too mounted the Blue Jiao for their return.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained silent, and the others didn't dare speak.</p><p>In this silence, they encountered no beast hordes, smoothly returning to the Red South Archipelago.</p><p>"Disperse."</p><p>Stepping onto land, Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Leng Qi and the others finally had the chance to express their gratitude, bowing to Qin Sang before departing with various thoughts in their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head, seeing the Blue Jiao peeking its head onto the shore, staring expectantly at him.</p><p>He casually picked up a handful of earth, shaping it into a clay bowl. He then conjured a bowl of water and said to the Blue Jiao, "Come in."</p><p>The Blue Jiao was dumbfounded, staring blankly at the crude bowl. It was extremely reluctant, but didn't dare defy him, obediently shrinking its size.</p><p>In the palm-sized clay bowl, the Blue Jiao swam like a small fry.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the bowl to Zhou Jin. "Take it back to the inn and keep it in the pond in the backyard."</p><p>Zhou Jin didn't dare treat it as casually as Qin Sang. This Blue Jiao was stronger than him. He hurriedly stretched out his hands, holding the bowl carefully, afraid of spilling it, following closely behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely back to the inn, closing the doors behind him.</p><p>The very day they landed, news of the great demon's appearance spread like a storm throughout the Red South Archipelago. Coupled with the thunder and torrential rain, it caused widespread panic.</p><p>As night fell.</p><p>The wind and rain raged.</p><p>A figure appeared before the small courtyard Qin Sang had rented.</p><p>The restrictive formation was triggered.</p><p>Inside, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, surprised. "Faster than expected!"</p><p>"Open the courtyard gates and welcome our esteemed guest!"</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice to Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu.</p><p>The couple, who were by the pond watching the Blue Jiao, exchanged glances, surprised. To their senses, there was no one outside the courtyard.</p><p>They hurriedly deactivated the formation and opened the gates, seeing an elderly man standing outside. Their expressions turned solemn, and they respectfully said, "Senior, please enter."</p><p>The elderly man wore simple, coarse linen clothes, yet his demeanor was extraordinary.</p><p>He nodded slightly, following Zhou Jin to the main hall. He paused briefly, stroking his long beard as he looked Ruan Yu up and down, who stood by the door.</p><p>Under the elderly man's gaze, Ruan Yu's face flushed slightly, her heart filled with apprehension.</p><p>Zhou Jin felt a surge of anger, yet he dared not speak.</p><p>"Excellent! Exceptional talent, a pity about the previous damage to your vital essence. Otherwise, your chances of forming a Gold Core would be high. I have a Dawn Origin Pill here that should be beneficial to you, young lady."</p><p>The elderly man produced a jade bottle containing a pill.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu were stunned.</p><p>Ruan Yu's face was flushed with embarrassment, unsure how to respond, much less accept the gift.</p><p>"Ruan Yu, thank the senior for his kindness!"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice came from within.</p><p>Ruan Yu's face lit up with joy. She accepted the jade bottle, curtseying deeply. "Thank you, Senior, for the pill."</p><p>"This old man's surname is Leng."</p><p>The elderly man smiled warmly, turning to enter the main hall. He announced in a clear voice, "Leng You, Left Protector of the Gu God Sect, pays a visit. I hope my untimely arrival hasn't disturbed Fellow Daoist Qin's cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his meditation chamber. "Fellow Daoist Leng arrives bearing such a generous gift; this humble daoist is beyond grateful."</p><p>Gesturing, Qin Sang invited the elderly man to sit, asking curiously, "Are the three Leng brothers…?"</p><p>Elder Leng nodded. "Indeed, those three are my不成器的 disciples. I apologize for their earlier lack of decorum, Fellow Daoist Qin.  You saved their lives from those demonic beasts, and compared to such a life-saving grace, a mere Dawn Origin Pill is nothing."</p><p>Qin Sang understood, smiling. "So, Fellow Daoist came at your disciples' request? You're remarkably swift!"</p><p>His tone carried a hint of mockery.</p><p>Qin Sang had keenly noticed something. Elder Leng must have been near the Red South Archipelago all along. Whether he was engaged in other matters or intentionally lying in wait, only heaven knew.</p><p>The disappearance of a Nascent Soul cultivator was both significant and insignificant to most sects.</p><p>The ancient immortal sect ruins were still the stuff of legend.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were all busy cultivating and preparing for their tribulations. Sending a few favored disciples to the East Sea to investigate was already a sign of great importance. They would likely wait for concrete clues before personally getting involved.</p><p>If not for the search for the two immortal halls, Qin Sang wouldn't be personally handling this, especially with a mere avatar.</p><p>The Demon King.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator lurking in the shadows.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a premonition of an impending storm. He was at the center of the vortex, unsure whether it was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Elder Leng seemed oblivious to the mockery in Qin Sang's tone, his smile unwavering. "Hearing Leng Qi describe your astonishing divine abilities, Fellow Daoist, I feel ashamed of my own inferiority. I am truly filled with admiration. I usually pride myself on being well-informed, yet I was unaware of such a powerful cultivator as yourself! Shameful! Shameful!"</p><p>"Your disciple must have exaggerated quite a bit."</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive. "Besides, the world is vast, and heroes are plentiful. How could one know them all? Fellow Daoist, please don't take offense. This humble daoist had never heard of the Gu God Sect either."</p><p>Hearing Elder Leng claim to be from the Gu God Sect, Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling the various sects in his memory.</p><p>To familiarize himself with the cultivation world of the Central Continent, he had specifically gathered such information, yet the Gu God Sect wasn't among them.</p><p>Elder Leng was a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, yet merely a Protector within the Gu God Sect. It seemed there were other Protectors and an even higher-ranking Sect Master.</p><p>How could such a sect be unknown?</p><p>A mysterious sect hidden in the shadows, or one that only emerged after the Nascent Soul cultivator's disappearance?</p><p>The name ‘Gu God Sect’ further aroused Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>He recalled the divine abilities the three Leng brothers had displayed when they encountered the beast horde.</p><p>After the treasure ship was destroyed, the three had joined forces, opening pouches on their bodies and scattering clouds of brightly colored powders and liquids, all highly toxic substances.</p><p>The colors were chaotic, yet they followed a specific pattern.</p><p>A multicolored domain of poison formed around them. As demonic beasts approached, some died convulsing, others dissolved into puddles of pus. Even the strongest physiques couldn't withstand it; it was incredibly vicious.</p><p>Leng Qi, in particular, excelled in poison attacks. Opening his mouth, a purple scaled snake head emerged from his throat, spewing toxic fumes that merged with the poisonous domain, amplifying its power.</p><p>Witnessing this, the others were wary of the three Leng brothers, maintaining their distance.</p><p>“This ‘Gu’ is not that ‘Gu’… it’s the art of Gu poison! That snake is not a spirit insect, but a demonic venomous snake, cultivated into a Gu beast. It’s not the insect Gu of the Witch Tribe; it doesn’t seem related to them at all…”</p><p>Qin Sang had a good guess about the three Leng brothers' background.</p><p>He wondered what divine abilities this old poison master possessed.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was undoubtedly their nemesis.</p><p>His avatar, with its Spiritwood body, wasn't afraid of ordinary poisons, but there were many toxins that could harm the Nascent Soul, disrupting or even stagnating True Essence. He had to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Elder Leng didn't take offense, smiling warmly. "We haven't met before; it simply wasn't fate."</p><p>With that, Elder Leng produced a token, offering it to Qin Sang.</p><p>The token was made of dark iron. The front was engraved with the characters ‘Gu God,’ while the back depicted a uniquely shaped crown.</p><p>In the design, five jade pieces of different colors were embedded around the crown's edge, their meaning unclear.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this, Fellow Daoist?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"I have only given out two Gu God Tokens, both to fellow daoists with whom I share a connection. Although we've only just met, I recognize your chivalrous spirit, and I'm grateful for your rescue of my disciples. I hold you in high esteem. Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, the Gu God Token carries no obligations, only representing a distinguished status. You will hear of our sect often in the future. Should you encounter any trouble, our sect will offer its full support!"</p><p>Elder Leng said confidently.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally didn't believe there was such a thing as a free lunch. Since there were no obligations, he decided to accept the Gu God Token and see what this Gu God Sect was all about.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang accept the token, Elder Leng's smile became even warmer.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Elder Leng finally revealed his purpose, inquiring about Qin Sang's findings while pursuing the Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and didn't conceal anything. He instructed Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu to take Elder Leng to the backyard pond to personally question the Blue Jiao.</p>
