<h1>Chapter 1564: The Fat Silkworm's Transformation</h1><p>Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>The avatar returned, entered the cave dwelling, and sat cross-legged before the original body.</p><p>Soon after.</p><p>The original body circulated its cultivation technique through a complete cycle, awakening from its meditative state. The Nascent Soul of the second avatar flew out from the crown of the avatar's head, flashing back into the original body for nourishment.</p><p>The original body already knew everything the avatar had experienced.</p><p>Various sights and experiences flashed through its mind like a fleeting show.</p><p>"Southern Sea Immortal Palace, Gu God Sect…"</p><p>This was the information Qin Sang cared about most, at least a clue.</p><p>He didn't plan to return to the Southern Barbarian regions and contact the Gu God Sect now.</p><p>The Gu God Sect lurked in the shadows, restless, clearly not aligned with the Buddhist and Daoist factions in the open. Contacting them now could easily lead to unforeseen turmoil, caught in the middle with no way out.</p><p>As long as the Gu God Sect had ulterior motives, they would eventually reveal themselves.</p><p>His purpose in seeking the Immortal Palace was for cultivation techniques, not for treasures everyone fought over. As long as the Immortal Palace still existed, there was no rush. It was better to wait and see how the world unfolded before making a move.</p><p>Before that, it was better to focus entirely on cultivation and strive for a breakthrough as soon as possible.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang beckoned with his hand, drawing the block of ice from the avatar's hand into his palm. The Five-Colored Venomous Spider was sealed within the ice, still alive, its life force remarkably tenacious.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Qin Sang cracked open the ice.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider curled its eight legs, hugging itself into a ball.  Feeling the restraints disappear, its eight legs twitched slightly. It abruptly turned, all eight legs dancing, about to flee.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider and its venom net froze in place. It then found itself surrounded by several invisible walls, trapped in a confined space, unable to see anything, letting out anxious hisses.</p><p>Qin Sang cast an invisible cage, his eyes slightly closed. He carefully sensed for a moment, murmuring to himself, "It doesn't seem like a naturally born spirit insect. The venom it sprays seems like a fusion of various toxins, with a sense of disharmony, and its nature is extremely vicious. I've heard that there's a method in the cultivation world for breeding evil insects: devouring other spirit insects, or placing several specific spirit insects together, letting them fight amongst themselves, and selecting the most ferocious evil insect, calling it a Gu. This is distinctly different from the Witch Tribe's natal Gu techniques… Could this be artificially bred?"</p><p>Having raised so many spirit insects, Qin Sang had heard of various insect control techniques.</p><p>The Witch Tribe's natal Gu wasn't suitable for this kind of enhancement.</p><p>Natal Gu already carried the risk of backlash. A 'Gu' cultivated this way, with its extremely violent nature, would only exacerbate the risk. If used as a natal Gu, it would likely turn on its master immediately.</p><p>Furthermore, natal Gu were bound to the cultivator's life force and couldn't be taken by others.</p><p>This Five-Colored Spider's connection to its master wasn't so intimate. The mark the grey-robed man left within it had been erased by Qin Sang, severing any connection.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then summoned the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, still drowsy and not fully awake, was pinched by the scruff of its neck by Qin Sang and tossed in front of the Five-Colored Venomous Spider.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider, scurrying around like a headless fly, suddenly saw an uninvited guest. It instantly became wary, its whole body tense, staring intently at the Fat Silkworm, warning it with sharp cries.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm barely lifted its eyelids, glanced at the Five-Colored Venomous Spider, and stretched.</p><p>Enraged by its attitude, the Five-Colored Venomous Spider swelled its abdomen, aiming its rear at the Fat Silkworm, brewing a ball of multicolored venom, vibrant yet dangerous.</p><p>The venom didn't shoot out from the Five-Colored Venomous Spider. Instead, it faded and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, a transparent spider web appeared around the Fat Silkworm, quickly transforming into a multicolored venom net. With a *bang*, it spread open, falling towards the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Danger approached.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's eyelids twitched, the laziness in its eyes disappearing, replaced by a look of interest. Then it let out an excited cry.</p><p>*Slap!*</p><p>The edge of the spider web stuck to the Fat Silkworm, then immediately tightened, constricting the Fat Silkworm's body, creating a bulge of fat flesh where they touched.</p><p>Venom tried to seep in through the constriction.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm snorted disdainfully, opened its mouth, and exhaled the venom-repelling halo familiar to Qin Sang, but denser than anything Qin Sang had seen before.</p><p>Within the halo, the outline of a round bead even began to condense.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft gasp. He had thought the Fat Silkworm was still useless after its advancement, but it seemed there were changes after all!</p><p>The halo expanded, touching the venomous spider's silk. The bead within suddenly erupted with a suction force, instantly absorbing all the spider silk.</p><p>Only a single strand remained of the entire web, forcibly revealed, connected to the Five-Colored Venomous Spider's rear.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider, with its pitiful intelligence, couldn't understand what was happening.  It wore an incredulous look, desperately swelling its abdomen, shooting out more venom.</p><p>However, no matter how much venom there was, the Fat Silkworm devoured it all, becoming more energetic with each mouthful, wiggling its head and tail, looking smug.</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider began to fear, its cries filled with panic. Its entire body glowed with a glaze-like sheen as it melted into a puddle of liquid.</p><p>This sight was exactly what Qin Sang had seen before, signifying the Five-Colored Venomous Spider's attempt to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Intending to test the Fat Silkworm's abilities, he removed the cage surrounding the Five-Colored Venomous Spider.</p><p>In the void, the transparent silk threads were clearly visible to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  The venom rolled along an invisible silk thread, fleeing from the Fat Silkworm's clutches.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's reaction surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>The venom-repelling halo suddenly intensified, appearing ahead of where the Five-Colored Venomous Spider materialized. Before the spider could revert to its original form, it was swallowed whole by the venom-repelling halo.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, not stopping the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>After being swallowed, the Five-Colored Spider vanished. The venom-repelling halo flickered, the bead within pulsating as if digesting its new meal, gradually calming down.</p><p>Finally, only a complete spider husk was spat out, its abdomen shriveled.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm opened its mouth wide, swallowed the venom-repelling halo, and let out a satisfied burp.</p><p>Qin Sang had observed the entire fight between the two spirit insects, looking at the Fat Silkworm with new eyes.</p><p>Before this, the Fat Silkworm had consumed many things, such as demon cores, Amethyst, poisonous algae seeds, frogfish venom sacs, and so on, but none were pure venom, and they required a long time to digest.</p><p>Clearly, the Fat Silkworm hadn't been able to directly absorb toxins before.</p><p>In this fight with the Five-Colored Venomous Spider, it had directly drained its opponent dry. This ability to directly devour venom was definitely a new skill learned after the Fat Silkworm's transformation.</p><p>Whether the Fat Silkworm would gain significant benefits after devouring the Five-Colored Venomous Spider remained to be seen.</p><p>Looking the Fat Silkworm up and down, Qin Sang thought to himself that he needed to re-evaluate this creature.</p><p>Was this ability simply learned through transformation? Qin Sang's eyes flickered, glancing at the spider's corpse, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>He thought of three possibilities.</p><p>The first was naturally the Fat Silkworm's own bloodline, with all of its kind possessing this ability after the fourth transformation.</p><p>The second, a special possibility, was related to the Five-Colored Venomous Spider.</p><p>The Five-Colored Venomous Spider was an artificially bred evil insect.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had encountered such an evil insect. Perhaps it possessed special qualities that happened to be countered by the Fat Silkworm, making it the silkworm's preferred food.</p><p>The third possibility was something Qin Sang connected to another incident.</p><p>When they first arrived in the Middle Continent, they encountered a swarm of Decaying Phosphorus Fireflies in the Northern Wasteland's Sky Rift Valley. The Fat Silkworm made a deal with the Insect King, obtaining an Amber Insect Crystal.</p><p>He vividly remembered the scene that day.</p><p>Wherever the Decaying Phosphorus Fireflies passed, all life was drained, leaving behind desolation.</p><p>After refining the Amber Insect Crystal, could the Fat Silkworm have also gained the ability to 'devour,' merging it with its own innate abilities to comprehend a new divine power?</p><p>After much thought, Qin Sang felt the third possibility was the most likely, as it had a precedent.</p><p>However, spirit insect transformations were inherently illogical. Human understanding was merely superficial. Unless one possessed a large number of samples, it was difficult to draw accurate conclusions.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, regardless of Qin Sang's thoughts, wanted to sleep after eating its fill, turning its head and disappearing into Ya Gu's brow.</p><p>"This fellow is getting lazier and lazier."</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's growth was a cause for joy, but not enough to make him ecstatic. After all, it was still limited to the Dao of Poison, a narrow scope.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and entered meditation once more.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul nourished itself within the original body for several days. Xie An reported that someone from Unburden Mountain had arrived.</p><p>Lu Zhang had sent treasures!</p><p>The Nascent Soul returned, the avatar rose and walked out of the cave dwelling. The visitor was a youthful-looking Daoist, but a Nascent Soul Initial Stage cultivator.</p><p>The other party bowed respectfully, "Fu Han greets Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>"Is Fellow Daoist Fu that talented disciple of Sect Master Situ?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of this person.</p><p>The current Sect Master of Unburden Mountain was named Situ Yu.  Fu Han was his favored disciple, said to be the true genius of Unburden Mountain's younger generation, the undisputed choice for the next Sect Master.</p><p>Fu Han modestly replied, then followed Qin Sang into the main hall. Without sitting, he took out two jade boxes and opened them one by one. "Master and Martial Uncle Lu originally wanted to come personally to express their gratitude. Due to some inconveniences, they tasked me with delivering these two treasures… Please don't take offense, Daoist."</p><p>Seeing Fu Han's slightly hurried demeanor, Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony. He looked at the jade boxes, seeing a white crystal stone inside one of them.</p><p>Its texture was like cold jade, emitting wisps of white air, sealed by the jade box's restrictions. It was a Cold Crystal.</p><p>The other jade box contained a medicinal pill.</p><p>Qin Sang unceremoniously accepted the Cold Crystal but didn't touch the pill. "Fellow Daoist Lu is a man of his word. However, I had an agreement with him beforehand. One Cold Crystal is sufficient."</p><p>Fu Han shook his head repeatedly, "I'm merely a messenger. Martial Uncle Lu entrusted me to convey his gratitude for your assistance, Daoist. You must accept this Preserving Truth Pill, otherwise I won't be able to face Martial Uncle Lu upon returning to the mountain."</p><p>In times of crisis, a Preserving Truth Pill could save a life.</p><p>He hadn't expected Lu Zhang to be so generous.</p><p>After some back and forth, Qin Sang accepted the Preserving Truth Pill.</p><p>Fu Han sighed in relief and immediately prepared to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't persuade him to stay.</p><p>Fu Han explained, "To be honest with you, Daoist, the Contemplation Bell is extremely important to Martial Uncle Lu.  He must re-refine this treasure for his cultivation to advance further. To assist Martial Uncle Lu, Master and another Martial Uncle are also in secluded cultivation with him. Sect affairs are numerous, and we juniors must share the burden for our elders. We've already sent people to discreetly investigate that strange-faced man. Once we have news, we'll send it to Pu Mountain…"</p><p>Fu Han came and went in a hurry.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the Clear Void Illusion Realm with the two treasures.</p><p>The original body continued its secluded cultivation.</p><p>The avatar also stopped wandering, attempting to refine the Cold Crystal to aid in cultivating the *Ice Soul Divine Light*.</p><p>Firstly, because of the strange-faced man. Lu Zhang held a high position. The strange-faced man wouldn't have trouble recognizing him. By targeting Unburden Mountain, he could track Qin Sang down, posing a potential threat.</p><p>Secondly, upon returning this time, Qin Sang discovered that the original body's cultivation was nearing the peak of Nascent Soul Middle Stage, soon to begin breaking through the bottleneck to the Late Stage.</p><p>During a breakthrough, no external disturbances could be tolerated. The avatar had to remain on Pu Mountain, taking on the responsibility of protection.</p><p>Spring turned to autumn.</p><p>More than ten years passed.</p><p>Xie An and the others suddenly received orders from their ancestor. The Clear Void Illusion Realm was closed.  Without permission, no one was allowed to enter.</p><p>Within the secret realm.</p><p>The cave dwelling was also completely sealed.</p><p>The avatar sat cross-legged in a wooden building outside, protecting the original body.</p><p>By now, the original body had been in secluded cultivation in the Clear Void Illusion Realm for nearly ninety years. Finally, it had reached perfection, its cultivation reaching the peak of Nascent Soul Middle Stage, touching the bottleneck.</p><p>This breakthrough wasn't something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't say for sure how long it would take.</p><p>The only good news was that the Buddha Bone Sarira was still effective, giving him a high chance of success!</p><p>Unexpectedly, this seclusion lasted for twenty years.</p><p>During these years, many major events occurred in the Middle Continent, but they had nothing to do with Qin Sang. Even earth-shattering events couldn't disturb the original body.</p><p>In fact, the avatar had barely left the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>The Xie Family controlled Floating Ferry County, coexisting peacefully with the Six Emptiness Sect.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's restrictions, the Xie Family disciples didn't dare to be arrogant.  Xie An and the others, along with Zhou Ruan and his wife, could handle the county's affairs without disturbing Qin Sang.</p><p>Lu Zhang had also been in secluded cultivation.</p><p>Re-refining the Contemplation Bell, then refining the Stone Toad and cultivating divine powers, weren't tasks that could be completed in a short time. It was likely they wouldn't see each other for a long time.</p><p>During this period, Unburden Mountain sent messages several times, but they couldn't pinpoint the strange-faced man's whereabouts. Moreover, the opponent was a powerful cultivator, making this grudge difficult to settle.</p><p>On this day.</p><p>Xie An was demonstrating a spell to the younger generation.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt something, looked up, and saw a streak of light flying towards Pu Mountain from the horizon. It transformed into a dazzling rainbow outside the mountain, its crimson glow illuminating Pu Mountain's peak.</p><p>"Unburden Mountain's warning sword talisman!"</p><p>Xie An was stunned, his expression changing drastically. He ordered all the disciples back to their cave dwellings, then flashed into the air, catching the sword talisman before hurrying back to the mountain.</p><p>Within the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, after receiving the report, instructed Xie An to bring the sword talisman inside.</p><p>After reading the contents.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the sword talisman, murmuring, "It's getting more and more chaotic!"</p><p>He stood up and said to Xie An, who was standing beside him, "From today onwards, Pu Mountain is closed.  Xie Family disciples are not to leave the mountain lightly. Tell Zhou Jin to have Lookout Tower be careful as well."</p><p>Xie An was uneasy, asking in a low voice, "Ancestor, has something happened to Unburden Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "No one dares to provoke Unburden Mountain for now, but other places might not be so lucky. The family of a deceased elder of Unburden Mountain was attacked by unidentified individuals. They sent a message for help. The attackers came prepared, and Unburden Mountain couldn't reach them in time. Fortunately, they're not far from Floating Ferry County, so they've asked for my assistance."</p><p>"Are they Northern Wasteland devils again? They dare to infiltrate Zhuo Province!"</p><p>Xie An exclaimed.</p><p>He had heard that the northern province of Zhaoyao was in frequent turmoil.</p><p>Being closest to the Northern Wasteland, Zhaoyao Province had often been harassed by devils. These devils came and went without a trace, escaping into the Northern Wasteland after their attacks.  Their actions were brutal, often resulting in massacres.</p><p>In recent years, such incidents had become increasingly frequent, leaving everyone in Zhaoyao Province living in fear. He hadn't expected the devils to become so brazen as to extend their reach into Zhuo Province!</p>
