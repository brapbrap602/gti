<h1>Chapter 1376: Rumours</h1><p>“Hiss……”</p><p>A wave of pain shot through his meridians.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, then his expression returned to normal as he entered a meditative state.</p><p>In truth, restoring his true essence didn't have to be so troublesome.  During his crossing of the storm belt, Qin Sang had frequently consumed spirit pills and directly absorbed spiritual energy from spirit stones. The residual medicinal power and impurities accumulated in his body, unable to be refined, had damaged his meridians and dantian, affecting his true essence and causing it to become disordered.  Combined with other injuries, this had created many complications.</p><p>After a month.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, expelling a浊气 (impure breath).</p><p>He examined his inner self.</p><p>His injuries were healed, his true essence was full, and finally he felt confident enough to travel.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned his Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet's body was a natural wonder, not easily destroyed, but the puppet seals within it had been largely shattered during the great battle and required Qin Sang's personal repair.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>The Wanjian Sect members crowded into the main hall.</p><p>The hall doors were wide open, revealing the bright spring sunshine and fragrant flowers outside. No one was guarding the entrance, yet no one dared to take a step outside.</p><p>Although they didn't know that in a corner of the hall, a beautiful phoenix butterfly rested quietly.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the cave as a base, didn’t wish for a massacre, so he ordered the Tianmu butterfly to stand guard outside, keeping an eye on these people. If anyone disobeyed orders, attempted to escape, or tried to send a message, then he would act.</p><p>The hall was deathly silent.</p><p>After their initial panic, the disciples calmed down slightly.</p><p>Even so, no one could settle down to cultivate. Their eyes were vacant, and they occasionally glanced towards the cave, silently awaiting their final fate.</p><p>“Senior Sister, did that senior say when they'll leave?”</p><p>A male cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage cautiously transmitted his voice.</p><p>The female cultivator who had previously answered Qin Sang was the Sect Master's direct disciple and the eldest disciple of the Wanjian Sect. Hearing her junior brother's voice transmission, she simply shook her head gently.</p><p>The man said hoarsely, “Senior Sister, don't worry, the senior's cultivation is peerless; they wouldn't deceive us.”</p><p>His tone lacked confidence.</p><p>The female cultivator fell silent for a moment, thinking wistfully, “Fortunately, the Sect Master and my junior brother are outside. I only hope they don't return too soon. No matter what happens, at least our Wanjian Sect will not be extinguished…”</p><p>In this region, the Wanjian Sect could be considered a local hegemon.</p><p>As a disciple of the Wanjian Sect's Sect Master and a cultivator at the False Core stage, nearby cultivators had always treated her with utmost respect.</p><p>Only now did she understand how powerless she was against a true strong cultivator.</p><p>The other party could easily erase the Wanjian Sect from existence with a single finger. Even if the Yin Yue Sect got wind of this, they would most likely ignore it; they wouldn't offend a Nascent Soul cultivator for them.</p><p>They were fish on a chopping block, and could only hope that the other party was not a bloodthirsty and cruel demon.</p><p>‘Boom…’</p><p>A muffled sound came from the direction of the cave.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, a streak of light shot out from the hall.  Before anyone could see what it was, it disappeared into the sky.</p><p>Uproar erupted in the hall.</p><p>The female cultivator abruptly stood up, her expression shifting rapidly.</p><p>The others dared not move, all looking at the female cultivator.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, the female cultivator tremblingly walked towards the cave. She saw that the cave entrance was open, and inside, it was empty except for a bag of spirit stones.</p><p>The female cultivator's mind suddenly relaxed, nearly causing her to collapse to the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>“That's Fengyang Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the peak of a barren mountain, gazing at the towering peak in the distance.</p><p>Fengyang Mountain soared into the clouds, majestic and imposing.</p><p>The surrounding mountains seemed to converge on Fengyang Mountain, a truly worthy immortal mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang had rushed here non-stop after leaving the Wanjian Sect.</p><p>At the foot of Fengyang Mountain lay the largest market in the area, a good place to gather information.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye, observing Fengyang Mountain from afar. He discovered that the mountain's spirit array was fully activated, surrounded by immortal clouds and heavily guarded, indicating that something major was happening.</p><p>However, the market below seemed unremarkable, with a steady flow of people at the city gate, everything normal.</p><p>It seemed that only the important locations on the mountain were under strict guard.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang changed his appearance, wearing a Daoist robe and suppressing his cultivation to the Golden Core stage. He then used his body technique and calmly flew towards Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>The market was a city built into the mountain.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the city gate.</p><p>Sensing the aura Qin Sang projected, the crowd immediately parted.</p><p>A guard bowed and politely said, "Senior, please present your fish talisman."</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed that cultivators entering and leaving the market all carried a fishbone-shaped talisman, presumably a form of identity token.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators could enter freely, but even Golden Core cultivators were not exempt.</p><p>He shook his head. “This Daoist is a far traveler. I have long heard of Master Feng’s great name and am filled with admiration.  Having just arrived at Fengyang Mountain, I have not yet obtained a fish talisman.”</p><p>The guards didn't dare to cause trouble, producing a golden fish amulet.  "May I ask your Daoist name, senior?"</p><p>"My humble name is Mingyue."</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang entered the city, a golden fish amulet now in his hand.  He examined it briefly before storing it in his storage ring.</p><p>"Senior, please wait."</p><p>A hurried voice called from behind. A man in green robes quickly caught up.  He had been peeking around the city gate while Qin Sang spoke with the guards.  Seeing Qin Sang stop, the man in green was overjoyed, his face breaking into a wide smile.  "Senior, you must be new here. You'll surely need a guide. I'm a local, and I know every corner of this city like the back of my hand..."</p><p>He was halfway through his sentence when Qin Sang interrupted him by throwing two spirit stones.</p><p>The man in green caught the stones, bewildered.</p><p>"What are the names and locations of the largest trading houses in the market?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The man in green hesitated, then pointed towards the mountaintop. "Senior, there are three of the largest, all built in the Upper District..."</p><p>The Upper District was the most important trading area in the city.</p><p>The man in green wasn't exaggerating. He knew not only the addresses of the major trading houses but also countless rumors.</p><p>"The third one is the Fengyang Trading House, the strongest of the three.  As the name suggests, it's affiliated with Master Feng. Each trading house in the city is influential, with different focuses and connections, plus other taboos...it's hard to explain quickly.  What exactly do you need, senior? Perhaps you could hire me for a few more days..."</p><p>The man in green was speaking volubly when Qin Sang's indifferent gaze swept over him.  He was struck silent, as if paralyzed by lightning.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang's back disappeared did he seem to snap out of it, shivering, and quickly departed, clutching the spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to the Upper District. He spent a long time wandering the city, observing the local customs and gathering information.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang walked towards the Upper District, a playful glint in his eyes.</p><p>"Interesting. Master Feng is actually looking for me, inviting me to visit Fengyang Mountain.  It seems one of the two people who scared away Bi Fang that day was likely him!"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't intentionally seeking this information.</p><p>The matter was widely circulated, a topic of much discussion.</p><p>Qin Sang casually entered a few shops and heard many cultivators discussing it.</p>
