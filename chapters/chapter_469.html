<h1>Chapter 462: The Maelstrom</h1><p>A month later.</p><p>The beam of light, now dozens of times larger than its initial appearance, was thick enough for two people to embrace.  A shimmering radiance flowed within the beam, seemingly an endless influx of stellar energy pouring into the mirror.</p><p>Day and night, without cease.</p><p>The silver mirror on the water's surface was extremely conspicuous, like a large silver hole leading to another world.</p><p>A group arrived riding giant serpents, encountering Tianxing League cultivators on airships approaching from the south.</p><p>Both parties stopped near the light beam.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others hastily dismounted their serpentine mounts, offering respectful thanks.  The serpent, though the Beastmaster Shepo's pet, was a powerful Golden Core-level妖 (yao), and its relationship with the Tianyao Qiu was unclear, demanding respect.</p><p>Immediately after, the sound of wind and thunder arose from the north, as other Golden Core cultivators arrived in groups, stopping at a distance and not advancing further.</p><p>After all, their purpose wasn't conflict.  Their presence served as a precaution against the Tianxing League reneging on any agreements.</p><p>From the south, a vast, rolling dark cloud appeared, likewise halting at a distance, facing off against the Xiaohan Domain experts.</p><p>The water surrounding the beam, however, remained unusually calm.</p><p>A gentle breeze swept across their faces.</p><p>Qin Sang observed his surroundings discreetly.  Except for the two clusters of Golden Core cultivators, the area was deserted, with no sign of the Yuan Ying powerhouses from either side.</p><p>Their absence didn't mean they weren't there.  A Yuan Ying cultivator could easily hide, even from Shepo.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a twinge of anxiety, clutching the wooden carving in his chest.  There was no turning back; he could only press forward.</p><p>Leading the Tianxing League was a warrior clad in golden armor.</p><p>This individual was exceptionally tall, twice Qin Sang's height, with arms thick as water buckets. The heavy golden armor, gleaming brilliantly, seemed almost too small for him.</p><p>Whether this was a natural gift or the result of his cultivation remained unknown.</p><p>This golden-armored warrior held a position within the Tianxing League similar to Shepo's, a top-tier late Golden Core cultivator, seemingly even stronger than Shepo.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard rumors of the golden-armored warrior once facing Shepo and her beast alone, fighting evenly against two opponents, showcasing his remarkable strength.</p><p>Despite being enemies, the atmosphere wasn't tense.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Shepo and the golden-armored warrior silently communicating for a while, but he couldn't hear anything, and could only wait patiently for the opening of the Zhantian Peak.</p><p>A full hour passed.</p><p>No one showed any impatience.</p><p>Finally, the light beam changed.</p><p>The mirror surface visibly brightened, becoming increasingly dazzling, never ceasing its intensification, until it was impossible to look at directly.</p><p>Affected by the mirror, the beam also intensified, its radiant fluctuations becoming more violent.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed that this radiance was a peculiar energy, automatically converging on the beam for some reason.</p><p>Or perhaps, the radiance was being drawn to the mirror.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Suddenly, an explosive sound echoed, and the light at the mirror surface expanded abruptly.</p><p>A powerful wave surged outward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The invisible wave swept in all directions, carrying a terrifying force that caused Qin Sang and the others to change color in alarm.</p><p>The previously calm water surface was instantly subjected to a hurricane-like assault, with waves dozens of meters high crashing onto the shore.</p><p>Despite the raging storm, Qin Sang and the others remained steady.</p><p>Shepo raised her staff, from whose tip emerged a deep green protective dome that shielded Qin Sang and the others, resisting the wave’s impact.</p><p>Opposite them, the golden-armored warrior erupted with blood energy, his golden armor radiating brilliantly, forming a wall of light fused with blood energy, protecting the cultivators behind him.</p><p>For a late Golden Core cultivator, protecting them was effortless.</p><p>Free from immediate danger, Qin Sang focused intently on the mirror.</p><p>After the burst, the light from the mirror was less intense. Countless star-like fragments erupted, then silently dissipated into the void.</p><p>The mirror seemed shattered, the star fragments and radiance forming a storm, the surrounding lake water churning into a massive whirlpool.</p><p>The water in the large vortex swirled rapidly, generating a powerful suction force, even causing the protective dome created by Shepo's staff to deform slightly.</p><p>When the speed of the swirling water reached its peak, a muffled boom resonated, and an intense white light shot into the sky.</p><p>The beam of light was completely dispersed.</p><p>At the source of the blinding light, everyone could vaguely see a deep opening appear at the heart of the vortex, deep within the storm.</p><p>Just then, they suddenly heard Shepo's low shout.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Go in now?</p><p>Everyone had assumed they would wait until the storm dissipated, and the entrance to the  peak fully revealed itself before entering.  They hadn't expected to charge straight into the heart of it.</p><p>The fluctuations emanating from the storm weren't as terrifying as before, but still not to be underestimated.</p><p>Worried expressions appeared on everyone's faces, but Shepo had already put away her staff, the pull intensifying.  Dares not disobey, they all summoned their protective talismans and flew downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed was neither fast nor slow.  As he neared the storm, the green robe-like garment on his body glowed brightly, mysterious runes appearing on its back.</p><p>This garment was also a high-quality, top-tier magical artifact, possessing strong defensive capabilities.</p><p>The moment he burst into the storm, Qin Sang felt a powerful tearing force from all directions. The green light of his robe almost dissipated.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang poured all his spiritual energy into it, saving the garment from destruction.</p><p>His vision was completely obliterated by the white light; even his spiritual sense couldn't leave his body. In the chaotic storm, Qin Sang barely managed to maintain his balance, his figure plummeting.</p><p>Finally breaking free from the storm and entering the opening, before Qin Sang could celebrate, he was immediately subjected to an even stronger suction force.</p><p>This wasn't a single force, but countless forces intertwined, forming a new, more chaotic and powerful storm, far more difficult to withstand than the one outside!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what Vice-Island Master Xiao had said: disregard everything else, focus on protecting oneself, letting the storm buffet him like a lone boat adrift.</p><p>At that moment, he could still clearly feel the wooden carving hidden in his chest, secretly relieved.  Old Woman Jing hadn't exaggerated; it hadn't been discovered.</p><p>After a dizzying spin,</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the storm's power weakening slightly.</p><p>Even better news: the white light that had consumed his vision finally receded somewhat.</p><p>Aware of the dangers within the peak, Qin Sang immediately widened his eyes, doing his best to discern his bearings as the storm tossed him about.</p><p>Enduring the disorientation, he memorized everything he saw, managing to piece together a complete view.</p><p>Besides himself, there was no one else around.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong had been lucky enough to stay close, but they were separated by the storm the moment they entered the opening.</p>
