<h1>Chapter 1745: Blood Rainbow Pierces the Heavens, Crimson Star Falls Beyond</h1><p>North Sea.</p><p>Green Sheep Island.</p><p>Li Yufu sat in meditation on his jade couch, seemingly sensing something. He slightly opened his eyes, though he made no movement. Just then, the sound of golden bells echoed from outside the hall, and a middle-aged Taoist hurried in. From his demeanor, it was clear he held a high position. This man was none other than the current head of the Green Sheep Temple, known by his Dharma name, Zhizhen.</p><p>Entering the hall, Zhizhen approached with a respectful expression, knelt, and said, "Reporting to the Patriarch, I have just received a message from Palace Master Tong of the Profound Heaven Palace."</p><p>Li Yufu let out a soft "Oh." He was aware of the recent instability in the sea. "Has the Demon Island made another move? Since the Nine-Headed Demon Serpent perished in its tribulation, has another great sage unified the Demon Island?"</p><p>As he pondered, he channeled his spiritual energy, summoning a ray of light from Zhizhen's hand. Catching it, he frowned slightly. "Summon Chiling..."</p><p>Before he could finish, Li Yufu's expression suddenly changed. In a flash, his figure vanished.</p><p>Zhizhen, about to obey the order, hurried out of the hall, only to see Li Yufu standing in mid-air, hands behind his back, gazing upward.</p><p>Looking up, Zhizhen's face immediately showed shock.</p><p>...</p><p>Central Continent.</p><p>Moon Veil Nunnery.</p><p>"Junior Sister, have you decided?"</p><p>Abbess Yunxin stood before the statue of the founding ancestor, looking at Liuli, who knelt on a cushion with her hands clasped in prayer.</p><p>Liuli nodded. Her resolve was firm; once she made a decision, she would not waver.</p><p>Abbess Yunxin's eyes flashed with satisfaction as she smiled gently. "Junior Sister, you have not yet taken the vows. Removing your monastic cap is equivalent to returning to secular life."</p><p>She secretly praised her own foresight, having long sensed that Liuli's worldly ties were not yet severed. She had prevented her from taking the vows, and today it had come to pass.</p><p>With a gentle hand, Abbess Yunxin removed Liuli's monastic cap.</p><p>A cascade of black hair tumbled down!</p><p>Abbess Yunxin gently helped Liuli to her feet, and together they bowed to the statue of the founding ancestor, murmuring, "When the founding ancestor established the Moon Veil Nunnery and entered the monastic life, it was because she had experienced the depths of worldly sorrow and did not wish her descendants to suffer the same fate. Junior Sister, with your extraordinary talent, and Qin Zhenjun's deep sense of loyalty and righteousness, he will surely protect you through this tribulation. One day, you will ascend together and roam the vast cosmos! If the founding ancestor's spirit in the afterlife knows that her descendants have fulfilled her wish, she will surely..."</p><p>Before she could finish, both women sensed something. They exchanged a glance and hurried out of the hall, looking up at the sky.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Whether in the North Sea, the Demon Sea, the Central Continent, or the Western Lands, anyone outside could witness a strange phenomenon.</p><p>In the bright daylight, stars appeared in the sky.</p><p>Countless stars arranged themselves in the void, as if beyond the nine heavens, like a phantom, a reflection of the stars from another realm.</p><p>In an instant, the starlight converged and descended from the sky.</p><p>Some thought it was a divine object falling from the heavens, exclaiming in surprise. But before the starlight could land, a blood-red rainbow suddenly appeared, intercepting the starlight. The two seemed to cancel each other out, and both vanished.</p><p>In a flash, the strange phenomenon disappeared, and the stars faded.</p><p>In just a few moments, the world returned to normal.</p><p>Abbess Yunxin found it odd. With her cultivation, she could tell that both the starlight and the blood-red rainbow were beyond the highest heavens, their exact locations unclear. They might not even be in the Central Continent, only a faint glimpse of the starlight and the blood-red rainbow, fleeting and gone.</p><p>She could see nothing else, unsure of the origin or significance of the omen.</p><p>She instinctively glanced at Liuli beside her.</p><p>A gentle breeze stirred.</p><p>Liuli's long black hair fluttered slightly.</p><p>She felt an inexplicable unease, her delicate brows furrowing as she remained motionless.</p><p>...</p><p>The sound of waves crashing.</p><p>Though it was not a windy day, the waves were unusually high. While cultivators had no fear, mortal ships were at risk of capsizing.</p><p>The sunlight was dim, and the sea's color was nearly black, making the sky appear even darker.</p><p>This stretch of sea was endless, with no undulations or birds in sight. The only sound was the eternal roar of the waves.</p><p>Suddenly, a crack split the sky.</p><p>A flood of red light poured from the crack, like a crimson star falling from beyond the heavens, plummeting downward, its final destination unknown.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Nearby, a deafening roar erupted from the sea. A massive wave surged, and a crater appeared in the water. The sound of sizzling filled the air as steam rose, instantly covering several miles.</p><p>Within the crater.</p><p>A ball of fire continued to sink into the deep sea. Faintly visible within were two figures, their auras weak, exuding a strong scent of blood.</p><p>A moment later, one of them twitched. His eyes flickered with light as he sensed the dire state of his body, his expression darkening.</p><p>However, in his perception, this seemed to be a vast sea, with no threatening auras nearby. He couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>"It seems it didn't follow. Could it have been swept away by the spatial storm?"</p><p>This man was none other than Qin Sang. He muttered to himself, then his expression changed drastically as he hurriedly looked at his avatar beside him.</p><p>The avatar's face was unrecognizable, its body burning with black flames, covered in dense black patterns like countless twisted, snake-like runes, eerie and bizarre.</p><p>Within the avatar's body, the black patterns had spread throughout, even invading its soul.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar shared a single consciousness. He vaguely sensed that these black patterns, though not lethal, were extremely strange. The avatar was powerless against them, and for a moment, he couldn't think of any way to resist.</p><p>What alarmed Qin Sang even more was the feeling that the black patterns could spread from the avatar to his true body!</p><p>If the black patterns targeted the soul, Qin Sang wouldn't fear them. But clearly, that wasn't the case.</p><p>Moreover, he didn't know how to remove the black patterns. Though their purpose was unclear, given past experiences, he couldn't let them be!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned icy. Finally, he made a decision. With a finger pointed at the avatar's brow, the light in its eyes faded.</p><p>In the next moment, the avatar's form changed, shrinking into a palm-sized wooden doll.</p><p>He had voluntarily dispersed his second soul. The avatar that had accompanied him for so many years was no more, reverting to its original form as the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>As the second soul dispersed, the aggressive black patterns suddenly halted, as if sensing the host's death. They faltered, then disintegrated.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed the fluctuations had vanished but remained cautious. Without direct contact, he stored the wooden doll in his Thousand Jun Ring. With a shake of his body, he broke through the water's surface, emerging from the mist. He scanned the vast sea, finding no trace of anyone.</p><p>Looking up at the sky, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and the Sun God Tree appeared in his palm.</p><p>"Vermilion Bird?"</p><p>He called out, but there was no response.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the recent events.</p><p>He had just activated the summoning platform when, at the moment of breaking through the boundary, he sensed a deadly threat, as if some ferocious creature was hot on his heels.</p><p>Instinctively, he prepared to summon the Sun God Bird to fend off the enemy, but he heard the Vermilion Bird's screamâ€”"Ah, I'm dead!"</p><p>Then, the spiritual energy meant to control the Sun God Bird was redirected to the roots of the Sun God Tree, rushing toward the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, immediately guessing the Vermilion Bird's intent. In that critical moment, he had no choice but to trust it, pouring all his spiritual energy into the feather like a bursting dam. In an instant, his vast reserves were drained, leaving him nearly empty.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird had only recently obtained the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix. With Qin Sang's spiritual energy, it managed to activate the feather, forcibly breaking through the spatial storm's pressure. Qin Sang instinctively followed the feather's power, unsure of where he would end up.</p><p>Under the threat of the ferocious creature, he had no time to sense the starlight, nor did he know if he had been summoned to the upper realm by the guiding light.</p><p>At the final moment, a blood-red light broke through the spatial storm and struck. With his spiritual energy depleted, Qin Sang had no choice but to use his avatar to shield his true body. The avatar only had time to summon a wooden armor and unleash a beam of Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The wooden armor shattered instantly, its fragments scattering, lost to the void.</p><p>The residual force of the blood-red light severely injured both Qin Sang and his avatar. The avatar, having taken the brunt of the attack, was heavily damaged. Even Qin Sang, whose physical body was no weaker than a transformed demon king, felt as if his entire body was riddled with holes, his blood energy in turmoil, his injuries grave.</p><p>He gripped the Sun God Tree, sensing the Vermilion Bird's True Feather. Due to their oath, a faint connection had formed between him and the Vermilion Bird. He could sense that the young spirit of the Vermilion Bird still lingered, likely in a deep slumber.</p><p>Perhaps the forced activation of the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix had drained it too much.</p><p>"As long as the young spirit remains..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight relief, choosing not to disturb the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>This was a stroke of luck amidst misfortune. Though he had lost his avatar, at least he hadn't been captured by that ferocious creature.</p><p>"Is this the Great Thousand World?"</p><p>Apart from water, there was nothing else in sight. But Qin Sang was certain of one thing: he could no longer sense the Gate of Dao Markers!</p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers were gone!</p><p>He was sure he had left that realm. Whether this was the Great Thousand World remained to be seen.</p><p>Putting away the Sun God Tree, Qin Sang formed a hand seal. His blood energy immediately calmed, and his wounds began to scab over and fall off.</p><p>He was using the Inner Lion Seal he had learned from Master Huaiyin.</p><p>This seal was indeed extraordinary. Qin Sang felt his injuries heal completely, his body returning to its peak condition. With a firm step, he chose a direction and shot forward like an arrow.</p><p>This was no place to linger!</p><p>That ferocious creature might have been swept away by the spatial storm, but the commotion of his breakthrough was significant. If there were powerful beings nearby, they would surely notice.</p><p>Qin Sang spared no effort in using the Inner Lion Seal, determined to put as much distance as possible between himself and this place while the seal's effects lasted.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the sea quickly returned to its usual state.</p><p>Some time later.</p><p>A fierce wind suddenly rose over the sea, howling as the sky darkened. The turbulence of spiritual energy in the high heavens was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered from nowhere, forming a swirling mass. Within the clouds and wind, a faint shadow could be seen.</p><p>The gale did not last long.</p><p>In a moment, the wind dissipated, and the sky cleared.</p><p>...</p><p>After leaving that stretch of sea, Qin Sang chose a direction and raced forward, finally having the leisure to reflect on the recent events.</p><p>This sudden upheaval had disrupted everything.</p><p>His physical body had not yet broken through, the Kirin Origin Seed remained unrefined, his promises to Liuli and various factions were unfulfilled, and many secrets remained unsolved. Yet, he had been forced to ascend hastily, uncertain if he had even entered the Great Thousand World.</p><p>"Will I ever see them again?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of his old acquaintances, pondering silently.</p><p>If that ferocious creature was the source of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers, and he had taken it away, then the cultivators of that realm would once again have a path to advancement, at least a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. Such thoughts were meaningless now.</p><p>The urgent matter was to find a place to settle. Once the effects of the Inner Lion Seal wore off, his injuries would worsen. He needed to heal and recover his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, Qin Sang felt his blood energy growing restless. He knew the Inner Lion Seal's effects were about to fade.</p><p>He paused briefly, scanning the horizon. Still no land in sight. Along the way, the islands he had seen were sparse. In his current state, he dared not approach, so he had no idea what kind of cultivation methods the practitioners here employed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt this place was still not far enough, not safe enough. Glancing at the sea, he sensed a powerful ocean current beneath him.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he retrieved an object from his Thousand Jun Ringâ€”a glowing sphere, the Taiyi Star Chariot.</p><p>Since obtaining this treasure, he had studied it extensively. Though he hadn't repaired it and couldn't use it to fly, he could still enter the chariot to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had been perched on his shoulder all along, using its Heavenly Eye ability to stay alert.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, after its fourth transformation, had developed a body of golden armor and iron bones.</p><p>With these two insects guarding him, he could likely handle most situations.</p><p>As if sensing his thoughts, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly gently brushed Qin Sang's right cheek with its soft wings, as if reassuring him to focus on healing.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, the gloom in his heart lifting slightly. He stroked the butterfly's wings, murmuring, "At least I still have you with me... Once I recover, I'll help you break through!"</p><p>With that, he took out several small bottles and swallowed the pills inside. Pointing at the Taiyi Star Chariot, a beam of green light shot out, and he entered it.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chariot's light dimmed, turning into an inconspicuous jade sphere. Light and agile, it floated beneath the sea's surface, carried by the Fire Jade Centipede, drifting further and further with the current.</p><p>...</p><p>One year later.</p><p>A rocky shoal.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chariot arrived here and came to a halt. A burst of light erupted, and Qin Sang stepped out, looking at the island before him.</p><p>After drifting at sea for a year, he was now very far from where he had fallen.</p><p>This was still not the mainland, but an island. However, Qin Sang could see from a distance that the island was vast, with abundant spiritual energy, making it a good place for recuperation.</p><p>After a moment's observation, Qin Sang frowned slightly. Though the island's vegetation was lush, it lacked the vitality of a thriving forest. The trees' branches were twisted and gnarled, their shapes bizarre, giving off a somewhat sinister vibe even in broad daylight.</p><p>Moreover...</p><p>"Why are there so many spirits on this island?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. While plants could gain sentience, it was rare for them to do so naturally. Yet, in this small patch of forest before him, there were over a hundred spirits, though their cultivation levels were not high, the strongest only equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The plant spirits frolicked among the trees, oblivious to the uninvited guest who had arrived on their island.</p><p>Uncertain if there were any powerful demons on the island, Qin Sang concealed his presence and slipped into the forest, not disturbing any of the spirits. He wasn't in a hurry to reach the island's center, instead finding a cave to meditate in.</p><p>"The spiritual energy of this realm is indeed dense. Even if it's not the Great Thousand World, it's far superior to the previous realm!"</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation for another month.</p><p>He focused on refining healing pills and regulating his blood energy. His physical condition improved, and the injuries to his dantian and meridians gradually healed. Worried that absorbing spiritual energy might cause fluctuations and attract unwanted attention, he initially relied solely on spirit stones and pills for recovery.</p><p>Once he confirmed there were no powerful demons on the island, he began to cultivate freely.</p><p>Instantly, the surrounding spiritual energy converged toward him.</p><p>Suddenly, the spiritual energy dispersed abruptly.</p><p>A muffled groan echoed in the cave. Qin Sang clutched his dantian, his expression grave.</p><p>Just moments ago, as he absorbed spiritual energy into his body, he felt his true essence becoming unstable. The turbulence nearly caused his recently healed meridians to suffer further damage.</p><p>It wasn't that the spiritual energy was incompatible with him!</p><p>Rather, it seemed the natural energy of this realm was in chaos!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered somethingâ€”the remains and demon core of that Thunder Tortoise. The energy contained within them felt eerily similar to this sensation!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
