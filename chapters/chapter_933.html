<h1>Chapter 925: The Crimson Gauze</h1><p>Two figures clashed, then separated instantly.</p><p>One stumbled backward, their footing unsteady.</p><p>The other, seemingly also strained, paused briefly before resuming the attack, calling out, "Let's finish this together."</p><p>Having gauged his current strength, Qin Sang was no longer interested in prolonging the fight with Fang. He summoned his avatar and the Twin-Headed Serpent to join forces and eliminate him.</p><p>Fang, a direct disciple of a Nascent Soul elder from the Witch Clan, proved his worth with a constant stream of techniques. Coupled with the insect armor conjured by his third metamorphosis spirit insect, ordinary attacks hardly fazed him.</p><p>Qin Sang had used the Blood Defilement Divine Light to disable Fang’s blood sword in a surprise attack. However, without using the Star Conch, he could only suppress him, not kill him.</p><p>Their battle had long since moved beyond the small island. Fang repeatedly attempted to escape, but Qin Sang easily intercepted him every time.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent then joined the fray, dramatically shifting the balance.</p><p>The avatar, already at late Core Formation and similarly armored, coordinated seamlessly with the serpent. It waited patiently for the opportune moment to unleash its Shadow Flash ability.</p><p>The tide had turned.  Facing enemies from three directions, Fang was overwhelmed. Defeat was inevitable. And with Qin Sang's superior escape techniques, he had no chance of fleeing.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange glint appeared in Fang's eyes. His palm flashed with a blinding light, revealing a peculiar talisman that transformed into a sharp cone.</p><p>Simultaneously, a crimson dot bloomed on his purple insect armor's chest, spreading like a blood flower, instantly engulfing his entire form.</p><p>The already fractured phantom of the Amethyst Sky Armor visibly re-solidified, mirroring the insect armor’s transformation into a grotesque blood shadow.</p><p>The blood-red Amethyst Sky Armor opened its massive eyes, radiating a ferocious aura.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Fang roared, charging towards Qin Sang with the cone.</p><p>The cone instantly drained the surrounding spiritual energy, appearing unstoppable and terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang could only see the cone's swirling tip, as if it could suck in his very soul.</p><p>At the same time, the blood-red Amethyst Sky Armor let out a deafening shriek, its blood light flaring. With a sudden lurch, it sent Qin Sang's avatar flying. Then, lunging forward, it merged with Fang, locking onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Fang had used a forbidden secret technique of his sect to enhance his natal insect蛊, at the cost of his future potential.</p><p>But in his current predicament, he couldn't afford to worry about the future.</p><p>He targeted Qin Sang’s true body, knowing that if he killed him, no one could stop him, rendering the other two opponents irrelevant.</p><p>This was his desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was grave, but a sneer played on his lips.</p><p>From the side, the Twin-Headed Serpent moved with surprising speed. Arching its back and hissing, it launched a blur of green towards Fang’s side.</p><p>Fang seemed oblivious, neither dodging nor flinching.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Struck by the green blur, the blood-red Amethyst Sky Armor shrieked. The blood shadow trembled. Fang struggled to regain his balance, his eyes fixated solely on Qin Sang.</p><p>In the next moment, Fang's expression drastically changed.</p><p>A point of blue light rapidly expanded in his vision. Capitalizing on the disruption caused by the green blur, it pierced the blood-red Amethyst Sky Armor.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A resounding crash followed by a crisp cracking sound.</p><p>Fang groaned, thrown backward. The cone in his hand was nearly disintegrated. Cracks spiderwebbed his insect armor. The blood-red Amethyst Sky Armor froze.</p><p>His face was pale, blood trickling from his lips.  He tried to move, but felt a chill on the back of his neck. A powerful force struck, shattering his armor completely.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Star Conch, flying towards Fang. He and his avatar attacked in tandem, aiming for vital points.</p><p>Soon, Fang’s lifeless body lay in Qin Sang’s grasp.</p><p>"My combat prowess with both physical and magical cultivation, utilizing the sword wheel, is already comparable to a peak Core Formation cultivator.  The sword wheel’s power can be further enhanced, likely through the sword path..."</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the battle. He had dominated the fight, only briefly surprised by Fang's final gambit, which he easily countered.</p><p>It wasn't unexpected. Fang, as a disciple of a Nascent Soul elder, would naturally possess life-saving techniques.</p><p>He flipped his hand, retrieving the Star Platform.</p><p>He had hoped to search Fang’s soul for the true method of activating this treasure, but it was in vain.</p><p>“This guy didn't know the true origin of the Star Platform either. The Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch claimed it was a Witch Clan treasure. That's why the Barrier Breakers Sect, despite possessing it for so long, failed to uncover its true purpose, using it merely as a tool to aid in cultivating the ‘Commanding Thunder Technique.’  A Witch Clan treasure… what kind of treasure is it that warrants the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch’s intervention?  And the Star Platform's crescent shape is also peculiar.  I tested it with Divine Runes on a random Witch Clan cultivator in the Gale Archipelago, but there was no reaction…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Star Platform from every angle.</p><p>He had tried countless times over the years, but the Star Platform’s secrets remained elusive.</p><p>"Enough!  It aids my cultivation of the ‘Celestial Demon Body Refinement,’ which is already a pleasant surprise," Qin Sang sighed, putting the platform away and collecting Fang's belongings.</p><p>"It's a shame the Blood Corpse Insects were already retrieved by the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch!  This blood sword is a valuable mid-grade magic treasure, but it’s not as comfortable as my natal spirit sword. I'll give it to my avatar for now. This Crimson Gauze is interesting though, not something from this era…"</p><p>Qin Sang held a piece of soft red gauze.  Even as a skilled refiner, he couldn't identify its material. Even the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch couldn't repair it.</p><p>This treasure could conceal one's aura. Fang had used it to mask his identity, moving freely within human territories.</p><p>After examining it, Qin Sang tossed the body to his avatar, returned to the island, meticulously erased all traces of the battle, and then departed.</p><p>Relying on the Celestial Demon Body Refinement, Qin Sang moved freely through the Demonic Sea. He didn't return to Toad Island to take a spirit boat, instead embarking on his return journey alone, deliberately avoiding contact with other cultivators.</p><p>This way, even if the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch personally investigated, he wouldn't be able to track him.</p><p>With this matter settled, Qin Sang waited for the Seven Kills Palace to open.</p><p>Before that, he would help his avatar refine the absorbed blood orbs, sufficient to elevate it to peak Core Formation.  With some time remaining before the Seven Kills Palace opened, Qin Sang found a deserted island in the Demonic Sea, established a cave dwelling, and entered seclusion with his avatar.</p><p>During his seclusion, Qin Sang reviewed his preparations.</p><p>He had done everything within his power. Whether he could achieve his goals in the Seven Kills Palace now depended on fate.</p>
