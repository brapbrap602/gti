<h1>Chapter 831 External Avatar</h1><p>After returning to his cave, Qin Sang focused his mind.</p><p>His External Avatar walked out.</p><p>“Welcome back, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>The External Avatar bowed to him, indistinguishable from a real person, with almost no flaws visible.</p><p>Every time he saw the External Avatar's actions, Qin Sang would subconsciously feel a sense of alarm.</p><p>According to the secret art "Seed Primordial Demonic Embryo," when the External Avatar also breaks through to the Nascent Soul stage, the cultivator will have a second Nascent Soul, equivalent to a second life.</p><p>If something happens to the main body, they can be resurrected through the External Avatar.</p><p>However, the cost of this transformation is immense and difficult to accept.</p><p>When taking over the External Avatar and transforming into the second Nascent Soul, the cultivator will be weakened for a very long time, at least for centuries. If a Heavenly Tribulation comes during this period, there will be no way to resist it.</p><p>In addition, the future path of cultivation will also be affected, every step becoming difficult.</p><p>Still, it's better than losing one's life.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure yet whether the secret art, modified by Senior Qing Zhu, still retained this effect.</p><p>This switching between the main body and the avatar gave Qin Sang a sense of absurdity. Which one was truly him? If the avatar rebelled, wouldn't it be equivalent to him killing himself?</p><p>"Seed Primordial Demonic Embryo" clearly stated that the higher the cultivation of the External Avatar, the greater the risk of backlash. It was not impossible for the External Avatar to usurp the main body, so cultivators must be extremely cautious.</p><p>Therefore, when refining the External Avatar, it was possible to merge its emotions with his own, but Qin Sang refused to do so, severing the split soul's memories and trying to prevent the External Avatar from becoming too closely connected to him.</p><p>Anyway, Nascent Soul formation was still a long way off.</p><p>It was even more difficult for the External Avatar to achieve Nascent Soul formation, the chances being slim. With the second Nascent Soul far in the future, Qin Sang wouldn't put himself in such a precarious situation for a vague hope.</p><p>Qin Sang told the External Avatar to go back.</p><p>The Primordial Embryo had not yet been successfully nurtured and would require more time. Qin Sang ordered the External Avatar to cultivate alone in the cave, never stepping outside, and set up isolating restrictions.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang prepared for his departure, and after helping the External Avatar refine its cultivation, morning arrived.</p><p>He sealed the cave and went to see Madam Liu.</p><p>...</p><p>The shopkeeper led Qin Sang into the back room. Madam Liu was visibly relieved to see him.</p><p>She had clearly been worried that Qin Sang would change his mind.</p><p>“Daoist Priest, you finally came!”</p><p>Madam Liu stood up and said repeatedly, “Is there anything else you wish to purchase? If not, let’s depart.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then suddenly frowned and asked, “Has Madam Liu been moving around using your true appearance?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Madam Liu smiled slightly and took out a mask as thin as a cicada's wing. After putting it on, she instantly transformed into a different person, even her demeanor changing slightly.</p><p>“This mask was lent to me by an old friend of my husband's.  Thankfully, with this treasure, I’ve been able to track Xiang Yi without being discovered.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. This mask was actually a magical treasure. After Madam Liu put it on, he couldn't see any flaws, but other than that, it didn't seem to have any other function.</p><p>It seemed extravagant to refine a magical treasure solely for changing one's appearance.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang secretly used the Sky Eye Butterfly to observe with its Sky Eye, he noticed some slight flaws.  The face looked a bit unnatural, showing that the treasure's ability was limited.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn't expose this.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly's ability was unique.  This mask was more than enough to deceive Xiang Yi.</p><p>Having altered their appearances, the two set off together toward the sacred mountain with the teleportation formation.  Arriving at the Teleportation Hall, they found that very few people were entering, while many were exiting.</p><p>This scene made Qin Sang realize that the turmoil in the Demon Sea was escalating, even causing him to question his own decision.</p><p>Upon learning they were going to the Demon Sea, the cultivator in charge of the teleportation said, “Few cultivators are heading to the Demon Sea now. You two will have to wait until we have enough people to activate the formation.”</p><p>The two bought a teleportation talisman and waited patiently. After a long time, enough people finally gathered.</p><p>...</p><p>The salty sea breeze filled their nostrils, carrying a faint demonic and bloody scent.</p><p>Returning to Great Wilderness Island, Qin Sang clearly sensed the atmosphere had become much heavier.</p><p>A long queue had formed at the teleportation hall back to the Canglang Sea. These were all cultivators who could afford the teleportation fee. Many other cultivators and mortals could only wait here, facing an uncertain fate.</p><p>The harbor was filled with ships, coming and going constantly. It was essential to travel in groups.</p><p>The advantage was that after Qin Sang and Madam Liu found a ship, not only did they not have to pay, but the captain offered them spirit stones, asking them to provide assistance in case of danger.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of panic throughout the Demon Sea.  Even the Liu couple, who frequently traveled in the Demon Sea, had never encountered such a scene before.</p><p>Madam Liu had prepared two false identities in advance.  Qin Sang and Madam Liu disguised themselves and boarded the ship discreetly.</p><p>The ship sailed on.</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with other cultivators to learn about the situation in the Demon Sea. He learned that the Nascent Soul patriarchs who ruled the islands were uniting, planning to jointly resist the beast tide, and were also recruiting experts.</p><p>Many reclusive powerful figures couldn't continue their secluded cultivation and emerged one after another, joining forces to confront the demon race.</p><p>The two island lords who had previously abandoned their islands hadn't done so without resistance. It had been a strategic retreat.  With reinforcements and assistance from various factions, they would gather experts, rely on some of the larger islands, and fear no demon.</p><p>“This isn’t the barbaric era anymore. So many powerful figures have entered the Demon Sea, and various factions have interests here, having invested significant resources. They won’t let the demon race destroy everything so easily.”</p><p>This cultivator was quite confident, prepared to seek fortune amidst danger.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that these words made sense. The various factions on the surface, both righteous and demonic, the three major merchant alliances, and the Wu Clan all valued the resources of the Demon Sea greatly. Especially for the three major merchant alliances and the Wu Clan, the Demon Sea was their future hope.</p><p>The destruction of their foundations in the Demon Sea would represent an unbearable loss. They would certainly do everything in their power to protect those crucial locations.</p><p>The demon race was powerful, but not to the point of completely eradicating the human and Wu races.</p><p>Of course, the unusual activity of the demon race was a real phenomenon, and no one dared to underestimate it. Everyone was on high alert.</p><p>Along the way, the fleet was frequently harassed by demon beasts. While slaying these beasts, Qin Sang unexpectedly met a female cultivator from another ship, who came from Gloomy Sky Island.</p><p>“I also spent some time on Gloomy Sky Island.  I remember it was shortly after the Wu Clan rebellion ended. There were rumors about Skyfire appearing outside the island, heralding the emergence of a Nascent Soul treasure. Was it true? Who obtained the treasure?”</p><p>Qin Sang inquired quickly.</p><p>He wasn't sure how much attention the Winter Nether Cold Flame had attracted, so he could only speak vaguely.</p><p>The female cultivator looked at Qin Sang in surprise, “Fellow Daoist is well-informed. I only heard whispers after the fact. It was said that Venerable Winter Nether's resting place was discovered, and his divine ability, the Winter Nether Cold Flame, emerged.  His cave contained his legacy treasures.  In the end, the Island Lord invited the old demon Mou Lue to subdue the Cold Flame. I presume the treasures fell into their hands.”</p>
