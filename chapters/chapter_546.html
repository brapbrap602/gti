<h1>Chapter 539: High-Grade Spirit Stones!</h1><p>This greatly exceeded Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>He had assumed the Ten Directions Yama Banner was Kui Yin Old Ancestor's life-bound treasure, but it wasn't.</p><p>The *Yin煞 Ancient Book* did not contain the method for refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense from the jade slip, pondered for a moment, then suddenly remembered something.  His gaze swept across the items before him, selecting a diamond-like transparent shard.</p><p>After studying the *Yin煞 Ancient Book*, Qin Sang recognized the shard as a piece of the Yin Thunder Pearl,  the life-bound treasure of Jiu Pao Dao Ren, which had been shattered in the explosion at the Yuanzhao Sect by the Sect Master.</p><p>“So tragic…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, feeling sorry for Jiu Pao Dao Ren.</p><p>His precious Yin Thunder Pearl was not only destroyed but reduced to a fragment the size of a fingernail, almost completely ruined.  No wonder he hadn't been able to repair his life-bound treasure; it was practically the same as refining a new one.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it for a while, then tossed the fragment aside. He lacked the ability to gather so many precious spiritual materials to repair the Yin Thunder Pearl.</p><p>Even if he could repair it, he wouldn't.</p><p>Other people's life-bound treasures are difficult to truly utilize; their power will always be slightly weaker. It's better to refine a new one. Besides, the Yin Thunder Pearl is most effective when used with the *Yin煞 Ancient Book*.</p><p>Used by someone else, its power would be even weaker.</p><p>Putting down the *Yin煞 Ancient Book*, Qin Sang tirelessly went through each jade slip one by one, but still found no method for refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Kui Yin Old Ancestor must have passed down the secret technique, otherwise Jiu Pao Dao Ren wouldn't have been able to repair the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The Kui Yin Sect, after the death of Kui Yin Old Ancestor, has been unable to complete the Ten Directions Yama Banner, probably due to the inability to find new Nine Netherworld Demon Flames.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly noticed a dark, obsidian-like object.  His heart stirred, and he drew it closer, discovering that it was made of the same material as the poles of the Ten Directions Yama Banner!</p><p>This piece of obsidian was quite large, a regular cylinder, half a person’s height and thick enough to embrace, enough material to refine more than a dozen poles.</p><p>Actually, calling it obsidian isn't quite accurate. Its material is neither iron nor stone, very peculiar and unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen before.</p><p>Moreover, the obsidian pillar's shape was too regular, not naturally formed, but rather artificially refined.</p><p>Having spent so many years in the cultivation world, he was no longer the ignorant little cultivator he once was, yet he had never heard of a similar material.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to use his true essence to refine it, but not even a trace was left.</p><p>When he took out the Ten Directions Yama Banner and used the Nine Netherworld Demon Flame to refine it, he was surprised to find that the Nine Netherworld Demon Flame seemed afraid of the obsidian pillar, cowering back.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was certain that the poles of the Ten Directions Yama Banner were made from a similar obsidian pillar!</p><p>What about the banner itself?</p><p>Qin Sang immediately searched frantically, but found nothing similar.</p><p>“It seems I’ll have to wait until I have more time to study it later.  However, this obsidian pillar is definitely not simple.  Once I figure out what material it is, I might be able to refine a unique treasure. Jiu Pao Dao Ren’s notes on the Yin Xuan Tower in the *Yin煞 Ancient Book* seemed to have something to do with the obsidian pillar; did he plan to use it to refine the Yin Xuan Tower? Unfortunately, there are only a few sentences, and it doesn't mention how to refine the obsidian pillar…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>He reminded himself to be more careful with the Ten Directions Yama Banner in the future and not destroy another pole.</p><p>Jiu Pao Dao Ren was incredibly impoverished.  Aside from the obsidian pillar, there were no other treasures that surprised Qin Sang.  Of the things he had taken away, only that pile of jade slips remained.</p><p>It seemed that gathering healing medicines and establishing the Demon Flame Sect had drained his resources.</p><p>Now, in the iron finger ring, there were still many various healing pills.  Qin Sang carefully sorted and stored them, then found two talisman treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t really value talisman treasures anymore; his two treasures and the Ten Directions Yama Array were far more powerful.  Nevertheless, he carefully put them away.</p><p>Then he opened his own pouch and transferred everything into the iron finger ring.</p><p>Finally, there was a pile of spirit stones left on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his spiritual sense over them, and his expression suddenly changed. A look of extreme surprise appeared on his face. He used his hand to pick out four spirit stones from the pile – one yellowish-brown, one greenish-blue, and two reddish.</p><p>These four spirit stones all had sealing restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly picked up one of the reddish spirit stones, carefully opening a crack in the restriction.  Immediately, an incredibly pure and astonishing spiritual energy surged towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, a look of intoxication on his face, exclaiming, "These are top-grade spirit stones!"</p><p>In all his years in the cultivation world, this was the first time Qin Sang had ever seen a top-grade spirit stone.  The common practice is that a top-grade spirit stone can be exchanged for one hundred mid-grade spirit stones, but trying to actually make that exchange is a fool's errand!</p><p>Top-grade spirit stones are legendary, even rare treasures in the ancient cultivation world.  In the Xiaohan region, any mines containing them have long been exhausted.  It's said that the pure spiritual energy they contain is easily detectable, making them impossible to hide underground without powerful seals.</p><p>If it weren't for the occasional discovery of new realms within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, yielding a few top-grade spirit stones with luck, these stones would be even rarer now. Even then, the supply is insufficient, mostly monopolized by major sects, rarely seen outside.</p><p>Many powerful spirit arrays and restrictions, especially ancient arrays unearthed from those realms, require top-grade spirit stones to function. Without them, even the most powerful arrays remain unusable.</p><p>Furthermore, in combat, using top-grade spirit stones allows for much faster recovery, potentially turning the tide of a battle.</p><p>"I knew that old ghost, Jiupao, couldn't have been so poor after looting the Kuiyin Sect's treasures!"</p><p>Qin Sang, his face beaming, fondled the four top-grade spirit stones. The Kuiyin Sect, only a few hundred years old, hadn't yet exhausted the legacy of its founder, Kuiyin Ancestor, so possessing top-grade spirit stones wasn't entirely unexpected.</p><p>"No wonder that old ghost, despite his damaged treasures and severe injuries, fought so fiercely, nearly destroying the Flying Night Rakshasa. He had top-grade spirit stones! That final explosion was probably powered by them too.  But..."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, puzzled. "Why didn't that old ghost use these four stones to buy healing pills? Was he afraid of revealing his identity and his treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, unable to fathom Jiupao Daoist's reasoning.  Perhaps he had more than four initially, and used some to purchase pills.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang carefully put them away. Using them for cultivation would be faster, but too wasteful.  He couldn't think of any other use besides quick recovery during a fight, but such treasures were certainly better to have in abundance.</p>
