<h1>Chapter 544: Instinctive Peril</h1><p>Chapter 544: Instinctive Peril</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountain peak, hands behind his back, surveying the world.  Reflecting on his past experiences, he considered the period of hopelessness and his failed attempts at Golden Core cultivation.  Compared to that, this so-called foundational injury was merely a minor ailment; what was there to fear?</p><p>Along the way, although there were many hardships, he had finally emerged from the darkness. A grand path lay ahead, and the future shone brightly.  For a moment, Qin Sang felt a surge of elation, so strong he wanted to roar to the heavens!</p><p>His roar was like thunder, continuous and reverberating through the mountains and fields.  Suddenly, a sword light appeared, soaring into the wind.  A favorable wind lends power, lifting me to the clouds!…</p><p>West of the Qingyang Demon Sect, in a small human city, an old Daoist with a refined air borrowed a table and chairs from a teahouse. He set up a stall by the roadside, planting a banner in the ground that boldly proclaimed, "Wandering the Myriad Worlds, Known as the Half-Immortal."</p><p>A sharp-featured, frivolous yamen runner named Jia stood beside him, seeking advice on marriage. The crowd of people seeking medicine and fortune-telling initially surrounding the Daoist scattered like they were avoiding a plague upon the yamen runner's arrival.</p><p>“Sir, your appearance suggests great wealth and prosperity. Wealth and poverty are opposites. If you marry that poor girl, she will not only bring you no good fortune, but she will also hinder you, bring you misfortune, and even negate all your existing good luck…” The Daoist, undeterred by the yamen runner, shook his head and muttered.</p><p>The yamen runner, startled, pointed at his face, “You can see that from my face?”</p><p>“Of course, otherwise how could I be called a Half-Immortal…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, the Daoist sensed something, turned his head towards the city walls, abandoned his jesting, grabbed the tortoise shell from his table, and smacked the yamen runner on the head three times.</p><p>“Ouch! You old geezer, you dare hit me! Ouch! Ouch!”</p><p>The yamen runner, despite his decent martial skills, was unable to dodge or retaliate, falling to the ground in pain.  The Daoist shouted, "Lust and wickedness will bring calamity!"</p><p>When the yamen runner recovered, only the fortune-telling stall remained; the Daoist had vanished.</p><p>“A real immortal…”</p><p>The yamen runner, terrified and deflated, clutched his head and slunk away.  From that day forward, whenever the yamen runner entertained wicked thoughts, the Daoist's last warning echoed in his ears, inescapable, gradually reforming him.</p><p>Of course, this is a story for another time. This Daoist was Yunyouzi, waiting for Qin Sang in the city.  Bored, he had taken up the profession he practiced in the mortal world – fortune-telling.</p><p>Yunyouzi left the city on foot.  He seemed to possess the ability to shorten distances, moving swiftly yet seemingly slowly, reaching a small hill outside the city in just a few steps.</p><p>A sword light arrived at the same moment, circling the hilltop before descending in front of Yunyouzi, revealing Qin Sang.</p><p>“Qin, you look radiant, your gloominess has vanished, you've achieved your goal, haven't you?”</p><p>Yunyouzi sized Qin Sang up, noting his newfound confidence, vastly different from his previous demeanor, understanding that he must have gained something significant.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and thanked him, “I haven't properly thanked you for your help.  The beast tide in Wuyagu Valley was likely your doing, wasn't it?”</p><p>Yunyouzi smiled slightly. “How else could I lure a Golden Core cultivator from the Qingyang Demon Sect? I learned a few methods to attract beasts while investigating Tianyao Hill. I planned to incite two beast groups to fight, but by a twist of fate, I triggered a minor beast tide in the Qingyang Demon Sect disciples' training grounds. It saved me a lot of trouble.”</p><p>“I see.” Qin Sang understood.  Seeing Yunyouzi’s reluctance to elaborate, he didn't press further.</p><p>“What did you gain, have you sensed the opportunity for Golden Core cultivation?” Yunyouzi asked curiously.</p><p>“Thanks to you, senior…”</p><p>Qin Sang had no need to hide anything from Yunyouzi.  He briefly explained his decision to halt his Golden Core attempt and his accidental discovery of the usefulness of the Celestial and Terrestrial煞 energy in the process.</p><p>If Yunyouzi wanted the detailed method for Golden Core cultivation, Qin Sang would gladly share it. However, the method of condensing煞 and refining罡 using the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* was certainly not suitable for Yunyouzi; he would need to find his own path.</p><p>“Celestial and Terrestrial煞 energy can assist in Golden Core cultivation? That's unheard of. Those things are extremely dangerous; only you would dare to try,” Yunyouzi, however, showed little interest in the cultivation method itself. He sighed, then praised Qin Sang's choice. “You were able to maintain your resolve even with the temptation of the Golden Core; I haven’t misjudged you!”</p><p>“Birds of a feather flock together.  I’ve learned so much from observing and following you, senior,” Qin Sang said earnestly.</p><p>He owed his unwavering determination to the subtle influence of Yun Youzi, his mentor though not officially his master.  In Qin Sang's heart, Yun Youzi was his guiding light.</p><p>Yun Youzi stroked his beard and chuckled, "I haven't got your patience, little brother. If my spirit weren't incompatible, I'd have already formed my golden core. Since your hidden injury hinders your core formation, obtaining the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit is essential. The Purple Micro Palace is about to open; we should head to Xuanlu Pass early and plan carefully."</p><p>"I intend to do just that…"</p><p>…</p><p>The two returned directly to Shao Hua Mountain.  Passing the Shangyuan Quiet Palace, Yun Youzi parted ways with Qin Sang, choosing to proceed to Xuanlu Pass without visiting Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to check on Flying Night Rakshasa and, after setting a meeting place with Yun Youzi, they went their separate ways.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Flying Night Rakshasa's injuries wouldn't heal quickly.  </p><p>But he was a changed man.  </p><p>In the process of transforming himself into the Flying Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang had gained a deeper understanding of Corpse Pills.  Previously helpless to aid its recovery, he could now leverage his experience to accelerate the healing process.  The Flying Night Rakshasa was indispensable for the Purple Micro Palace journey; he had to cure it.</p><p>Watching Yun Youzi's escaping light recede, Qin Sang was about to fly south when he paused, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>After a moment, the inexplicable bloodlust subsided.  Qin Sang relaxed, letting out a barely perceptible sigh.</p><p>After removing the Heaven Corpse Talisman, Qin Sang immediately took the prepared pills to dispel the corpse qi in his body.  However, the accumulated corpse qi after forming his Corpse Pill was far stronger than during his living corpse stage.</p><p>Superficially, no trace of his corpse transformation remained, but he alone knew he wasn't truly cured.  That bloodthirsty instinct would periodically resurface.  It wasn't severe, but it was bothersome.</p><p>He had tried many methods to eradicate it, to no avail. He had also discreetly inquired with Yun Youzi, but there was no solution except for forming a golden core.  The influx of spiritual energy during core formation and the subsequent physical transformation of the cultivator would easily erase the aftereffects of the corpse transformation; until then, he could only endure.</p><p>Fortunately, his dantian was stabilized by the five Yin objects and his golden core had taken the brunt of the fierce energy impact; the damage was minimal and fully healed.</p>
