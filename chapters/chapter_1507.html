<h1>Chapter 1498: Terror</h1><p>Chapter 1498: Terror</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The snake’s flames raged.</p><p>Waves of icy flames rained down, a breathtakingly beautiful yet terrifying sight.  Qin Sang and Yin Changsheng's battle was far more spectacular than Tong Lingyu's;  the cave, except for the Blood Pool of Yin, was completely devastated.</p><p>The snake repeatedly lashed its long tail, each strike like a blue lightning bolt, nearly shattering the Seven Souls Killing Formation with its immense destructive power.</p><p>Icy flames danced in the air. Qin Sang and Liuli were like fragile ancient people struggling to survive a brutal winter, clinging to each other against a terrifying beast, constantly on the brink of death, their bodies potential prey.</p><p>Liuli completely entrusted herself to Qin Sang, focusing all her attention on their struggle with Yin Changsheng for the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang held Liuli, his face bloodied, looking extremely wretched, forced to retreat again and again.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation, the only sword formation recorded in the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen*,  bravely withstood the spiritual treasure, repeatedly collapsing yet miraculously reviving at the last moment.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had initially believed he would easily defeat Qin Sang, but fate had other plans.  Qin Sang was clearly heavily wounded, teetering on the brink of defeat. Yet, just as he seemed about to fall, he would unleash some kind of potential-enhancing secret technique, suddenly gaining a burst of strength to overcome the crisis.</p><p>At this point, Yin Changsheng finally understood: he had been tricked!</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng couldn't possibly imagine that his psychic attacks hadn't harmed Qin Sang at all.  He only assumed Qin Sang had a way to protect his primordial spirit, and his injuries weren't as severe as they appeared.</p><p>Yin Changsheng flew into a rage.</p><p>The snake’s attacks grew even more ferocious, mirroring its master’s fury.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred. Yin Changsheng's frustration was growing with each passing moment, the influence of the dark arts subtly deepening. If this continued, Tong Lingyu's plan might actually succeed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt this strategy was flawed. It relied entirely on his opponent's weaknesses. Any unexpected development, such as the opponent possessing an unforeseen trump card, would render all his efforts futile.</p><p>He possessed the Solar God Tree. Could the esteemed Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace truly only have these few methods?</p><p>Throughout his cultivation journey, Qin Sang had never passively waited for death; he had always actively seized opportunities, enabling him to repeatedly escape danger.</p><p>Then,</p><p>Yin Changsheng used the same tactic again.</p><p>The snake opened its huge mouth, its body once more merging with the icy flames.</p><p>The flames blazed like a cold sun, emitting a ghostly glow, transforming the cave into a complete ice cavern. Any low-level cultivator entering would likely freeze to death instantly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The icy flames shot out.</p><p>They fell like meteors, impossibly fast.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim. While he could repeatedly avert crises, he could only defend himself; he couldn't find a chance to counterattack, walking a tightrope, his spirit severely strained.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword trembled, emitting a clear ringing sound, once again forming a sword formation, tirelessly protecting its master.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Brilliant streams of fire pierced the dark sword formation, powerful and unstoppable, obliterating countless sword threads.</p><p>Unsurprisingly,</p><p>The sword formation was pierced again.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. He slightly tightened his grip on Liuli, shifting them dozens of feet. From the start of the battle, he had been circling the edge of the cave, his mind fixated on the blood pool, gradually making a new discovery.</p><p>The aura associated with the Blood Pool of Yin seemed connected not to Yin Changsheng himself, but to the ice coffin!</p><p>Whooshed!</p><p>Qin Sang landed, before he could regain his footing, he sensed something above, a sudden warning in his heart.</p><p>Above them, in the swirling mist, a white hand appeared.</p><p>The hand, fingers spread wide like an eagle's talons, swiftly snatched at Liuli.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had anticipated Qin Sang’s landing spot; the hand's speed was incredible, leaving them no time to dodge.</p><p>It was somewhat similar to the secret technique used by the cultivator surnamed Yue during the Cleansing Pool trials.</p><p>However, this white hand was smaller than the one used by the cultivator surnamed Yue, yet far more substantial, surpassing it in both speed and power.</p><p>"Another top-tier secret technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace must have countless secret techniques hidden within its vaults. Yin Changsheng, the head of the sect, truly lived up to his title; his mastery of top-tier secret techniques was endless. Qin Sang could only react defensively.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The hand was lightning fast.</p><p>In that critical moment, a decisive look flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Then, a silver-white thread of lightning shot from Qin Sang's dantian, striking the hand’s palm before it could connect.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The hand froze, shattering and vanishing before their very eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were unharmed.</p><p>Lei Si, seemingly frail and weak, easily countered the attack.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't continue to hide, so she revealed another secret technique, using her Celestial Eye radiance to resolve the crisis.  After the Celestial Eye Butterfly's advancement, the Celestial Eye radiance was slightly improved, making her timing more precise – this was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>Such opportunities are rare during a fight, so it wasn't wasted.</p><p>However, it wasn't good news for Qin Sang. Each secret technique used is one less for later.  Next time, Yin Changsheng will be prepared, and it won't be as effective.</p><p>The secret technique was inexplicably broken.</p><p>Yin Changsheng hadn't anticipated this, his expression stiffening.</p><p>His eyes fixed on Qin Sang's lower abdomen; the Celestial Eye radiance had appeared too suddenly, he hadn't seen clearly if it was a magic weapon or something else.</p><p>For a moment, the underground cavern fell strangely silent.</p><p>“Huff! Huff!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli darted to the other side, panting, quickly swallowing several spirit pills – better than nothing.</p><p>The Jin Chen sword silently returned.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close watch on the ice coffin, secretly wary. Yin Changsheng's sudden halt was suspicious.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng's chilling voice echoed from within the ice coffin.</p><p>Not only was it hoarse, but it carried a stronger hint of madness and clear anger – extremely strange. He was incredibly weary and enraged by Qin Sang's relentless resistance.</p><p>“I never thought anyone in this world could force me to unleash my Hanging Sword Pavilion!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng's tone turned icy.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, an ominous feeling rising in her heart. Tong Lingyu clearly didn't understand her master well enough!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The cold mist in the ice coffin violently churned, Yin Changsheng's figure flickering, seeming to rise from the coffin.</p><p>Simultaneously, a white light slowly ascended from the ice coffin.</p><p>Within the white light was an exquisitely ornate nine-story pavilion – Yin Changsheng's spirit weapon, the Hanging Sword Pavilion!</p><p>The pavilion was completely translucent, as if carved from a single piece of black ice, each carving incredibly intricate. All nine stories were hollow, lacking walls, supported only by four pillars.</p><p>In the center of each story hung a sword.</p><p>The swords, like the pavilion, were carved from black ice, similar in size and shape, but each bore different carvings and characters – ancient scripts rarely seen.</p><p>Nine stories, nine hanging swords.</p><p>That’s how the Hanging Sword Pavilion got its name.</p><p>Upon seeing the Hanging Sword Pavilion, Qin Sang's face changed drastically, truly sensing the danger to her life.</p><p>Another magical treasure?</p>
