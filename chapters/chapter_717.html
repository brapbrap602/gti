<h1>Chapter 709: Escape</h1><p>The power of the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and the Sword Qi Thunderclap could not be concealed.</p><p>Qin Sang feared being noticed by the great demon, so he submerged into the ocean depths.  He initially held back, only unleashing his full speed as he neared his target.</p><p>The Jiao dragon roared, thunder echoed.</p><p>A dual-toned silver-red light streaked across the sea's surface.</p><p>Qin Sang's movement was immediately detected.</p><p>The great demon turned, its blood-red eyes fixated on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw the demon's true form. Its body was extraordinarily thick, and if not for half of it being destroyed by the cold flames, it would have rivaled the Jiao dragon. However, it was clearly a fish-like creature.</p><p>Its head was disfigured, but one could just barely make out a human face, with features strikingly similar to a human, an unsettling sight.</p><p>"It's a Human-Faced Porpoise,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered. Under the Human-Faced Porpoise's bloodshot gaze, a chill ran down his spine, though he was somewhat relieved.</p><p>The Human-Faced Porpoise had a long body but lacked Jiao dragon bloodline; it was a sea beast.</p><p>The good news was that this Human-Faced Porpoise's cultivation was not as terrifying as he had imagined—it wasn't at the peak of the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The Human-Faced Porpoise possessed extraordinary water-based abilities, particularly potent in the vast ocean.</p><p>A Core Formation peak Human-Faced Porpoise would be extremely challenging even for a Nascent Soul master.  Even wounded, Qin Sang had to proceed cautiously.</p><p>This Human-Faced Porpoise was evidently highly intelligent. Seeing Qin Sang pursuing it, the killing intent in its bloodshot eyes was terrifying, ferociously violent, yet it made the right choice, immediately sinking towards the ocean floor.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang reappeared above the sea, gazing down at the dark shadow in the water. He flicked out a black tongue of fire, and hissed, "Go!"</p><p>'Hiss… hiss…'</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was unaffected by seawater, moving freely within it, rapidly closing in on the Human-Faced Porpoise.</p><p>Sensing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's aura, the Human-Faced Porpoise, having already suffered at the hands of the cold flames, showed deep fear. Its body convulsed, and with a 'boom', a spray of water erupted as the creature was forced to leap out of the water.</p><p>Simultaneously, two dark figures, heavy with corpse energy, burst through the waves, flanking the Human-Faced Porpoise at incredible speed.</p><p>Instantly, the Human-Faced Porpoise lurched, creating a huge wave, and charged head-on, with its flesh and blood, at one of the flying night-rakshas.</p><p>The Human-Faced Porpoise's judgment was impeccable; it chose the weakest one.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Human-Faced Porpoise collided with the flying night-rakshas, sending the creature flying and crashing back into the sea. The Human-Faced Porpoise suffered deep lacerations, with corpse energy clinging to the wounds like a leech, seeping into its body.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>This beast could withstand the attacks of two flying night-rakshas and even knock one away—was its injury not as severe as it appeared?</p><p>Qin Sang quickly used his spiritual sense to check on the flying night-rakshas.</p><p>Soul-inducing grass was rare here; refining new flying night-rakshas would be difficult. If killing the Human-Faced Porpoise failed, and he lost another flying night-rakshas, it would break his heart.</p><p>Fortunately, the flying night-rakshas only suffered from corpse energy shock; they weren't physically harmed.</p><p>After knocking away a flying night-rakshas, the Human-Faced Porpoise let out a whale-like bellow. Its mouth opened, and a white mist rapidly formed, spinning and flying out.</p><p>A clicking sound echoed within the mist, which ultimately transformed into a cloud of ice fog.</p><p>The ice fog descended, as the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was catching up, but it was blocked by the ice fog, unable to penetrate easily.</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>This Human-Faced Porpoise had mastered ice-type abilities!</p><p>No wonder it looked so battered but wasn't as weak as he'd thought. Its mastery of ice abilities would make it far more resistant to cold flames than other demons.</p><p>Of course, even with its abilities, the Human-Faced Porpoise was severely injured. With enough time, Qin Sang believed he could kill it, but a quick victory, as he'd initially hoped for, was now impossible.</p><p>Hunting demons in the depths of the Demon Sea meant facing such dilemmas; whether to continue the fight was a judgment call.</p><p>As Qin Sang weighed his options, he heard a bird's call and looked up sharply.</p><p>The bird's call came from afar, yet its penetrating power was unmatched.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the instant the bird's call reached them, the Human-Faced Porpoise turned its head in that direction, its expression unusually serious, seemingly fearful of the sound's source.</p><p>"Another demon at the peak of the Yao Dan stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, a bitter taste on her lips.  She'd heard tales of the dense demon population in the Qian Yao Sea, but now she was experiencing it firsthand. Another beast had been alerted and was rapidly approaching.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept quickly around.</p><p>In the direction of the bird's call, a red cloud was hurtling towards her.  Similar situations were unfolding elsewhere: a dark cloud in the west, and restless waves in the northeast, where a long white figure was vaguely visible.</p><p>In all these places, demonic energy surged.</p><p>"The Cold Flame! They're drawn by the phenomenon of the Cold Flame's eruption!"</p><p>Qin Sang cried out, finally understanding the problem. The Cold Flame's eruption, its blue light shooting into the sky, must have been seen by distant demons, attracting them here. And these were surely not all; demons from the surrounding sea were likely on their way.</p><p>A cold sweat broke out on Qin Sang. She couldn't stay.  With a swift gesture, she put away the Nine Nether Infernal Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa, and fled.</p><p>The man-faced porpoise watched Qin Sang's back, hesitated, the ferocity in its bloodshot eyes gradually fading. It didn't pursue, but slowly sank towards the seabed.</p><p>East, northeast, west…</p><p>Demons were approaching from three directions. Qin Sang could only flee south, passing by the Cold Flame in her haste. She glanced at it.</p><p>The island was completely transformed. The central hill had become a deep crater, as if blown open from the middle. The cave was gone, leaving only a flickering blue Cold Flame.</p><p>Up close, its beauty was even more captivating.</p><p>Feeling the Cold Flame's aura, Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Such a powerful flame, yet she could only admire it from afar. She had thought it would remain hidden, allowing her time to figure out a way to obtain it. Now, with so many demons attracted, she wondered if any possessed the ability to subdue it—and whether any were of a rare, powerful species.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless; there was nothing she could do. Her priority was escape; she couldn't become trapped in a demon siege.</p><p>Remembering the map given to them by the short, stout cultivator, she realized the southern route would lead her back to the shipping lanes.  Trusting the map was her only option. Qin Sang flew south, maintaining constant vigilance, ready to evade any demons she encountered.</p>
