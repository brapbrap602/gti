<h1>Chapter 1359: The Grand Ceremony</h1><p>On the peak of the main mountain, a clear spring flowed.</p><p>Above the clouds, on the celestial platform, fragrant aromas wafted, auspicious colors filled the air.</p><p>Golden tables and jade platters held a hundred flavors of delicacies, immortal fruits and fine wines.</p><p>The many Nascent Soul cultivators were led to the celestial platform, exchanging congratulations.</p><p>Qin Sang had given instructions beforehand, and Mu Yifeng was also brought to the platform, given a seat.</p><p>Surrounded by Nascent Soul cultivators, Mu Yifeng answered every question, neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p>Dongyang Bo quietly left, surprising everyone.</p><p>Seeing the Qingyang Sect's attitude toward Mu Yifeng, the other Nascent Soul cultivators realized there must be some connection between them.  Considering Qin Sang, they didn't delve deeper, putting aside their various thoughts.</p><p>Jing Yu, tirelessly, personally greeted the guests for Qin Sang.</p><p>Only the main seat remained empty.</p><p>Soon, the Tongyou Demon Lord arrived in person, and the Nascent Soul cultivators, surprised, rose to greet him.</p><p>As time passed, more and more cultivators from the Qingyang Sect arrived.</p><p>The foot of the main peak was teeming with people, regardless of cultivation level, all treated to spiritual fruits and fine wine, drawing praise.</p><p>The auspicious time arrived.</p><p>The bell tolled again, one chime after another, continuously. The deep bell sound echoed from Qingyang Sect.</p><p>For a moment, heaven and earth were silent, the void clear, only the lingering bell sound remained.</p><p>Below the main peak, ten thousand cultivators fell silent, looking up.</p><p>On the celestial platform, the Nascent Soul cultivators also fell silent, turning their gazes to Jing Yu.</p><p>Jing Yu walked to the side of the main seat, looked around, his true essence surged, his voice overpowering the bell, "We respectfully invite the Qingyang Sect Master, Qin Sang!"</p><p>A slight stir ran through the crowd, which quickly quieted down.</p><p>The celestial platform trembled.</p><p>From the inner sanctum, a cloud bridge suddenly extended, reaching directly to the main peak's celestial platform.</p><p>The next moment, everyone felt a flash before their eyes, and a figure appeared on the cloud bridge.</p><p>This person, handsome as a youth, wore a simple light blue Daoist robe, his demeanor calm, smiling at the crowd – it was Qin Sang.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators on the celestial platform bowed from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and walked towards the celestial platform.</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Yu Fu and others had arrived at the main peak at some point.</p><p>All the disciples of the Qingyang Sect gathered, and Shangguan Lifeng also came down the mountain slightly.</p><p>Among them were Golden Core cultivators Li Yu Fu, Shangguan Lifeng, Mei Gu, Zhao Ying, and Tan Yi En.</p><p>Also present were Chi Lei, Old Monkey, White Crane, and White Cat,  妖丹期妖兽 brought to bolster the appearance.</p><p>The disciples ascended slightly, waiting below the celestial platform, looking up at the cloud bridge, their expressions fervent and proud.</p><p>Qin Sang, eyes straight ahead, walked serenely amidst the ringing bells.</p><p>From him, a faint fluctuation seemed to brew.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators first noticed Qin Sang's little trick, their smiles deepening.</p><p>But as Qin Sang drew closer, the smiles faded from some faces.</p><p>That fluctuation was sword intent. Qin Sang had become a sword, his every step strengthening his sword intent.</p><p>This sword intent represented Qin Sang's understanding of the sword path, of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, and the *Seven Souls Killing Formation* – not through the external power of a spirit sword, but utterly pure.</p><p>The sword cultivators were the first to lose their smiles; they understood the astonishing attainment Qin Sang had achieved in the sword path.</p><p>In the past ten years, Qin Sang had refined a Corpse Flower Blood Jasper, greatly increasing his cultivation.</p><p>More importantly, he had profound insights into his cultivation techniques, especially in the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*, accumulating and breaking through to mastery of the sword array!</p><p>Now, even using only a high-grade Jin Chen Sword to deploy the sword array, its power surpassed that of his previous Cloud Touring Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered holding the grand ceremony after breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, to make a stunning splash.</p><p>But he wasn't sure how long that would take.</p><p>Moreover, he would need to focus on closed cultivation afterward, without the energy to manage external matters.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect's reputation was already well-known; further delay was pointless.</p><p>In any case, his attainment in the *Seven Souls Killing Formation* alone would make anyone dare not underestimate him.</p><p>The sword intent emanating from him, a manifestation of the *Seven Souls Killing Formation*, caused the Nascent Soul cultivators on the celestial platform to widen their eyes one by one.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang descended the cloud bridge and reached the celestial platform, only the Tongyou Demon Lord, Lu Boyuan, and a few others could maintain their composure.</p><p>But in their eyes, a hint of apprehension appeared.</p><p>If before, Qin Sang's great reputation was largely due to the Demon Banner Demon Fire and Cloud Touring Sword, etc.,</p><p>Now, they truly acknowledged Qin Sang!</p><p>The remaining Nascent Soul cultivators were solemn, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p>If Qin Sang drew his sword, they had no confidence in being able to withstand it!</p><p>The bell tolled eighty-one times and ceased, Qin Sang reaching the peak of the celestial platform.</p><p>He looked up at the heavens, his expression unchanged, yet his eyes held a hint of remembrance.</p><p>Qingzhu, Yunyouzi, Jixin Daoist, Mingyue…</p><p>One familiar face after another flashed through his mind.</p><p>The carefree days at Qingyang Temple, the arduous journeys with Yunyouzi, the final strokes of Qingzhu and Taohua…  Each moment, each event, remains vividly in memory.</p><p>Finally, I have reached this point, fulfilling my late friend's wishes.  At the same time, I will leave my indelible mark on this world!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Yunyouzi's spirit, a flash of brilliance in her eyes. The sword intent, honed to its peak, erupted!</p><p>Amidst countless gasps, a phantom sword shadow separated from her body, slicing towards the void!</p><p>In an instant, the wind and clouds changed, the void transforming into a sword array.  Countless sword lights danced, their brilliance shifting, ever-changing, mysterious and unpredictable, seeming to evolve into a chaotic sword domain.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators stood solemnly, their eyes fixed on the array.</p><p>Lower-level cultivators in the valley below could only shield their eyes, the sword light too intense, bringing tears to their eyes.</p><p>When the array's changes reached their peak, it abruptly shifted from motion to stillness. The sword lights retracted, leaving only three ancient characters: Qingyang Temple!</p><p>The characters, condensed from sword light, descended slowly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>One side of the main peak's cliff face was sheared flat. The mountain remained unshaken, no dust arose, yet the three characters were forever etched there!</p><p>Li Yu Fu, his eyes filled with emotion, led his disciples in prostration, “Greetings, Temple Master!”</p><p>Then,</p><p>Jing Yu bowed, “Congratulations, Temple Master Qin, on the founding of your temple!”</p><p>All the Yuan Ying cultivators offered their congratulations.</p><p>Ten thousand cultivators in the valley below echoed the congratulations:</p><p>“Congratulations, Temple Master Qin, on the founding of your temple!”</p><p>…</p><p>“I, Qin, following the wishes of my predecessors, establish Qingyang Temple.  I am unworthy of this task and deeply humbled… Thank you, fellow cultivators, for your presence at this ceremony!”</p><p>Qin Sang turned, returning their greetings, then her gaze fell upon Li Yu Fu and the others.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators knew the ceremony was far from over. They savored the sword intent Qin Sang had just displayed, patiently observing.</p><p>In the cultivation world, founding a temple involved many intricacies.  A thorough ceremony would take several more hours.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to get bogged down in excessive formalities, so after instructing her disciples and having them pay their respects to the spirit tablets of Yunyouzi and Qingzhu, the ceremony neared its end.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang flicked her sleeve, and eighty-one Beast King banners flew out.</p><p>“Thank you, Temple Master, for the gift!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others received the banners, publicly demonstrating the banner array's transformations.</p><p>Instantly, black smoke billowed below the altar, the souls of cloud beasts roared, a soul-stirring sight.</p><p>It was fortunate that cloud beast souls could be used instead of demonic beasts; otherwise, it would have been difficult to make this public.</p><p>The banner array's transformations were limitless.  Though only a demonstration, its power was not fully shown, yet it still drew the attention of the Yuan Ying cultivators.</p>
