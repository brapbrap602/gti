<h1>Chapter 2096: Interception</h1><p>Qingyang Temple's Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang roused from his meditative trance. With a flick of his sleeve, he sent forth a yellow talisman. The talisman spontaneously ignited before him, and Si Lu's voice emerged from the flames, recounting the events unfolding in the Demon Sea.</p><p>As the talisman's fire gradually dimmed, a look of surprise and bewilderment crossed Qin Sang's face.</p><p>He hadn't anticipated the Changyou Clan Chief's breakthrough at this juncture. All indications suggested that the Changyou Clan Chief wasn't exceptionally gifted, having only reached the late stage due to the benefits of the Azure Spirit Energy.</p><p>With such talent, without profound accumulation or a heaven-defying opportunity, breaking through to the second level of the Void Realm would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>During the last struggle for the Azure Spirit Energy, the Changyou Clan Chief hadn't displayed any signs of an impending breakthrough. Yet, he had seemingly overcome this hurdle in less than a century.</p><p>Nevertheless, the world was unpredictable, and unexpected events were commonplace. Perhaps the Changyou Clan Chief had indeed stumbled upon some fortuitous encounter or experienced a sudden epiphany.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Chief's unexpected breakthrough presented Qin Sang with a considerable predicament.</p><p>Previously, he hadn't considered the Changyou Clan a threat. Due to his apprehension towards the Zhuyan Clan, and his intention to use the Changyou Clan as a whetstone to hone the Storm Realm, he had refrained from taking action against them.</p><p>His original plan was to cultivate a strength that would deter the Zhuyan Clan—specifically, the Thunder Altar—before addressing the Changyou Clan issue.  Hence, upon his return, he had remained patient, focusing solely on constructing the altar.</p><p>With the Changyou Clan Chief's breakthrough and subsequent massacre of the demon races, continued forbearance was no longer an option.</p><p>Even if the deaths of the Flood Dragon King and other demons were inconsequential, once the Changyou Clan exterminated the demon races, they would undoubtedly launch a full-scale invasion of the Middle Continent. He couldn't allow that to happen.</p><p>However, if he intervened, a clash between two Void Refinement experts would likely attract the attention of the Zhuyan Clan. With the Thunder Altar incomplete, the situation could spiral out of his control.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew grave as he mentally ran through the various possible scenarios, contemplating his course of action should the worst come to pass.</p><p>The good news was that Su Nu had returned and discovered a refuge. However, this refuge was far from ideal, being a landmass situated within the Tide of Mists.</p><p>The Foreign Tribes were accustomed to dealing with mist, and the Jiaojiao Clan, originating from Ji Hong, was one of the most adept at manipulating it.  Ji Hong had cultivated various spirit plants there, and by leveraging their unique properties, he had carved out a habitable area for cultivators. However, the space was limited, accommodating only a small number.</p><p>Qin Sang could at best bring his closest confidantes, making it a last resort.</p><p>What if he threw caution to the wind and simply eliminated the Changyou Clan Chief?</p><p>The Changyou Clan Chief had only recently broken through; his cultivation might not even be stable. He alone would suffice.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Chief, despite possessing Void Refinement stage strength, was wantonly slaughtering juniors in the Storm Realm. If he, Qin Sang, were to intervene and slay the Chief, even if it meant killing him in battle, no one could fault him.</p><p>Such a course of action might be feasible within the Foreign Tribes. However, facing him, an outsider, the Zhuyan Clan might not be so reasonable.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the still-smoldering talisman fire, and his expression shifted subtly.</p><p>"Si Lu, the Si You Clan, the Zhuyan Clan…"</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he pondered the connections between them, a plan forming in his mind.  He flicked his finger, sending a thread of intent into the talisman fire.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang activated another talisman, transmitting a message to Su Nu in the North Sea. When they encountered the Changyou Clan Chief, Su Nu could also make her move.</p><p>Further contemplation was futile. Having made these arrangements, Qin Sang immediately rose, soared into the sky, and sped away on his flying light.</p><p>…</p><p>North Sea.</p><p>Su Nu, currently assisting the Xuan Tian Palace in constructing their altar, received the talisman transmission. A contemplative expression crossed her face, and then she issued a few commands through the Xuan Tian Palace before flying alone towards the North Star Realm.</p><p>She knew that the main force of the Changyou Clan was about to launch a surprise attack on the North Star Realm. General Minshan and several clan elders were stationed there. Capturing them would be akin to seizing the Changyou Clan's vital point.</p><p>…</p><p>Canglang Sea.</p><p>Si Lu perceived Qin Sang's intent, nodded slightly, and withdrew the talisman.</p><p>"Senior, what did the Master say?" Gui Hou inquired.</p><p>"He told us to remain calm and act according to the circumstances."</p><p>Si Lu knew that Qin Sang certainly didn't want these demon soldiers to be completely annihilated.  After a moment's thought, a crimson light shot out from his brow, transforming into a small, exquisitely formed crimson-feathered demon bird, one of his four companion beasts.</p><p>His lips moved slightly as he silently recited an incantation. The crimson light on the demon bird gradually subsided, and finally, its entire body became transparent, merging with the void, imperceptible to the naked eye, its aura concealed to the extreme.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Si Lu opened a slight gap in the circular mirror, and the crimson-feathered demon bird flapped its wings, leaving the island and flying towards the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>His main body remained on the island, eyes slightly closed, sensing the outside situation through his companion beast.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Chief was hunting demon cultivators from south to north, passing by the west side of the spirit island. The crimson-feathered demon bird maintained a moderate speed, keeping its distance from the battlefield and sensing the fluctuations emanating from it.</p><p>Si Lu sensed the auras of demon cultivators rapidly dissipating.  Scattered as they were, the demon forces were no match for the Changyou Clan Chief. He could imagine the gruesome scene, almost smelling the blood carried by the sea breeze.</p><p>Soon, this contingent of demon cultivators was completely wiped out, leaving no survivors. The Changyou Clan Chief continued his advance.  He seemed intent on hunting down every last demon cultivator, so his speed wasn't particularly fast. The crimson-feathered demon bird could easily keep up.</p><p>As the number of demon cultivators slain by Min Zhuo increased, the Flood Dragon King and the Phoenix Queen both sensed something amiss.</p><p>They had completely lost contact with the Golden Toad King.  As time passed, an atmosphere of unease enveloped the Canglang Sea. Both the Flood Dragon King and the Phoenix Queen grew cautious and began to consolidate their forces, moving towards each other.</p><p>With still no news of the Golden Toad King, even the most foolish could guess that he had met with misfortune.</p><p>Initially, they speculated that there might be Changyou Clan experts hiding in the Canglang Sea, waiting to strike, and the previous retreat was a ploy to lull them into a false sense of security.</p><p>If several Changyou Clan elders, or even the Clan Chief himself, were to attack together, it wasn't impossible for them to trap and kill the Golden Toad King.</p><p>However, they gradually dismissed this conjecture, as there had been no sign of the Golden Toad King's remnants. Even with reinforcements from the Changyou Clan's forces in the North Sea, they couldn't have completely annihilated the Golden Toad King's contingent; there would surely be survivors.</p><p>Unless...the enemy's strength was beyond their comprehension!</p><p>The unknown was the greatest fear. The Flood Dragon King and the Phoenix Queen grew increasingly restless.  They ordered their subordinates to conceal their auras, and the Canglang Sea at night became a dangerous abyss, though they knew not where the danger truly lay.</p><p>Could it be that a powerful ferocious beast was roaming about, and the Golden Toad King had the misfortune of encountering it? Or had they encountered a Mistfall, and all the demon cultivators were swept away?</p><p>Just then, Min Zhuo had discovered the Phoenix Queen's contingent.</p><p>He deliberately avoided provoking the Flood Dragon Clan, expending considerable effort to eliminate the Golden Toad King's remnants before continuing his search for the Phoenix Queen's forces.</p><p>As expected, Zai Zhen followed behind, seemingly unaware of his intentions, and hadn't demanded that he attack the Flood Dragon Clan.</p><p>‘Splash… splash…’</p><p>Waves rippled. The distance appeared calm.  The Phoenix Queen and the other demons employed the same tactic, concealing themselves well. Even if any residual aura remained, the sea breeze would quickly disperse it.</p><p>But in Min Zhuo's eyes, these auras were as conspicuous as stars in the sky, impossible to hide.</p><p>His gaze swept across the sea surface, immediately locking onto a direction, and rapidly closing in.</p><p>Before long, the demon army came into view.</p><p>Anticipating danger, all the demon cultivators had been recalled by the Phoenix Queen, marching silently across the sea surface.</p><p>Unaware of the approaching enemy, they maintained their formation.  Above them soared colorful feathered spirit birds, resembling phoenixes, all of them Phoenix Clan experts, patrolling the skies. In critical moments, the Phoenix Queen trusted her own kin the most.</p><p>At the forefront of the army was an azure treasure ship, adorned with light gauze curtains, exquisitely crafted, its hull light and graceful, like a feather.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen stood at the bow, her brows furrowed, her expression incredibly grave.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light landed on the ship, and a charming young woman in palace attire hurried to the bow, bowing and saying, "Aunt, there's still no news of the Golden Toad King's remnants. What should we do now?"</p><p>Her tone was urgent; she too sensed the danger.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen remained silent. The longer the delay, the more unfavorable the situation became.  The Golden Toad King was most likely doomed.</p><p>The only good news now was that they and the Flood Dragon King's contingent hadn't been attacked yet. If they could safely rendezvous, they would retain at least seventy percent of their strength.</p><p>But what should they do next?</p><p>The situation had been so favorable, with them having retaken the entire Demon Sea and most of the Canglang Sea.  Without any warning, the situation had reversed, and they had become frightened birds without even seeing the enemy's face.</p><p>They would certainly have to abandon the Canglang Sea, but could they defend the Demon Sea with their remaining strength against this unknown enemy?</p><p>Would they have to flee back to the Middle Continent?</p><p>The Phoenix Queen had already prepared for the worst-case scenario. As she pondered, she suddenly sensed something amiss beneath the ship.</p><p>In the middle of the demon army, some cultivators suddenly realized that the sea surface beneath them was rising.  Looking left and right, they found themselves lifted above the surrounding water by several feet in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>Someone cried out.</p><p>The Phoenix Queen's treasure ship was also lifted by the seawater. Her expression changed dramatically.  Her lips parted slightly, and her voice boomed, echoing throughout the entire army.</p><p>"Form formation!"</p><p>Along with the Phoenix Queen's decree came a thunderous roar, originating from the seabed, exploding in the ears of all the demons, shaking heaven and earth!</p><p>All the demon cultivators looked towards the center in terror. There, the seawater bulged high,掀起滔天巨浪, sending demon cultivators flying, even lifting the Phoenix Queen's treasure ship high into the air, throwing the Phoenix Clan experts in the sky into disarray.</p><p>Endless seawater was thrown skyward, then crashed down from above. The giant wave nearly split the demon army in two.</p><p>"Dragon! Dragon!"</p><p>Some demon cultivators trembled, pointing at the giant wave with terrified faces.</p><p>Amidst the splashing water, they saw a terrifying silhouette – shining scales, sharp claws, a majestic dragon head and horns – clearly a giant dragon!</p><p>Not the pseudo-dragons of the Flood Dragon Clan, but a true dragon, exactly like those in legends!</p><p>The giant wave was merely the dragon's back, its latter half submerged, its length unknown. They had just happened to pass over the dragon, and as it surfaced, it capsized their army!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The dragon roared. The water surface behind the army suddenly split open, and a transparent shadow burst forth, revealing the dragon's tail.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Seawater was flung into the sky, transforming into torrential rain.</p><p>The dragon's tail whipped through the air, lashing out at the demons. Each demon cultivator could only see a portion of the tail. Even the largest demon cultivator felt utterly insignificant at this moment.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the Phoenix Queen's sharp cry rang out again.</p><p>"Form formation!"</p><p>In the distance, a sneer appeared on Min Zhuo's face. This water dragon was formed by his divine ability.  With the demon army's formation disrupted by the water dragon, how could they possibly be his match?</p><p>With a thought, the dragon's eyes gleamed fiercely, and it raised its claws, ready to strike the Phoenix Queen's treasure ship.</p><p>At this moment, experts from various clans were still gathered around the treasure ship. If Min Zhuo succeeded, the demon army would be leaderless.</p><p>Si Lu witnessed this scene through his companion beast.</p><p>Seeing this, Si Lu could no longer remain a bystander. The Flood Dragon King had brought almost thirty percent of the Demon Sea's demon experts, including all the experts from the Golden Toad Clan. Among the various clans, the most talented, and the ones Qin Sang valued most, were undoubtedly the Golden Toad, Phoenix, and Flood Dragon Clans.</p><p>If the Phoenix Queen's contingent was also annihilated, Qin Sang would have very few demon soldiers left.</p><p>Just as the giant dragon emerged from the water, the crimson-feathered demon bird had already flown to the periphery of the battlefield.</p><p>A crimson light appeared in the void, transforming into the small bird.  The bird raised a wing, its tip aimed at the dragon's brow, and a crimson feather shot out like an arrow released from a bowstring.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>On the chaotic battlefield, almost no one noticed this insignificant feather.</p><p>But Min Zhuo immediately became aware of it, his gaze narrowing slightly.  He thought, "Finally."</p><p>The dragon raised its head, facing the approaching crimson feather. Its mouth opened wide, spewing forth a "dragon's breath," which was actually a torrent of water.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The crimson feather and the dragon's breath collided with astonishing force, water and fire clashing, their colors spreading across the sky, each occupying half of the firmament.</p><p>The dragon's body trembled, and it was flung back thousands of feet, its attack naturally disrupted. The demon cultivators narrowly escaped disaster.</p><p>"Who dares to obstruct me!"</p><p>Min Zhuo feigned surprise, stepping into the sky, his gaze burning as he stared at the crimson-feathered demon bird, and questioned in a deep voice.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why do you obstruct me?"</p><p>The crimson-feathered demon bird turned its gaze, its eyes deep. It opened its beak and spoke in a flat tone, "Fellow Daoist, with your esteemed status at the second level of the Void Realm, wantonly slaughtering juniors damages your reputation as an expert."</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted coldly.  "They are sworn enemies of my clan, with a blood feud against us. My slaying them is only right and proper!"</p><p>"You can kill, and others can kill you as well."</p><p>The crimson-feathered demon bird's tone remained uninflected. "However, whether you kill them or not is of no concern to me. I stumbled upon this matter by chance, and I only appeared to stop you because I was entrusted by another.  If you have any grievances, you might as well wait for the person in charge to arrive and settle them face to face."</p><p>Min Zhuo sneered repeatedly, secretly activating a secret technique to contact Zai Zhen.</p><p>"Brother Zai, what should we do now?"</p><p>Zai Zhen transmitted his voice from afar. "That demon bird is a companion beast.  This person should be that Si You Clan expert. I didn't expect him to be lured out so quickly. Brother Min, might as well comply with his wishes and delay him, waiting for that demon expert to arrive."</p><p>"Brother Zai, aren't you going to reveal yourself yet? Why not join forces to capture this person before the demon expert arrives?" Min Zhuo asked, puzzled.</p><p>"Hehe, the Si You Clan has four companion beasts each. Even if you kill this demon bird, it's only one companion beast.  Its main body is hidden somewhere," Zai Zhen explained. "Brother Min, don't be impatient. When the person in charge arrives, I'll tell you what to do."</p>
