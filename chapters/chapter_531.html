<h1>Chapter 524: Contact</h1><p>Repeated attempts at the Gangsha Condensation method, all the signs aligned with his previous refinement of the Flying Night Devil and Wu Shang's notes. Although the Gangsha Condensation hadn't yet succeeded, Qin Sang was certain that this secret method was feasible!</p><p>The reason for the continuous failures was the insufficient amount of Pure Yang罡!</p><p>Even if Shi Ying gave Qin Sang all the Pure Yang罡 she brought out each time, it wouldn't be enough for the Gangsha Condensation.</p><p>Moreover, Shi Ying didn't dare enter the mountain frequently, and Qin Sang couldn't wait indefinitely.</p><p>Firstly, the corpse Qi couldn't be suppressed forever. Secondly, Qin Sang discovered that the combination of Gang and Sha was extremely unstable. He suspected that once the secret method began, it couldn't be interrupted.</p><p>It seemed he had to infiltrate Divine罡 Peak himself.</p><p>The restriction he placed within Shi Ying's body would automatically dissipate once he left the Pure Yang Demonic Sect a certain distance, allowing Shi Ying to awaken.</p><p>During Qin Sang's time in the Pure Yang Demonic Sect, Shi Ying would remain asleep in the cave dwelling.</p><p>She had no friends, and Qin Sang would seal the cave dwelling's restrictions, indicating that the person inside was in secluded cultivation, so he wasn't afraid of anyone discovering Shi Ying's unusual state.</p><p>Shi Ying lay on the bed, the darkness between her eyebrows fading, sleeping soundly like a baby, oblivious to everything.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang opened Shi Ying's storage pouch, retrieving the Qingfu Coins, Void Thunder Talismans, and the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles. He left the other items untouched as compensation for Shi Ying.</p><p>Besides, those talismans couldn't be brought to Divine罡 Peak. He needed to focus on completing the secret method and wouldn't have time to protect them. Only the Void Thunder Talismans, being of magic treasure quality, could withstand the chaotic Yuan Qi on Divine罡 Peak.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang gently crushed a Qingfu Coin.</p><p>The coin shattered, then flashed with light, flowing like liquid in Qin Sang's palm and transforming into a drop of insect blood. A faint image of a young Qingfu insect appeared above the blood.</p><p>The image let out a barely audible chirp, then shattered with a ‘boom,’ along with the remnants of the coin, turning into specks of stardust that dissipated into the void.</p><p>At this time, Yun Youzi, holding the mother Qingfu Coin, had entered Boundless Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was informing Yun Youzi that he could proceed.</p><p>Pure Yang Demonic Sect disciples generally cultivated the Pure Yang Demonic Fire technique. Unlike Foundation Establishment cultivators like Shi Ying, they had a certain resistance to the chaotic Yuan Qi on Divine罡 Peak. Powerful cultivators would choose to cultivate on the peak, constantly absorbing the Pure Yang罡.</p><p>Especially the Pure Yang Demonic Sect's Core Formation experts; they could remain on Divine罡 Peak indefinitely without being affected.</p><p>Currently, there were quite a few experts on the peak.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted Yun Youzi to cause some chaos, the bigger the better, preferably drawing all the late Foundation Establishment and Core Formation experts of the Pure Yang Demonic Sect to Boundless Valley.</p><p>This would allow him to sneak into the mountain amidst the confusion, minimizing the chance of being discovered.</p><p>As for the Gold Core expert whose whereabouts were unknown, Qin Sang didn't think he could lure him away.</p><p>Yun Youzi was right. Those who reached Gold Core were all cunning and shrewd. With the Pure Yang Demonic Sect's experts currently outside, the sect was vulnerable, and this person wouldn't easily leave.</p><p>If they went too far and aroused his suspicion, it would backfire.</p><p>Qin Sang believed Yun Youzi knew his limits.</p><p>He was prepared to steal Pure Yang罡 right under the nose of a Gold Core expert. This required him to be precise in completing the secret method, without a single mistake, and he could only proceed gradually, not rushing the process.</p><p>Having crushed the Qingfu Coin, all that remained was to wait for news.</p><p>Qin Sang tucked the Void Thunder Talismans and Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottles into his robes, glanced back at the sleeping Shi Ying, then activated Shi Ying's soul mark within his Yuan Shen to open the cave's restriction.</p><p>Concealing his form, he slipped out of the cave dwelling, restored the restriction, and turned to gaze at the vast inner sect of the Pure Yang Demonic Sect.</p><p>Among the mountains, he occasionally saw the figures of Pure Yang Demonic Sect disciples flying on their magical tools, most of them Qi Refining disciples, traveling between Divine罡 Peak and their own cave dwellings.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed unique Qi concealment techniques. Within the Pure Yang Demonic Sect, perhaps only the Gold Core expert could detect him. As for the other Core Formation cultivators, Qin Sang was confident he could evade their perception.</p><p>Unless he was incredibly unlucky, there was little chance of being discovered.</p><p>With a light leap, Qin Sang vanished into the dark crevices between the rocks, silently leaving the cliff, then descended into the jungle at the foot of the mountain, discreetly making his way through the forest.</p><p>Strangely, he wasn't heading towards Divine罡 Peak but in the opposite direction, towards the outer perimeter of the inner and outer sects.</p><p>After crossing more than ten mountains, Qin Sang appeared on the bank of a river valley.</p><p>Ancient trees towered on both sides of the valley. Qin Sang hid beneath the shadow of a tree, looking up towards the end of the valley.</p><p>At the valley's exit, two massive boulders jutted out from the mountains on either side, standing like gatekeepers.</p><p>A grey-robed elder sat cross-legged on the left boulder, his white hair and aged appearance belying his late Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>This elder was one of the Pure Yang Demonic Sect's stewards. Advanced in age, with little hope of further cultivation advancement, he remained in the sect to manage affairs. His current duty was to oversee patrol teams throughout the sect.</p><p>Entering or leaving the inner sect required passing the elder's or the patrol team's inspection.</p><p>Every so often, a team of patrolling disciples would fly in from the horizon, salute the elder from afar, and then depart.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the time, then looked at the elder sitting still as a pine tree. He then vanished into the forest, finding a hidden spot to conceal himself, his figure perfectly blended with the shadows as he waited patiently.</p><p>A day and a night quickly passed.</p><p>Apart from disciples entering the inner sect and the patrolling teams, nothing unusual occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently waited for another entire day.</p><p>Still the same.</p><p>On the morning of the third day.</p><p>A cold morning breeze blew through the forest, rousing Qin Sang from his meditation.</p><p>Looking at the seemingly normal Pure Yang Demonic Sect, Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>If he delayed too long, he risked losing control of the corpse Qi. If something happened to Yun Youzi, he would have to risk entering Divine罡 Peak.</p><p>"Four days remaining..."</p><p>Qin Sang examined his inner state, sensing his physical condition and calculating the time limit.</p><p>If he couldn't lure away the Pure Yang Demonic Sect's experts, he might have to hide in a corner at the foot of the mountain, secretly absorbing Pure Yang罡, unsure if the Pure Yang罡 at the foot of the mountain was as pure.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering, he suddenly heard a sharp whooshing sound from the end of the river valley.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He abruptly stood up, silently emerging from the shadows, staring towards the valley. A streak of fire rapidly approached, moving at incredible speed.</p><p>"Halt! Who goes there!"</p><p>The elder on the boulder suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within them as he roared.</p><p>"Senior Brother Chai, it's me!"</p><p>The streak of light instantly reached the elder, the fire dissipating to reveal a square-faced middle-aged man, his face filled with panic.</p>
