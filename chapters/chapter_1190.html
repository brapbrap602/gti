<h1>Chapter 1182: The Battle Begins</h1><p>Chapter 1182: The Battle Begins</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you can actually see through Chan Ling’s concealment technique!”</p><p>Jing Lin’s eyes changed.</p><p>Chan Ling Dao Ren was quite notorious. Anyone who fought him found it extremely difficult.  This person was incredibly cunning, always avoiding even masters like the Old Daoist Zhen Yi.</p><p>Those weaker than Chan Ling Dao Ren couldn't even fight back; Chan Ling Dao Ren could retreat at any time, ensuring his invincibility.</p><p>A newly transformed demon cultivator could easily see through Chan Ling's location!</p><p>It wasn't a coincidence; judging from the Moonlit Demon King's earlier tone, Chan Ling was completely exposed before him.</p><p>Jing Lin recalled their disappointment when he and Si Di learned about their helper's background. Now they realized they had underestimated the Moonlit Demon King.</p><p>“My abilities happen to counter this concealment method.”</p><p>Qin Sang offered a brief explanation.</p><p>Jing Lin, initially panicked, now beamed with excitement, “That old thief Chan Ling has finally met his match!”</p><p>He immediately sent a message to Si Di, informing him of the situation.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, how much do you know about Chan Ling?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm.</p><p>Even if Chan Ling's concealment technique was countered, he was still a formidable Nascent Soul Stage cultivator.</p><p>Three against three, maintaining the Cold Bell Formation wouldn't be difficult. The challenge was forcing them back or defeating them.  A prolonged fight would be uncertain!</p><p>The previously planned tactics were clearly useless.</p><p>With Chan Ling and Old Devil Pei manipulating the Dark Crystal Pagoda to support him, a surprise attack was almost impossible.</p><p>If they had a Nascent Soul cultivator to control the Cold Bell Formation, it might help. But with just a Golden Core cultivator, avoiding detection was already a huge struggle; they couldn't expect any assistance.</p><p>“We’ve fought the Abyss for so long, we know something about their Nascent Soul cultivators.  Besides that mysterious treasure, Chan Ling hasn't displayed any other powerful abilities. However, he is still a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator…”</p><p>Jing Lin's joy subsided.  Nascent Soul cultivators couldn’t be underestimated; no one knew if Chan Ling had hidden trump cards.  More often than not, Chan Ling would calmly retreat before things turned critical.</p><p>“So, Fellow Daoist, you’re not entirely confident? It seems we can either abandon the plan, stick to our positions and wait for reinforcements, or devise another strategy.”</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>Jing Lin was reluctant, “We’ve finally got a helper who counters Chan Ling, and we have the upper hand.  Giving up now would be a shame!”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang said, “Chan Ling and Old Devil Tan are trying to surround Si Di. No matter who we attack, the other one and the Dark Crystal Pagoda will immediately provide support.  Only Old Devil Pei, who controls the Dark Crystal Pagoda, will be the last to react. But to use this against him, Si Di must act as bait, enduring the attacks of three Nascent Soul cultivators—it’s very risky…”</p><p>“The Abyss is always very protective of the Dark Crystal Pagoda. The operator can use the pagoda's power for protection, making it difficult to break through. But Old Devil Pei doesn't know the Cold Bell Formation is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, so he’ll definitely cooperate with Chan Ling and Tan to hunt down Si Di. At the moment of attack, it will be Pei's most vulnerable moment. That's our chance.”</p><p>Jing Lin hesitated, “As Fellow Daoist said, Si Di’s situation is very dangerous. We need to ask for his consent.”</p><p>After a silent exchange.</p><p>A glimmer of joy flashed in Jing Lin’s eyes, “Si Di agrees to be the bait! He has recently learned a new ability that can handle this situation; it will be a surprise for the Abyss!”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that Si Di actually agreed.  He said solemnly, “We must not betray Si Di’s trust.  We must not fail in this assassination of Old Devil Pei!”</p><p>Jing Lin nodded, “We only have one chance. Once Old Devil Pei and the others react, it will be difficult to harm him again. My life-saving treasure is the Wind Summoning Bracelet…”</p><p>The two carefully discussed and planned the details, quickly finalizing their strategy.</p><p>As they were discussing, the Abyss army pressed forward without hesitation, charging towards the misty sea.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Three Dark Crystal Pagodas landed, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Black light radiated, forming three incredibly tall towers, arranged in a triangular formation in the middle of the battlefield, overlooking the cultivators and confronting the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>The three towers glowed, beams of black light filled the heavens, converging into halos that slowly descended, covering the Abyss cultivators in a faint film of light.</p><p>The Abyss cultivators roared in unison, their momentum terrifying.</p><p>Old Devil Tan flew into the air, leading the charge like a sharp blade. Old Devil Pei and Chan Ling were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The Abyss cultivators behind them charged forward while busily preparing.</p><p>The next moment, clusters of differently colored light erupted in the center of the battle array.</p><p>The Cui Yuan army’s formation was far more organized and disciplined than the Two Realms Alliance.  The myriad glowing orbs represented various enchantments, elemental spells, and magical artifacts; seemingly chaotic, they worked together with remarkable precision.</p><p>A massive energy surge erupted from the Cui Yuan ranks, coalescing into a gigantic protective dome that enveloped everyone, obscuring the幽晶塔 (Youjing Tower) energy field.</p><p>They advanced swiftly.</p><p>Tan Lao Mo scanned his surroundings, issuing commands. Beams of light shot from the formation, striking the ground ahead.  Enchantment runes materialized, the earth ripped open, spewing forth magma and thorny vines – but all these effects were quickly neutralized.</p><p>Clearly, the Two Realms cultivators had laid traps.</p><p>However, against enemies led by a Yuan Ying cultivator, such tactics proved largely ineffective.</p><p>Under Tan Lao Mo's direction, the Cui Yuan forces systematically cleared the traps.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The Youjing Tower unleashed streaks of black energy, solidifying in mid-air into massive, bladeless black swords.  These colossal weapons cleaved through the air, striking the cold mist ahead as the cultivators charged forward.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The swords sliced cleanly into the mist.  A terrifying shockwave rippled outward from the clash of opposing forces.  The earth trembled.</p><p>A clear gap appeared in the mist; where the blades passed, the fog thinned significantly, with more mist rushing in from the surroundings.</p><p>A rapid series of bells tolled from within the formation.</p><p>The Youjing Tower's power and the Cold Bell Formation were locked in a mutual struggle, each eroding the other.</p><p>In the central tower, the Golden Core cultivator controlling the array, face pale and teeth gritted, stubbornly held his ground, faithfully executing Jing Lin’s orders to maintain a defensive posture.</p><p>By now, the Cui Yuan army, through the thinning mist, could see the Two Realms cultivators, fully prepared for battle.</p><p>They were ready, poised for action the moment the enemy was spotted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A roar erupted from the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>Enemies meeting – hatred intensified!</p><p>Before the Cui Yuan cultivators even reached the mist, a blinding flash erupted.  Countless blades of light, swords, and elemental spells surged toward them, a torrential wave from the Two Realms ranks.</p><p>Even the Yuan Ying cultivator, Tan Lao Mo, didn’t take this lightly; he retreated cautiously.</p><p>Under his guidance, the Cui Yuan forces pushed their protective dome forward, layer upon layer, shielding them from the onslaught.</p>
