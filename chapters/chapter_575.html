Chapter 568: Fiends and a Transmitted Message


Master Zhenyi had long warned of the consequences of mutual destruction.  The Zu Yuan forces are overwhelming, and Ye Laomo is ambitious. Once the Tianxing Alliance falls, Xiaohan Domain's fate will soon follow.

The Xiaohan Domain Nascent Soul cultivators, upon hearing the command from the Red-haired Ancestor, quickly understood the stakes and decided to obey, turning to rescue their allies without even retrieving their magical treasures.

The grievances between the two domains can be settled later; right now, they must prevent Zu Yuan from annihilating the Tianxing Alliance.

At that moment, the Zu Yuan cultivators' assault finally crashed down upon the Tianxing Alliance.

A dark tide of demonic energy descended from the heavens, engulfing them.

Their hastily formed defenses were shattered in an instant.

Screams of agony tore through the air.

The once formidable Nascent Soul masters became lambs to the slaughter, submerged in the demonic tide, facing a demonic onslaught, their lives hanging in the balance.

After this massacre, it was uncertain how many would survive.

As for the Golden Core cultivators, probably none would remain.

‘Plop plop plop…’

The Xiaohan Domain reinforcements finally arrived, breaking through the demonic tide to rescue people.

In this great battle, Qin Sang and the Xiaohan Domain Golden Core cultivators were powerless to intervene, only able to watch.

Everyone was terrified, but seeing their own Nascent Soul cultivators respond promptly, directly killing the traitor and thwarting Zu Yuan's plot, they calmed down slightly, nervously monitoring the changing situation.

However, witnessing the Tianxing Alliance's plight, they couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding.

Qin Sang felt the most relieved. He alone knew that Chen Yan was a Nascent Soul cultivator, and even if several sides were defeated, escape should not be difficult given the exposure of the Wujimen sect leader's plot.

He strained his eyes, gazing outward, but saw only chaos in the Tianxing Alliance's ranks, making it nearly impossible to discern anything clearly.

He saw a Tianxing Alliance Nascent Soul cultivator, attempting to avoid the demonic tide, inadvertently leaving the protection of the Xiao Beicheng Star Formation, but before he could fly far, he vanished into thin air.

At the moment of his disappearance, an imperceptible ripple flashed from his body.

"Void Wind!"

Qin Sang was aghast.

This person was a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator, yet he was completely helpless against the Void Wind, instantly reduced to nothingness, leaving no corpse behind, not even his Nascent Soul escaped.

The power of the Void Wind was truly terrifying!

No wonder the Xiao Beicheng Star Formation nearly collapsed when it was merely grazed.

Then, Qin Sang saw a general wielding a war halberd burst from the demonic tide. He was covered in wounds, his abdomen bearing a gaping, bloody hole.

His halberd was also severely damaged, its top broken, its divine light dimmed.

He had clearly paid a great price to escape.

But as a glimmer of relief appeared on the general's face, countless fiends swarmed out of the demonic tide. They showed no fear of the general's attacks, ferociously and relentlessly tearing at his flesh.

Alongside the fiends, countless strange chains rose into the air, coiling around him like venomous snakes.

The general was overwhelmed, his face filled with despair.

The scene was gruesome and sickening.

Just as the general was about to be torn apart, he roared, striking his head at the Baihui acupoint. A green light flashed, and his Nascent Soul leaped out.

The Nascent Soul clutched a grayish-white, cracked mirror.  Its eyes were bright and alert.  Without hesitation, it shot towards the Xiaohan Domain side.

The moment the general's Nascent Soul appeared, the fiends seemed to see the most alluring delicacy. Their eyes filled with bloodlust, emitting chilling cries, they desperately pursued it.

A terrifying spectacle unfolded, sending a chill down Qin Sang's spine.

The general's Nascent Soul dodged repeatedly, but its maneuvering room grew smaller and smaller. Just as despair set in, a jade ruyi flew in, scattering green light, violently smashing the fiends and shattering the chains, opening a path for the general.

The one who had intervened was Daoist Chongyi.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist, for saving my life."

The general, still shaken, bowed in gratitude.

Daoist Chongyi nodded, continuing to use the jade ruyi to rescue others.

The general retreated to a corner to heal his wounds.

Normally, a lone, disembodied Nascent Soul would easily attract covetous eyes, but no one dared to defy convention and attack him.  They could only suppress their greed, stealing occasional glances.

One by one, the Tianxing Alliance Nascent Souls were rescued.


Each one was in a terrible state; hardly any were intact.

Unsurprisingly, those Golden Core cultivators were already dead, their souls devoured by the demons unleashed by the Abyss of Sin.  Their end must have been horrific.

Qin Sang silently rejoiced. Luckily, he and Yun Youzi had stumbled upon the Abyss of Sin's plot. Otherwise, they too would have suffered the same fate as the Tianxing League's Golden Core cultivators.

Beneath the six-armed demonic shadow…

A thin, elderly man in a black robe clutched a black stone sculpture.  The sculpture depicted the six-armed ancient demon, its eyes lifelike and extremely sinister.

"You two old geezers, you're lucky to be alive!"

The old man cursed, his expression sullen.  While the surprise attack had been successful, it fell far short of expectations.  Eliminating the opponents in these two regions permanently was impossible.

This once-in-a-millennium opportunity wouldn't come again.

The old man felt a deep regret.  After a moment's hesitation, he said in a low voice, "Enough! The ancient demon's shadow is fading.  We won't kill any more by lingering. Destroy their Little North Star Formation!"

The cultivators under the old man immediately obeyed.

The next moment, a thick demonic energy surged from the six-armed shadow, flowing into its six arms.  Then, the six arms rose in unison, like a heavy hammer, smashing down again on the Little North Star Formation.

'Bang! Bang! Bang!'

Blow after blow.

The six-armed shadow, recklessly consuming its essence, raged like a madman.

Each blow dimmed the North Star within the formation.

Finally, with the last blow, a corner of the star chart crumbled, the North Star fading to the extreme, on the verge of extinction.

The six-armed shadow, overexerted, swayed weakly, vulnerable.

The thin old man waved his arm: "Retreat!"

The Abyss of Sin's cultivators obeyed instantly, silently withdrawing, gathering their demons and chains.

Just as relief washed over the others at the Abyss of Sin's retreat, they noticed a change in the Little North Star Formation.

"No good!"

The Little North Star Formation's collapse was unstoppable.  The Red-haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Daoist were shocked, struggling desperately to stabilize the formation.  They cried out, "Quickly enter the Purple Palace!"

Without the protection of the Little North Star Formation within the celestial array, they were doomed.

Before retreating, Ye Laomo had dealt them one final blow.

The cultivators, without time to rest, frantically fueled their damaged spirit formation, scrambling to escape.  As the formation crumbled, cultivators were continuously annihilated by the void wind.

Dongyang Bo, alone and unable to hold back, protected Qin Sang and the others. Chen Yan could no longer hide her strength, revealing her Yuan Ying cultivation.

Finally reaching the edge of the celestial array, the Little North Star Formation was shattered, the cultivators scattered, swept away by the current.

Just as they were about to enter the Purple Palace, Qin Sang suddenly heard Jing Po'po's voice transmission.
