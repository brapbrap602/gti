<h1>Chapter 671: New Ability</h1><p>It can only refine magical artifacts.</p><p>Hui Wen was somewhat disappointed upon hearing this, but she didn't show it. "To be recommended by Senior Ran Luo, it must be extraordinary. Fellow Daoist, you are too modest. I am just an ordinary guest elder, my status is far below yours. After we arrive at Duyan Island, I hope Fellow Daoist will take care of me."</p><p>The journey was long, and after chatting for a while, the three lost interest in conversation. They each sat cross-legged in a corner of the carriage and entered meditative cultivation.</p><p>After traveling for more than ten days, Qin Sang noticed that the speed of the caravan had significantly increased. Upon inquiring, he learned that the caravan was selling goods to the local Wu tribes along the way.</p><p>It seems these merchants also understand the urgency of the situation and aren't prioritizing money over their lives.</p><p>Along the way, it turned out their worries were unfounded. Although some Wu tribe cultivators were observed watching the caravan, the situation never escalated.</p><p>In the latter half of the journey, many beast carts were emptied, allowing Qin Sang to occupy one by himself, finally enjoying some peace.</p><p>Ran Luo mentioned that they would arrive at Mount Wu the next day at noon. Qin Sang was filled with anticipation, wondering what the legendary Demon Sea would look like.</p><p>That night, as Qin Sang was meditating, he suddenly felt a stir in his heart and opened his eyes, looking at the insect basket at his waist.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle…’</p><p>A rustling sound came from the insect basket, a sound Qin Sang was all too familiar with - the sound of the fat silkworm.</p><p>It had been more than half a year since the fat silkworm had swallowed the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and spun its cocoon. It had been sleeping ever since, showing no signs of emerging.</p><p>During this time, his natal insect, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, had already progressed to the middle stage of its first transformation.</p><p>The fat silkworm was only in its second transformation, yet the time it took to metamorphose was exceptionally long, a rarity among spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang sometimes wondered if the fat silkworm couldn't withstand the medicinal power of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and had died inside the silver cocoon.</p><p>“It's gotten fatter again?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened the insect basket and pinched out the fat silkworm, a look of disgust on his face.</p><p>The expected transformation of the fat silkworm into a butterfly did not occur. It still had its plump, multicolored appearance. Apart from being larger than before it spun its cocoon, there seemed to be no other changes.</p><p>Its small eyes were also larger than before, at least visible to the naked eye. Similarly, the silkworm's cunning and lazy gaze was easier to discern.</p><p>The fat silkworm wriggled on Qin Sang's fingertip, rubbing against his hand ingratiatingly.</p><p>It was hungry and wanted to eat.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the silkworm's ability to express itself through its eyes had become stronger, indicating a significant increase in its intelligence during this transformation.</p><p>Glancing at the insect basket, the silver cocoon was gone. Qin Sang tossed out a few spirit fruits, and the fat silkworm, no longer picky, began to devour them.</p><p>This fellow might have been won over by the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, or perhaps it realized it couldn't escape and had resigned itself to its fate.</p><p>Seeing it eating with gusto, Qin Sang, as if performing a magic trick, produced a purple-red spirit fruit in his other hand and dangled it in front of the silkworm.</p><p>This was a poisonous fruit similar to the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, although its medicinal power was far inferior. After witnessing the fat silkworm's transformation after consuming the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, Qin Sang had an idea and bought many similar poisonous fruits in Pingbo Harbor.</p><p>He didn't know how to cultivate the fat silkworm and couldn't find any information on it either, so he could only experiment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the fat silkworm glanced lazily at the poisonous fruit, then went back to eating its food, seemingly indifferent to the difference between the poisonous fruit and the food in its mouth.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang took out all the poisonous fruits in his Qianjun Ring and tried them one by one.</p><p>Among them was a highly valuable poisonous flower that Qin Sang had planned to save until the fat silkworm reached the late stage of its second transformation, but none of them piqued the silkworm's interest.</p><p>“What does this thing like to eat?”</p><p>Qin Sang was very frustrated and had a headache.</p><p>Although the fat silkworm recognized Ya Gu as its master, it would take some time before Ya Gu could be awakened. Since the fat silkworm was now obedient, cultivating it would be a boon to his strength.</p><p>But the silkworm's picky appetite left Qin Sang at a loss.</p><p>After a while, having finished the spirit fruits, the fat silkworm was full, but it was clear that the fruits only sated its hunger and didn't contribute to its cultivation.</p><p>“After its transformation, I wonder if it has gained any new abilities?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>After the Sky-Eyed Butterfly hatched, Qin Sang discovered the secret of its camouflage.</p><p>Its wings had a pollen-like dust that allowed it to disguise itself as an ordinary butterfly when encountering enemies.</p><p>It gained the ability to conceal itself only after its second transformation.</p><p>Because it was only in its first transformation, Qin Sang could easily see through its disguise, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator might not be able to.</p><p>This also demonstrated the strength of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's camouflage and its proficiency in survival skills, which explained why even Qin Sang couldn't see through it after its second transformation.</p><p>The fat silkworm was not as good as the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Before its transformation, Qin Sang had used Nine Nether Demonic Fire to coerce the fat silkworm, and he found that the thing only knew how to eat, possessing no other abilities.  There should be some changes after its transformation.</p><p>Seemingly sensing the malicious intent in Qin Sang's gaze, the fat silkworm trembled but dared not run.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang used the Spirit Controlling Sect's insect control technique to communicate with the fat silkworm, instructing it to display its new ability. He also threatened it with Nine Nether Demonic Fire, saying he would roast and eat it if it was useless.</p><p>The fat silkworm's intelligence had indeed improved considerably, and it quickly understood Qin Sang's meaning.</p><p>It arched its fat body upwards, closed its eyes tightly, and the expression on its head suggested it was exerting great effort.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The multicolored light on the fat silkworm's body suddenly burst forth and rapidly spread outwards, covering a range so large that even Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang was caught off guard, but fortunately, he had previously set up a restrictive barrier in the carriage to prevent detection.</p><p>The halo released by the fat silkworm was also multicolored, like a rainbow, very beautiful. The multicolored halo rapidly expanded until it enveloped both Qin Sang and the fat silkworm, seemingly reaching its limit.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his hand and waved it within the multicolored halo, feeling nothing.</p><p>He released his divine sense to carefully investigate, but still found nothing unusual.</p><p>“An ability that took so long to manifest, it can't just be for show, can it?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then suddenly remembered something. He took out a purple jade bottle from his Qianjun Ring, held his breath, and carefully opened the stopper. A cloud of blue mist drifted out from the bottle, quickly becoming colorless and odorless.</p><p>This was a poisonous smoke that Qin Sang had obtained during the Foundation Establishment stage. It was extracted from the glands of a poisonous toad and could kill silently. Even a careless Foundation Establishment cultivator could be affected.</p><p>As soon as the poisonous smoke drifted out of the bottle, Qin Sang noticed the multicolored halo fluctuate. Then, the poisonous smoke was repelled, unable to penetrate the halo at all.</p><p>“It has the ability to repel poison, not bad.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, finally not disappointed.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, there were countless varieties of poisons. Some terrifying toxic lands were so dangerous that even Nascent Soul ancestors dared not venture into them. In addition, there were many poisonous beasts in the Demon Sea, forcing cultivators to avoid them for fear of being poisoned.</p><p>It was still unknown how many types of poison the multicolored halo could resist and what its limits were. This needed further investigation.</p><p>The fat silkworm's cultivation was still low, but it would definitely be of great use in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, determined to find a way to cultivate it as soon as possible.</p>
