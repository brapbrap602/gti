<h1></h1><p>Touching one small pagoda would cause a reaction in the other.  </p><p>Following this line of thought, Qin Sang attempted to communicate directly but found it impossible. However, the resonance between the two pagodas was instantaneous, with no delay.  </p><p>If two individuals were separated by thousands of miles, a signal sent from one would immediately alert the other. In specific situations, this could play a crucial role.  </p><p>For example, as a warning!  </p><p>Qin Sang no longer confined himself to his previous assumptions and boldly speculated further.  </p><p>Both the Profound Heaven Palace and the Pure Sea Sect had deep connections with Xiao Xiangzi.  </p><p>Let’s assume that Xiao Xiangzi deliberately left these two pagodas with these two sects.  </p><p>Various signs indicated that the fall of the Pure Sea Sect was related to a demonic entity. The sect had exhausted all its resources to repair an ancient seal and re-seal the demon. Could their duty have been to guard the demon’s seal?  </p><p>This duty was likely assigned by Xiao Xiangzi.  </p><p>Let’s go even further and assume that the Pure Sea Sect was founded by Xiao Xiangzi himself.  </p><p>If this were true, then when Xiao Xiangzi unified the Hidden Sun Realm and established the Profound Heaven Palace, was it also for a similar purpose—to prepare a contingency plan in case the demon broke free from its seal?  </p><p>This would explain the existence of the twin pagodas.  </p><p>If the seal showed signs of weakening, the Pure Sea Sect would immediately alert the Profound Heaven Palace through the Seven-Layered Pagoda, summoning allies and uniting the forces of both Buddhist and Daoist sects to suppress the demon.  </p><p>In fact, there might be more than just these two pagodas.  </p><p>If the demon broke free, it would face the combined might of the entire North Sea cultivation world.  </p><p>However, as time passed, human hearts changed, and things did not develop as Xiao Xiangzi had planned. Deviations occurred.  </p><p>The Pure Sea Sect fulfilled its duty.  </p><p>But the Profound Heaven Palace, driven by selfish desires, fell into internal strife. After enduring multiple calamities, it was no longer the original Profound Heaven Palace. Its ancient texts were lost, and it forgot the instructions of its founder and its own responsibilities, failing to appear as promised.  </p><p>Fortunately, the Pure Sea Sect managed to turn the tide, using Buddhist seals to repair the ancient seal. However, this resulted in the entire sect sacrificing themselves, leading to a tragic outcome.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked at the pagoda in his hand.  </p><p>These were all his speculations, most of which lacked evidence.  </p><p>Xiao Xiangzi’s temperament and whether he had the heart to protect all living beings remained unknown.  </p><p>Perhaps it was because Qin Sang had seen a similar scene in the Seven Slaughter Palace, where the Four Saints had sealed the Demon Lord at the cost of their lives, and their descendants had guarded the seal for generations, that he made such associations.  </p><p>Once he became a guest elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, he could slowly investigate within the Profound Heaven Palace and perhaps find some clues.  </p><p>After pondering for a long time and seeing no new developments, Qin Sang placed the twin pagodas back into his Thousand Jun Ring.  </p><p>...  </p><p>The Earth Tung Island was located in the western part of the Hidden Sun Realm.  </p><p>After leaving the Seventy-Two Springs of the Profound Heaven Palace, Qin Sang needed to head northwest.  </p><p>When he arrived at Earth Tung Island, Liuli and her companion had not yet arrived. He found the previously agreed-upon deserted island, entered it, and began to comprehend the *Seven Masters’ Buddha Seals*.  </p><p>After this period of time, Qin Sang had finally fully comprehended the first seal, the Auspicious Seal.  </p><p>At the center of the deserted island stood numerous stone peaks.  </p><p>The stone peaks were sparsely vegetated, with only a few patches of green in the crevices. These peaks were not particularly large, varying in height, with the thinnest resembling stone pillars.  </p><p>Qin Sang casually chose a larger stone peak, lightly tapped his foot, and flew to its front.  </p><p>Floating in mid-air, Qin Sang closed his eyes and remained motionless for a long time, as if sensing something.  </p><p>Suddenly, his eyes widened, a brilliant light flashing within them. He raised his arms, palms facing each other, and swiftly formed a Buddha seal.  </p><p>The Auspicious Seal!  </p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang felt a surge of energy within his body, his bones cracking.  </p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, he had rarely relied solely on his physical body in combat.  </p><p>During the Golden Core stage, there had been a period when his cultivation stagnated, and his *Heavenly Demon Transformation* surpassed his cultivation level, allowing him to rely on his physical strength. However, back then, he had mostly relied on brute force.  </p><p>Now, practicing this top-tier body cultivation technique, Qin Sang truly understood how to best utilize the power contained within his body.  </p><p>The Auspicious Seal, as the first of the seven seals, primarily helped the cultivator understand themselves and mobilize the power within their body!  </p><p>At this moment, a radiant Buddha light shone between Qin Sang’s palms, centered on his hands, forming a phantom image of a giant Buddha, also forming the Auspicious Seal. This was an extraordinary phenomenon caused by the overflowing energy within Qin Sang’s body, coating him in a golden light, his skin taking on a bronze hue, as hard as iron, impervious to blades and swords!  </p><p>The energy within his body grew stronger, his meridians and bones resonating like thunder, sounding like Buddhist chants.  </p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang resembled a living Arhat walking the earth.  </p><p>The sheer magnitude of the commotion caused by using a body cultivation technique surprised Qin Sang, but he was not entirely pleased.  </p><p>He examined himself and realized that as his cultivation deepened, he could conceal these phenomena to avoid alerting enemies before even making a move.  </p><p>Forming seals was merely a form, a guide. Once he fully mastered this technique, he could form seals with his mind, acting freely without such complications.  </p><p>With a thought, the phantom image gradually receded, and the energy within his body condensed to its peak.  </p><p>Then, Qin Sang turned his gaze to the stone peak before him. His figure flickered, and he instantly appeared in front of the peak. With his energy condensed in his hands, he struck a massive boulder.  </p><p>Silently, a deep palm print appeared on the surface of the boulder, followed by cracks spreading outward from the print, as if a terrifying force was erupting from within.  </p><p>*Boom!*  </p><p>The stone peak shattered into pieces.  </p><p>What was astonishing was that no debris flew off the peak; instead, the entire peak turned to dust.  </p><p>Dust floated in the air, creating a hazy scene.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked at his palm, a strange light flashing in his eyes. In the past, he could have easily destroyed a stone peak with a punch, but he could never have achieved this level of control.  </p><p>Satisfied with the power of the Auspicious Seal, Qin Sang nodded and became even more eager to master the remaining six seals. He put away the technique and returned to his cave.  </p><p>He did not continue practicing the *Seven Masters’ Buddha Seals*. Instead, he took out the Sun God Tree. The aura of the South Ming Flame on the bud had deepened, and a faint outline of a divine bird was beginning to form within.  </p><p>Although it was still blurry, Qin Sang could barely make out the shape after careful examination.  </p><p>This was an encouraging discovery.  </p><p>After his divine sense took form, Qin Sang clearly felt that his control had strengthened, and the South Ming Flame was condensing much faster. Everything was progressing smoothly, evolving in the direction he had envisioned.  </p><p>“At this rate, the divine bird will take shape within a few years, definitely before the Holy Land opens…”  </p><p>Qin Sang carefully inspected the Sun God Tree, a look of joy in his eyes.  </p><p>He could not accurately estimate the power of the Sun God Tree, but he believed it would not be weaker than the Eighteen Demon Banners.  </p><p>Like the Eighteen Demon Banners, the Sun God Tree used a special method to seal a high-level spiritual flame, drawing upon a portion of its power. Unless encountering a unique opportunity, it could not develop its own sentience. Its power depended on the spiritual flame sealed within, and it could not be judged solely by the grade of a treasure or spiritual treasure.  </p><p>In the cultivation world, such situations were not uncommon.  </p><p>There were even some special magical tools that possessed abilities beyond those of treasures, highly valued by Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>...  </p><p>The sky was clear, and a gentle sea breeze blew.  </p><p>Far above the sea, two graceful figures flew towards Earth Tung Island, one in purple and the other in white, their beauty akin to twin lotuses. They were Shi Xue and Liuli, who had come from the Mixed Demon Island.  </p><p>Liuli was still dressed in plain white, her face veiled with a light gauze.  </p><p>Shi Xue, on the other hand, wore a purple robe, exuding an elegant aura.  </p><p>She shaded her eyes with her hand and looked ahead. “They rode the Grand Elder’s treasure carriage, so they’re faster than us. If that heartless man hasn’t gone back on his word, he should have already returned the sacred object. As long as that heartless man has a shred of conscience, he should be waiting for you near Earth Tung Island.”  </p><p>Liuli had been hearing about the “heartless man” all along.  </p><p>Shi Xue clearly knew the “heartless man’s” real name, but whether out of indignation for her junior sister or frustration over her own loss, she refused to change her way of addressing him.  </p><p>As they approached the agreed-upon location, Liuli looked at Shi Xue and reminded her, “His Daoist name is Qingfeng.”  </p><p>Qin Sang had previously agreed with Liuli that after becoming a guest elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, he would revert to his alias—Daoist Qingfeng.  </p><p>“I definitely won’t call him that to his face, junior sister! Do you think I’m stupid?”  </p><p>Shi Xue rolled her eyes, gritted her teeth, and snorted softly. “It’s just that I can’t beat that heartless man right now! One day, if I reach the Grand Elder’s level of cultivation, I’ll definitely beat him until he’s crawling on the ground, venting our grievances!”  </p><p>The Grand Elder had compensated her for her loss on behalf of the sect, but such a useful life-saving treasure was irreplaceable. In the end, she still felt at a loss.  </p><p>Liuli remained unmoved.  </p><p>Shi Xue fantasized about beating Qin Sang to a pulp, feeling a secret thrill, but then coughed in embarrassment. “Junior sister, the Grand Elder rewarded us with a Yin Li Pearl, which is more compatible with our needs than the other spiritual materials we had anticipated. If we can get three Earth Tung Fruits, your breakthrough should be foolproof, right?”  </p><p>As she spoke, she glanced at Liuli, but her tone was questioning.  </p><p>Seeing that Liuli’s expression remained unchanged and she did not respond, Shi Xue felt a pang of worry and hesitantly asked, “Junior sister, how do you feel about that heartless man now?”  </p><p>Liuli was silent for a moment before replying, “He is he, and I am I.”  </p><p>Shi Xue’s lips moved as if she were carefully choosing her words, stumbling slightly. “Junior sister, have you ever thought… that your current feelings might not be your true self, but influenced by the Ice Soul Sealing Emotion?”  </p><p>Liuli turned her head and silently looked at Shi Xue.  </p><p>Shi Xue immediately felt the pressure.  </p><p>“I don’t know if saying this is good or bad for you, junior sister. Consider it your senior sister’s ramblings. You’ve always had a firm Dao heart, so you won’t be swayed by my words.”  </p><p>Shi Xue first gave herself an excuse.  </p><p>“I don’t know what happened between you and that heartless man, and I won’t ask.  </p><p>“As the saying goes, the deeper the love, the harsher the blame.  </p><p>“Junior sister, you chose the Ice Soul Sealing Emotion, which can only mean that your feelings for him were genuine. That heartless man left a deep mark on your heart, unforgettable.  </p><p>“Such deep affection—in my hundreds of years of cultivation, I’ve never seen a second person like you. In the past, I always believed that romantic love was an illusion, that the so-called tossing and turning was merely a mortal’s delusion. It was you who changed my perspective.  </p><p>“He was persuaded by you to return the sacred object and helped you extract its power, obtaining the Yin Li Pearl. He still has a shred of conscience.  </p><p>“If there truly are feelings between you, why torment yourself?  </p><p>“Unless that heartless man did something unforgivable, if there’s any misunderstanding or emotional knot, take the initiative to resolve it. Being hesitant and reserved is not the way of us cultivators, and no external force can stop you.  </p><p>“For cultivators, especially us Nascent Soul cultivators, finding a suitable Dao companion is not easy. You met before reaching the Nascent Soul stage, so that heartless man’s age should be similar to yours. To have reached his current level of cultivation, his talent is no less than yours. In the future, he can accompany you, becoming an enviable immortal couple.  </p><p>“The Ice Soul Sealing Emotion is not a necessity for cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light.  </p><p>“Junior sister, you also don’t need to worry that ‘emotion’ will affect your cultivation.  </p><p>“The cultivation world has never lacked dual cultivation techniques. The union of yin and yang is natural. We cultivators follow the Heavenly Dao, and deliberately avoiding or suppressing our true feelings will only create inner demons.  </p><p>“By using the Ice Soul Sealing Emotion, you are practicing the method of detachment.  </p><p>“In the past, Senior Du Zhong of the Purple Mist Pavilion was stuck at a bottleneck for hundreds of years. He simply left seclusion, sealed his cultivation, forgot his identity as a cultivator, and entered the mortal world to marry and have children, experiencing life, death, and the cycle of reincarnation. Through this, he broke through his illusions and advanced, becoming a legendary tale. This is the method of engagement.  </p><p>“Refining the heart has always been divided into detachment and engagement, with no superiority or inferiority between them.”  </p><p>Having said all this in one breath, Shi Xue paused to catch her breath, afraid that her words might be misunderstood by Liuli. She quickly added, “These are just my personal opinions. I don’t know what choice would be right for you, junior sister. I only hope that you can examine your true heart and not be blinded by your techniques, as that would only harm your cultivation.”  </p><p>Liuli listened silently, then looked at Shi Xue sincerely and said, “Senior sister, I understand. Thank you.”  </p><p>Shi Xue forced a smile. “I’m just talking theory, junior sister. Take it as you will.”  </p><p>A moment of silence passed between them.  </p><p>After flying for a while, the two saw the deserted island and then noticed a streak of light flying out from the island. It was Qin Sang, who had sensed their arrival.  </p><p>Shi Xue pursed her lips but quickly regained her composure.  </p><p>“This humble Daoist, Qingfeng, greets the two fairies.”  </p><p>Qin Sang flew forward and cupped his hands in greeting.  </p><p>Liuli nodded in return.  </p><p>Shi Xue maintained the demeanor of a sect leader, not losing any dignity. “No need for formalities! Daoist, you must have already returned the sacred object. From now on, you are a guest elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion. There’s no need for such courtesy between us.”  </p><p>Qin Sang smiled casually. “I’m new here, so I’ll need Sect Leader Shi’s guidance. I hope Sect Leader Shi and Fairy Liuli can forgive my previous offenses. I’ve always been a lone wolf, accustomed to caution and vigilance. That’s how I’ve survived until now.”  </p><p>He offered a half-truth as an explanation and an apology.  </p><p>Although Shi Xue’s strength was not enough to trouble Qin Sang, as a guest elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, he still needed to use this channel to investigate the Profound Heaven Palace’s Holy Land. He didn’t want the sect leader to hold a grudge against him, as it would only complicate matters.  </p><p>*You still have the nerve to bring it up!*  </p><p>Shi Xue snorted inwardly.  </p><p>However, although she was angry at Qin Sang for damaging her treasure, she also understood that the root cause was the Profound Heaven Palace’s ambush. Qin Sang had merely retaliated. Coupled with her junior sister’s relationship with him, she didn’t truly hate him.  </p><p>Hearing a hint in Qin Sang’s words, Shi Xue asked in surprise, “You’re a rogue cultivator?”  </p><p>“I’ve had places to stay, but in the end, I’ve always drifted alone.”  </p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Liuli.  </p><p>Thinking of the past, he had once believed he could remain a disciple of Shaohua Mountain forever, but fate had other plans. Now, he had established the Green Goat Temple, but it could no longer serve as his foundation.  </p><p>Shi Xue’s surprise grew. A rogue cultivator had actually achieved such accomplishments. She couldn’t help but think, *No wonder junior sister can’t forget him.*  </p><p>As they spoke, the three of them flew towards Earth Tung Island together.  </p><p>Shi Xue suddenly remembered something and looked at Qin Sang. “Are you planning to show your true face? If news about you reaches the Profound Heaven Palace, someone might recognize you.”  </p><p>Qin Sang was prepared and was about to take out a bamboo hat.  </p><p>Shi Xue reached into her storage bag and pulled out a thin, cicada-wing-like mask. “This is the Thousand Fox Mask. It can alter your appearance within a certain range, seamlessly blending in. I’ll lend it to you for now. With your strong divine sense, wearing this mask, only the Grand Elder and the Sect Leader of the Profound Heaven Palace would be able to see through it with their naked eyes. You’ll only need to be wary of a few individuals with special treasures or techniques, but they usually only use them during combat to avoid offending others. Just try to avoid meeting them.”  </p><p>She emphasized the word “lend.”  </p><p>Qin Sang didn’t mind and thanked her, taking the mask and putting it on. He immediately felt a cool sensation.  </p><p>With the Thousand Fox Mask on, Qin Sang focused his mind, and his facial features shifted slightly, appearing somewhat eerie. Then, his appearance changed completely, making him look more like a wandering Daoist.  </p><p>“Truly ingenious!”  </p><p>Qin Sang praised.</p>
