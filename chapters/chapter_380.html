Chapter 373: The Hive


Outside the hive, poisonous bees swarmed.
The spirit-binding rope was well concealed, undetected by the bees, and silently approached the hive from below.
The Ghost-Head Bees, so named for their bee-like appearance and clustered habit, and their nest resembling a beehive, are not actually bees but a strange insect.
Their characteristics differ significantly from those of real bee colonies; they lack a queen and appear in pairs.
If these poisonous bees retained the characteristics of Ghost-Head Bees, Qin Sang only needed to capture a few pairs.
The spirit-binding rope lay in wait, observing for an opportunity.
A poisonous bee circled the hive, its range widening until it finally separated from the swarm.
The spirit-binding rope sprang out like a serpent.
The poisonous bee was exceptionally alert; the moment the rope attempted to ensnare it, the bee detected the threat, aiming its stinger at the rope.  Its three pairs of blood-red wings vibrated intensely, emitting an incredibly shrill sound.
This sound, if it reached the others, would alarm the entire swarm, forcing a hasty retreat.
Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared. The instant the bee reacted, the spirit-binding rope accelerated, suddenly striking, firmly ensnaring the bee before silently retracting.
The rope, with the captured bee, landed in Qin Sang's palm.
The poisonous bee remained restless, struggling fiercely, but the spirit-binding rope could restrain even Foundation Establishment cultivators, let alone a mere insect.
Qin Sang avoided the bee's stinger, carefully examining it. Comparing several key features, he confirmed its strong resemblance to a Ghost-Head Bee.
He tentatively named it the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee.
Others curiously approached. An elder softly said, “Daoist Qingfeng, might I have a look at this poisonous bee?”
Qin Sang understood the elder wanted to examine the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee's characteristics, seeking a way to harvest the Blood Poison Flower.
He had captured this Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee with ease because this hive was on the outer edge, the smallest, and the swarm was sparse.
Around the Blood Poison Flower, several enormous hives were clustered together, the bees a dense cloud – a truly terrifying sight that made any attempt at individual capture impossible.
Unexpectedly, the moment Qin Sang handed the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee to the elder, there was a 'pop' – a loud burst.
A spray of dark blood erupted.
Everyone was startled, quickly moving out of the way. The Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee had self-destructed.
The jade slip did mention that Ghost-Head Bees are ferocious and extremely difficult to tame.  These mutated Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bees were even worse, choosing self-destruction upon capture and facing certain defeat.
Qin Sang's expression darkened. He repeated the process, capturing several more, all with the same result.
Finally, Qin Sang depleted the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bees around the small hive, carefully removing it.  He swept his spiritual sense through the hive; inside were indeed Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bee eggs.
Could these larvae be tamed?
Qin Sang pondered, placing the hive into his storage pouch and stopping there.
Firstly, others wouldn't wait indefinitely, and secondly, the other hives were densely packed together, making it impossible to remove a hive without alarming the Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bees.
Waiting for the larvae to hatch would reveal the answer.
Qin Sang nodded to the others, signaling their departure.
Seeing Qin Sang about to leave, the elder's face fell.  “Daoist, wait!”
“What is it, friend?”
Qin Sang feigned ignorance.
“Daoist, could we speak privately?”
The elder pulled Qin Sang aside, bowing deeply.  “I see the Daoist is very knowledgeable about these poisonous bees. I would be grateful for your guidance.”
Qin Sang appeared pensive, neither agreeing nor refusing.
The elder, understanding, took out a lump of what he’d been given, a cold gold ore from his storage pouch.  “I have little to offer, only this cold gold ore; I hope the Daoist will accept it.”
This person was generous; apparently, the Blood Poison Flower was crucial to him and his apprentice.
Qin Sang spoke truthfully, “To be frank, friend, I do know something about an insect called the Ghost-Head Bee. I suspect these Blood-Winged Ghost-Head Bees are a mutated variety. However, whether they retain the traits of Ghost-Head Bees after their mutation due to the blood miasma, I cannot say for certain.”
Upon hearing this, disappointment clouded the elder's face, but he didn't retract the cold gold ore.
He had asked others before, but nobody was willing to risk their lives and face the poisonous bees for a piece of cold gold ore.


The old man, having no better option, reluctantly compromised.

Qin Sang nodded, took the cold-iron ore, copied the jade slip's description of the Ghost-head Bees onto another slip, and gave it to the old man.

Master and apprentice remained behind, leaving only five in the group.  All five were experts, and traveling at full speed, they were much faster than before.

Soon, they reached the mountain foot and continued onward, their figures disappearing into the blood miasma.

Shortly after Qin Sang and the others left, a figure followed from behind.  This person paused, looked at the mountain, then at the direction Qin Sang's party had gone, hesitating.  Suddenly, their gaze sharpened, as if they had spotted something.  Without hesitation, they used their movement technique and dashed forward.

...

The journey continued without incident.

Kong Xin, diligently fulfilling his duty, successfully guided them out of the blood miasma.

Within the Boundless Valley, except for certain areas, there was no blood miasma, so they no longer needed the Azure Sun Devilfire for protection.

Qin Sang put away the jade pendant and surveyed the surroundings.

Inside the Boundless Valley, the areas inside and outside the blood miasma were clearly two different worlds.  To the naked eye, there were mountains and rivers, flowers and grass; it seemed no different from outside the valley.

However, the endless, persistent crimson clouds in the sky, and the strange roars echoing from the distance, constantly reminded everyone that they were indeed within the Boundless Valley!

These clouds were likely the result of a mix of ancient restrictions and ferocious blood煞 energy; there might even be spatial rifts hidden within.  It was best not to fly at high altitudes.

Kong Xin, without much explanation, briefly described the precautions before leading the way.

The first half of the Boundless Valley wasn't very dangerous; Qi Refinement cultivators could enter and search for treasures if they found the right path.  The deeper they went, the more perilous it became.

During their journey, frequent detours were commonplace; sometimes they had to circumvent several times to find a safe route, avoiding monster groups or unknown restrictions.

This was a direct result of Qin Sang and the others' strong insistence.

After the ordeal in the subterranean cavern, Kong Xin found it difficult to gain their complete trust.  Every so often, he was required to explain the route in detail, after which the group would analyze and vote on it together.

This proved tiresome for Kong Xin, but he had no choice.

The journey was uneventful, and they successfully reached their destination.

After crossing a small ridge, a stream, like a jade ribbon, flowed down from the mountain.

Kong Xin's spirits lifted, and he exclaimed, "We've arrived!"

Qin Sang quickly followed, surveying the surroundings while subtly glancing behind him, secretly surprised.

Along the way, he and Yun Youzi had been extremely vigilant, intentionally revealing several weaknesses.

Unexpectedly, their pursuer had not reappeared, seemingly having vanished.
