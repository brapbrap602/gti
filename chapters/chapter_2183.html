<h1>Chapter 2173: Heart Lake</h1><p>Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal!</p><p>The girl in the red dress was startled, realizing that Qin Sang relied on more than just the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock.</p><p>In the eye of the formation, the girl in the red dress appeared, surrounded by two huge flames, like torches, constantly rotating.  These flames were brighter than elsewhere, formed from her two most important beast hordes.</p><p>These spirit beasts were carefully selected from countless others, a process that took immense effort and time. They were the foundation of her beast formation and incredibly precious to her.</p><p>Qin Sang’s timing was impeccable; he held complete control. Even when the girl in the red dress detonated the formation's power, it didn't change the situation.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying power of the green thunder, the girl in the red dress flicked her sleeve, retrieving one torch, but she was too late to save the other.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>That torch, along with the girl in the red dress, was annihilated by the thunder.</p><p>The instant the green thunder exploded, spirit beasts were born from the torch, each ferocious and fearless, but to no avail.</p><p>The Lang Xian Yuan lineage and the approach of spirit beast masters who focus on cultivating a single spirit beast to the point of life-binding are polar opposites. The spirit beasts' cultivation might not be exceptionally high, but when combined with the beast formation, they could unleash terrifying power.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly. While it seemed the girl in the red dress had been killed by the green thunder, it wasn't her true form. At the last moment, Qin Sang glimpsed a fleeting shadow of a firebird, likely some sort of avatar technique.</p><p>Surprisingly, he couldn't figure out how she escaped.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang’s gaze swept across the surroundings.</p><p>With the formation's power detonated, this area was finally reduced to ruin. The mountain range was instantly leveled; the forests and vegetation were reduced to ashes. The earth was scorched, transformed into a lake of magma; the beautiful scenery was gone.</p><p>The Sky-Trapping Golden Lock trembled under the impact of the formation's power, but the golden light continued to expand rapidly.</p><p>Ultimately, almost half of the flames were trapped within the void.</p><p>The other half scattered.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes turned cold as he channeled the power of thunder.  Countless bolts of lightning descended from the heavens.</p><p>Lightning filled the sky like a forest, thunder like rain, sweeping across the land in a devastating torrent.</p><p>The flames trapped in the void were struck by lightning, transforming back into their spirit beast forms.  It turned out they hadn't been burned to death; the *Zhao Yang Fu* had put them into a strange state.</p><p>However, they had been abandoned by the girl in the red dress and perished under the lightning strikes, unaware of their fate.</p><p>The other half of the flames were also extinguished in the rain of lightning. Some reverted to their beast forms, dying in agony and terror, exploding into a bloody mist; others simply dissipated – these spirit beasts were likely reclaimed by the girl in the red dress.</p><p>Until the very end, Qin Sang couldn't find the girl's true form; the Sky-Eye Butterfly didn't detect any hidden figures.</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the air, retracted the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock, and scanned his surroundings, but to no avail.</p><p>The girl in the red dress had escaped, but Qin Sang wasn’t too disappointed.  Successfully killing a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator head-on was unlikely; his results were already magnificent.</p><p>The girl in the red dress lost half of her core spirit beasts, and more than half of her beast horde was annihilated by Qin Sang. The loss of her core spirit beasts would severely impact her strength, rendering many complex beast formations unusable. Until her beast horde recovered, even if they met again, she wouldn’t pose much of a threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>A dark cloud drifted from the mountain, and Liuli and Le Chen appeared. The cloud contracted, forming a soft pouch which Le Chen put away.</p><p>Liuli suffered backlash from the talismans, and Le Chen, whose wounds hadn't fully healed, both looked weak but could still stand.</p><p>Qin Sang descended.</p><p>Liuli exchanged a glance with him, smiling slightly, then looked at the battlefield, a gleam of excitement and aspiration in her eyes.</p><p>Being able to contribute in a battle between Nascent Soul cultivators, capturing one and forcing another to retreat, allowed her to truly appreciate the abilities of Nascent Soul cultivators and fueled her ambition to reach that level.</p><p>Le Chen looked around vigilantly: “Senior Brother’s battle with them was quite a spectacle. It may have attracted unwanted attention. We can't stay here long!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli nodded, and the three of them took flight, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Shortly after they left, other figures arrived, circling overhead before departing.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions were at a loss for what to do next, so they decided to head towards Feng Huo Mountain.  On the way, Qin Sang noticed that Chen’s complexion was growing paler, and the backlash from Liuli’s body was intensifying.  They discussed the situation and the three of them descended to the ground, creating a cave dwelling.</p><p>Two of them immediately closed themselves off to heal, while Qin Sang set up a powerful formation around the cave to protect them.</p><p>After confirming that no pursuers were following, Qin Sang entered the cave, created a new chamber, and threw the captured woman's spirit body inside. He left her there, not immediately interrogating her. He then returned to the entrance of the cave, sat cross-legged, and summoned his Grey Warbler sword.</p><p>The sentient sword, seemingly exhilarated by the recent victory, hummed softly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, connected his mind with the sword, and closed his eyes, reliving the battle.</p><p>The power of that sword strike was considerable, but there were still many imperfections.  Before he fully grasped the true power of the Sword Domain, he had much room for improvement.  Each major battle might even lead to new understandings.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully reflected on the battle, further refining his sword techniques. Three days later, a tremendous roar startled him awake.</p><p>He frowned, flew out of the cave, and looked out from the high ground. In the south, a brilliant beam of light shot up into the sky.</p><p>This light seemed to emanate from the earth. The ground had sunk, and the light continued to erupt outwards. When the light subsided, a bottomless pit remained.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, then approached cautiously, circling the area.  Finding no trace of any hidden realm or ancient ruins, he returned to the cave.</p><p>Two more days passed before Qin Sang felt another tremor.  He surmised that another light eruption had occurred in the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then separated a strand of his consciousness to awaken Chen, before entering the chamber where the woman was imprisoned.</p><p>A beam of light pierced the darkness of the chamber.</p><p>The woman in ornate robes sat cross-legged on a cushion, her spirit body shimmering.  She opened her eyes and saw Qin Sang.  A flash of fear crossed her eyes, quickly replaced by anger, though it seemed somewhat forced.</p><p>Qin Sang observed her changing emotions but remained unfazed.  "How should I address you, Daoist friend?" he asked calmly, as if she were not an enemy but a stranger.</p><p>The woman remained silent for a moment before replying, “My surname is Zhao.”</p><p>The legacy of the Lang Xian Yuan could be traced back to the Taishang Dao Sect. Though their practices differed greatly from traditional Daoism, they still considered themselves Daoist disciples.</p><p>"Daoist Zhao," Qin Sang nodded. "I wish to ask you a few questions."</p><p>"Do you think I will answer?" Daoist Zhao sneered.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Had I not arrived in time, my two companions would have suffered the same fate.  Daoist Zhao, you brought this upon yourself; there's no need to blame fate. If you cooperate, you can avoid the ordeal of soul-searching."</p><p>Daoist Zhao’s expression stiffened, but she stubbornly insisted, "It's all the same whether I live or die! We are of comparable cultivation; even soul-searching will not yield you anything!"</p><p>At that moment, Chen entered from outside.</p><p>Hearing Daoist Zhao's words, he clasped his hands together, chanted a Buddhist mantra, and said with a compassionate tone, "Amitabha Buddha! Soul-searching is against the harmony of heaven and earth.  I beg Qin Zhenren to reconsider. I possess a scroll of the *Du Yan Sutra*, which may be able to convert Daoist Zhao to Buddhism.  She could then protect our temple, reducing the need for violence."</p><p>Daoist Zhao was startled by this, and blurted out, "You bald monk, dare you!"</p><p>Being converted by this Buddhist sutra and becoming a temple protector would mean the loss of self, leaving one in a daze, like a living corpse – worse than death.</p><p>Chen sighed, shaking his head.  "The *Du Yan Sutra* is a superior scripture of our temple. Daoist Zhao misunderstands Buddhism greatly."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke up, his voice cold.  "I am not boasting, but though the other Zhenren did not perish, she was severely weakened and will have little impact in the Heart Lake. Whether Daoist Zhao speaks or not, the outcome will be the same.  The true secrets are beyond your knowledge anyway.  Just tell us what you know, and I promise you a swift death."</p><p>Chen added, "Our temple has ancient ties with the Taishang Dao Sect.  As far as I know, eight thousand years ago, a senior member of the Bi Chen Xuan was accidentally injured by our temple’s founder, who then brought him back to the monastery, treated him as a guest, and respectfully escorted him back to Kan Prefecture. If Daoist Zhao cooperates, I will persuade Qin Zhenren to spare your life."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's threat, Daoist Zhao, who had been prepared to die rather than yield, suddenly lit up.  "Is that true?"</p><p>Even an ant clings to life.  Having cultivated to this level, who would willingly choose death if there is a chance to live?</p><p>Qin Sang was right.  The true secret of Heart Lake was only revealed to his senior sister, and his junior sister's duty was to follow her orders.</p><p>Of course, given her status, she had also managed to gather some valuable information.</p><p>Liao Chen glanced at Qin Sang and said, "Langxian Garden will undoubtedly offer a substantial reward in exchange for Zhao Zhenren. After leaving the Sacred Land, I can negotiate on your behalf and deliver all the treasures to Qin Zhenren's Daoist temple, asking for leniency."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, snorted, and coldly stared at Zhao Zhenren. "Let's see what she can offer to save her life!"</p><p>Zhao Zhenren remained silent for a long time, finally making a decision.  After receiving Liao Chen's assurance, she slowly began to speak.</p><p>At this moment, Liuli was also awakened from her meditative state. The three of them stood silently beside her, the only sound in the quiet room being Zhao Zhenren's voice.</p><p>Soon after Zhao Zhenren finished speaking, Qin Sang re-imprisoned her primordial spirit and stored it away, not handing it directly to Liao Chen. He agreed not to kill her, but he didn't say he wouldn't use her. If the red-dressed girl later continued to harass him, he could use this woman's primordial spirit to threaten her.</p><p>"How are your injuries?" Qin Sang asked Liuli and Liao Chen.</p><p>"I'm fine now," Liuli replied. Her complexion had largely recovered.  Before their departure, Ning Zhenren had given her pills to counter the backlash from the spirit talismans, allowing for a swift recovery.</p><p>Liao Chen said solemnly, "We've already wasted too much time, and the Sacred Land's upheaval is intensifying. As Qin Zhenren said, it might eventually affect the entire Sacred Land. If we don't hurry to Heart Lake, we might miss a crucial opportunity!"</p><p>"How is the monk's injury?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Liao Chen's injuries were a serious problem. He had brought many spirit pills and elixirs from Purple Cloud Mountain, but in just a few days, his injuries had only slightly improved. Qin Sang had searched Zhao Zhenren's belongings and found many pills, but none were suitable for his condition.</p><p>"I've managed to suppress my injuries; they won't hinder our journey. I can treat them slowly along the way.  Moreover, while crossing Heart Lake, as long as we remain vigilant, there shouldn't be any major danger, and I can heal myself. By the time we reach the depths of Heart Lake, I will be much better and won't burden my junior sister and Qin Zhenren," Liao Chen explained.</p><p>Heart Lake was their destination. Though called a lake, it was vast, like an ocean.</p><p>It was said to be the center of the Sacred Land, hence its name.</p><p>Heart Lake's location was special. Anyone could see that it was extraordinary, harboring countless opportunities and treasures.</p><p>Initially, Heart Lake was a place of fierce competition among the strong 異人族 (Yi Renzu – people of different origins).  Later, as the opportunities were gradually exhausted, the remaining challenges grew too difficult, and fewer people came.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard from Ning Zhenren that a place where one could absorb the spiritual energy of the immortal mountain was located within Heart Lake.  Furthermore, there was an opportunity there for Liuli that could help her overcome her karmic tribulation.</p><p>Liuli cultivated the Supreme Path of Forgetfulness, not out of her own will, but because she believed that everyone she cared about was dead, and she had become heartbroken and forced herself to forget. There was an element of avoidance in her approach.</p><p>Initially, she wholeheartedly sought to save her master. Later, she and Qin Sang were entangled in a complex relationship, a bond of love or hatred, their connection deepening, her life trapped by the single word 'love.'</p><p>These were all hidden dangers. Even after Liuli started cultivating the Supreme Path of Forgetfulness, the dangers didn't disappear, but were merely suppressed, only to erupt even more violently later.</p><p>Karmic tribulations are adept at stirring the deepest weaknesses of the heart. If these hidden dangers were exploited by a karmic tribulation, it could lead to her ruin. However, it also presented the best chance to resolve these issues. She must face this ordeal head-on; otherwise, she would never achieve greatness. Even Ning Zhenren, despite personally guiding Liuli, wasn't entirely confident.  It all depended on Liuli's resilience and her ability to overcome her internal struggles.</p><p>Qin Sang's appearance brought a turning point. Ning Zhenren told him that if he and Liuli entered a special secret realm, they would have a chance to help Liuli overcome her tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang found it unbelievable, but the world was full of wonders, and Ning Zhenren wouldn't have spoken without reason.  Entering Heart Lake would prove whether it was true.</p><p>In addition, Ning Zhenren also wanted Liuli to try to obtain a treasure from Heart Lake—a post-heaven spiritual treasure. He said that if Liuli failed, Qin Sang could try as well.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly didn't take this seriously!</p><p>He hadn't yet learned the secret technique to use blood-impurity divine light to deceive the spirit of an artifact. Even if he could obtain the post-heaven spiritual treasure, without the artifact's recognition, he wouldn't be able to wield it.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn't only they who were after this post-heaven spiritual treasure; the two women from Langxian Garden were also seeking it.</p><p>For many years, the most important objective of the human forces entering the Sacred Land was to find this post-heaven spiritual treasure. The conflict between Purple Cloud Mountain and these forces stemmed from this.</p><p>They had extracted some secrets from Zhao Zhenren about Langxian Garden's discoveries at Heart Lake, but how useful this information would be remained to be seen.</p>
