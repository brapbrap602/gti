<h1></h1><p>Yuefei, who had been trying to stop Qin Sang moments before, now seemed to harbor a deep-seated hatred for Elder Yanshan.  Her normally enchanting eyes blazed with fury as she unleashed a relentless barrage of magical treasures and Daoist techniques upon him, seemingly without regard for their cost.  As the beloved concubine of Lu Laomo's adopted son, Yuefei naturally lacked no magical treasures.  The loss of her Gossamer Veil treasure at the beginning of the battle seemed to have little impact on her. Following the Thunder Pearl and the silver bracelet, she swiftly produced a jeweled crystal knife with hanging tassels from her Mustard Seed Pouch.  Elder Yanshan, overwhelmed by the onslaught, struggled to defend himself.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and continued to break the formation. He had already deciphered the internal structure and flow of the spiritual formation, and his progress was accelerating.  The Snow-Treading Divine Knife moved faster and faster, etching rune after rune, resembling cryptic symbols, into the spiritual formation, transforming it beyond recognition.</p><p>"Almost..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt over seventy percent confident. Luye was nearby, and a swift escape was paramount.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang hooked his finger, and the Snow-Treading Divine Knife flew back into his hand.  At its tip, sword energy condensed into fine threads, maintaining a connection with the spiritual formation.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Back in his grasp, the divine knife returned to its normal size.</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the air, looking down from above. True Essence surged within him, empowering the Snow-Treading Divine Knife as he swept it across the void.  The seemingly gentle stroke lacked a dazzling aura.  The ethereal sword energy, like a delicate feather, moved with deceptive speed, landing on the surface of the spiritual formation without a trace of fanfare.</p><p>Simultaneously, the sword energy Qin Sang had left within the formation disk erupted, echoing the knife's strike.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>Like hot water melting snow.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Knife effortlessly carved a hundred-zhang long scar into the icy surface, grazing the ice pillar and slicing into the very heart of the spiritual formation.  This single strike severed the complex flow of energy within the formation, dismantling it with minimal effort. It was a perfect execution, a stroke of sheer brilliance!</p><p>Only with the assistance of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could Qin Sang have achieved such perfection.</p><p>Elder Yanshan couldn't help but shout his admiration.</p><p>"It's done!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a wave of relief. It had appeared effortless, but the process had been incredibly mentally taxing.</p><p>With that single strike, the spiritual formation remained visually unchanged, yet its essence had been fundamentally altered.  The runes on the formation disk dimmed one by one, accelerating until, in the blink of an eye, most of the disk was shrouded in darkness, its power rapidly dissipating.</p><p>Seeing the transformation of the spiritual formation, Yuefei's expression turned frantic.  She directed the crystal knife to entangle Elder Yanshan's restraining cords, then bit her tongue, spraying a mist of blood onto the silver bracelet. The bracelet instantly turned crimson, absorbing the blood and emitting a sinister glow, revealing its nature as a wicked artifact.</p><p>With a hum, the silver bracelet split into two, snapping open and closed as it lunged towards Elder Yanshan.</p><p>The whooshing sound snapped Elder Yanshan's attention back.  Seeing the formidable power of the silver bracelet, he dared not be careless.  His fingers moved like a wheel, forming an incredibly complex hand seal.</p><p>The Dragon Head Shield was still warding off the Thunder Pearl, which continued to unleash bolts of lightning. The shield's material was extraordinary, impervious to the lightning's corrosive power. The bolts could only pierce the water curtain, unable to harm the shield itself.</p><p>The shield shuddered violently, sending out visible ripples like waves, which surged towards the Thunder Pearl with blinding speed. This time, it shifted from defense to offense.</p><p>The ripples forcibly extinguished the pink lightning and crashed against the Thunder Pearl, which was instantly flung skyward by an immense force.</p><p>Elder Yanshan immediately recalled the Dragon Head Shield, intending to use the same tactic against the silver bracelet.</p><p>However, this played right into Yuefei's hands. The silver bracelet was aimed at the Dragon Head Shield all along.  The two halves twisted, transforming into flexible, worm-like tendrils.  As the shield approached, they advanced rather than retreated, coiling around it from both sides, their ends meeting to form a complete circle.  In an instant, the Dragon Head Shield was tightly bound by a crimson ring.</p><p>Elder Yanshan froze momentarily, then hurriedly urged the shield, which vibrated violently with a loud hum. However, the blood ring proved incredibly resilient, resisting his attempts to break free.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Yanshan noticed something amiss with Yuefei.  Recalling the previous incident, he plummeted downwards, tapping the ice beneath his feet. Silver light shimmered on the surface, like scattered silver dust.  It was the drop of water Elder Yanshan had previously dispersed, which he hadn't yet recalled.  This was a type of spiritual water he had refined for many years, falsely claiming it to be derived from the celestial Heavenly River and presumptuously naming it One-Yuan Heavy Water.  True One-Yuan Heavy Water was a legendary substance, and this spiritual water naturally couldn't compare, but it possessed the characteristic of immense weight, able to coalesce and disperse at will, with myriad uses.</p><p>The silver dust rapidly gathered at the tip of Elder Yanshan's foot, seeping into the ice below.  From a distance, one could see a vertical silver foil abruptly appear within the ice layer.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice cave trembled with the sound of metal clashing against metal.</p><p>A figure burst out from within the ice, none other than Yuefei, who had attempted to repeat her previous maneuver and burrow into the ice to seize the Cold Crystal.  However, her path was blocked by the One-Yuan Heavy Water, her scheme foiled by Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had just breathed a sigh of relief whenâ€¦</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Ice shards exploded outwards.</p><p>Yuefei, abandoning her attempt to force her way through, erupted from the ice, transforming her body into a blade as she lunged towards Elder Yanshan with suicidal abandon.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had already reached the ice pillar, reaching out to grab the Cold Crystal. His gaze suddenly froze.</p><p>Within the ice pillar, a strange blue light silently brewed. Not only within the pillar, but throughout the ice cave, blue light points appeared above, below, left, and right, sparkling like a starry sky.</p><p>A formation within a formation!</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled as he shouted, "Careful!"</p><p>...</p><p>As the fierce battle raged within the ice cave, Qin Sang's true body entered the snowy plains, descending underground to find the source of the anomaly.  What met his eyes was a colossal ice storm. Looking down from above, he could see a spiral forming at the storm's center, where bone-chilling winds whipped ice shards into a furious vortex.  The spiral's lower end led to an unknown destination, but Qin Sang could sense his avatar and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly within.</p><p>The ice storm's range and power had both far surpassed its initial eruption.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, channeling True Essence to protect himself, then plunged into the storm.</p><p>*Whoosh! Bang! Bang! Bang!...*</p><p>The howling wind.</p><p>The sound of ice shards impacting his protective True Essence.</p><p>Chaos reigned around Qin Sang, obscuring his vision.  His spiritual sense was also restricted.  He recognized the influence of a spiritual formation but didn't detect any barrier.</p><p>Descending further, Qin Sang realized that the primary factor disrupting his spiritual sense and blurring the connection with his avatar was the chaotic Cold Sha Qi permeating the area.</p><p>"A spiritual formation of this level poses no threat to my avatar..." Qin Sang thought, remaining vigilant.</p><p>As he delved deeper, the connection with his avatar and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly grew clearer.  However, the incessant barrage of ice and the dense Cold Sha Qi prevented him from fully perceiving their thoughts.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang sensed something behind him.  Shortly after he had entered the ice storm, Wu Lao, dispatched to pursue him, had also been drawn by the storm's fluctuations.  Having failed to locate Yuefei outside, he suspected she might be inside and had followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Lao, one behind the other.</p><p>Both had come to assist, both harboring the intent to take their opponents by surprise.  They had both suppressed their auras and remained undetected by each other outside.</p><p>However, within the ice storm, forced to resist the onslaught of Cold Sha Qi, concealment was no longer possible.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered Wu Lao at the same instant Wu Lao sensed someone ahead!</p><p>"Someone's coming from behind!"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. A sudden premonition of danger gripped him.  His face darkened.  The Thousand Jun Ring flickered, launching a sword arc with lightning speed.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The Goldfall Sword appeared before Qin Sang, intercepting a black iron hook.</p><p>Wu Lao, sent to aid Yuefei, was consumed by concern for her safety.  He was certain that anyone he encountered here was either Yuefei or an enemy, deserving of death.  Thus, he had launched a sneak attack without hesitation.</p><p>The iron hook, known as the Bone-Melting Hook, was a sinister and insidious treasure, responsible for the deaths of countless cultivators.</p><p>To Wu Lao's surprise, the hook was easily blocked.</p><p>Sword and hook clashed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his blood surge, stirred by the Bone-Melting Hook.  Had he not cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement Technique*, possessing a physique comparable to a Demon King, he would have suffered a serious blow.</p><p>Without hesitation, ignoring his churning blood, he followed the trajectory of the Bone-Melting Hook, locating his attacker, and retaliated with a Heavenly Thunder strike!</p><p>A crack of thunder.</p><p>He unleashed the Command Thunder Technique.</p><p>A bolt of lightning materialized within the storm, its brilliance blinding, its roar deafening.</p><p>Wu Lao felt a sharp pain in his head, his hairs standing on end.  He let out a roar, spitting a ball of blood light from his mouth, revealing a thumb-sized blood jade.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In the nick of time, the blood jade intercepted the lightning.  Its crimson glow dimmed, knocked downwards.</p><p>Wu Lao swiftly dodged aside, retrieving the blood jade.  Seeing its diminished light, he ignored the pang of regret, still shaken by the close call. He had underestimated his opponent.</p><p>Qin Sang also sighed.</p><p>The instantaneous and unpredictable nature of the Command Thunder Technique made it ideal for ambushes and counterattacks.  However, as his cultivation increased and his True Essence deepened, the proportion of True Essence mobilized by the technique decreased, preventing its power from scaling proportionally.  It would gradually become less exceptional.</p><p>Currently, the Command Thunder Technique could still be considered a top-tier divine ability, but it could no longer rival Nascent Soul cultivators with the same defiance of natural order it had displayed during his Golden Core stage.</p><p>"Late Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Lao assessed each other, both filled with awe.  Encountering a grand cultivator in such a remote and desolate place puzzled Qin Sang, making him grateful that his true body had followed, preventing him from repeating his avatar's mistake.</p><p>On second thought, it wasn't so strange.  At his level, only the rarest of treasures could pique his interest, and those qualified to compete for them were bound to be powerful cultivators of similar realm.</p><p>The predicament his avatar had encountered was likely no accident!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>Wu Lao scrutinized Qin Sang, coldly demanding, "Who are you! Did you kill Yuefei?"</p><p>Although Yuefei possessed protective treasures bestowed by the Young Master, she had been kept like a caged bird in Luye, her horizons limited.  Her usual sparring partners were a few Nether Moon Guards who dared not harm her, always holding back.  If she encountered a grand cultivator, Wu Lao doubted her ability to escape.</p><p>"What Yuefei?"  Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.  His words confirmed that something unexpected had occurred below. He raised his sword to strike!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Goldfall Sword shot towards Wu Lao's face like another bolt of lightning.</p><p>This time, Wu Lao was prepared. He wielded the Bone-Melting Hook, conjuring multiple shadowy hooks whose tips aimed at the Goldfall Sword's blade, attempting to trap it.</p><p>However, as the Goldfall Sword approached, Wu Lao noticed something peculiar about its light, a sudden sense of danger washing over him.</p><p>Though unsure of the reason, Wu Lao unhesitatingly retracted the Bone-Melting Hook, slapping his dantian.  A stream of light shot out, expanding in the wind to reveal a short halberd.</p><p>This treasure, known as the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd, was Wu Lao's natal magic treasure.</p><p>He hadn't expected to be forced to summon his natal magic treasure so early in the fight, and moreover, to use it defensively.</p><p>At that moment, the Goldfall Sword arrived. Its light blurred, then abruptly vanished.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the surrounding ice storm froze.</p><p>The white ice shards seemed to be covered by a layer of grey gauze, like an invisible curtain expanding at an alarming rate.</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaying Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang had unleashed his killing move.</p><p>Having broken through to Late Nascent Soul, the sword formation's power was naturally far greater.</p><p>Wu Lao, caught off guard, felt his vision darken. Countless sword threads materialized around him, a sword technique he had never seen before.  Stimulated by the sword energy, his Nascent Soul throbbed with pain, as if the sword energy had pierced his internal organs.  A wave of icy fear washed over him.</p><p>The sword threads trembled, closing in to kill.</p><p>"Heaven-Fixing Divine Halberd!" Wu Lao retreated, muttering under his breath.</p><p>The Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd seemed to have a seal broken. Its edges became crimson, as if droplets of blood were flowing along them, emitting a pungent, bloody scent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Without any visible movement from Wu Lao, the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd vanished.</p><p>It hadn't truly vanished, but its speed had reached an extreme.</p><p>In an instant, the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd struck countless times, a dense swarm of halberd shadows filling the void.  Wherever the shadows touched, space seemed to solidify, worthy of the name "Heaven-Fixing"!</p><p>Sword formation and halberd shadows collided, a cacophony of booms echoing.</p><p>Sword threads and halberd shadows annihilated each other indiscriminately.</p><p>Wu Lao seized the opportunity to extricate himself.</p><p>The clash had ended in a stalemate.</p><p>"Pseudo-Spiritual Treasure!" Qin Sang's gaze fixed on the Blood-Drinking Demonic Halberd.</p><p>Judging by its power, it was inferior to Yin Changsheng's Suspended Sword Pavilion, and it likely had other abilities not yet revealed.  However, the Suspended Sword Pavilion had been refined by Yin Changsheng using the *Essence Sacrifice Technique* for an unknown number of years. Below the Deity Transformation stage, few could refine their natal magic treasures to such a level.</p><p>Concerned about his avatar, Qin Sang was unwilling to prolong the fight. He plummeted downwards.</p><p>Wu Lao, still pondering the Seven Souls Slaying Formation, was momentarily stunned.  Seeing Qin Sang's direction, he instantly understood. He pursued with his halberd, bellowing, "This is Luye's secret store! How dare you trespass! Retreat now, and your life will be spared!"</p><p>Hearing the words "Luye," Qin Sang's expression grew graver.  This person, wielding a Pseudo-Spiritual Treasure, was undoubtedly someone of consequence.  Could he truly be a descendant of Lu Laomo?</p><p>This was the second time he had been threatened since arriving in the Central Continent.</p><p>Were Deity Transformation descendants all this domineering?</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed inwardly.  He certainly wouldn't be deterred by a few words.  Regardless, reuniting with his avatar was the priority.</p><p>The two chased and fought.</p><p>As Qin Sang neared the ice cave, the connection with his avatar grew stronger, finally allowing him to vaguely perceive their thoughts.</p><p>"It's Luye! Stop him!"</p><p>The true body finally grasped the situation.  Below, it was a two-on-one fight, the situation under control.  He only needed to stop this old man from interfering.</p><p>The true body halted, withdrawing his sword. He waved his sleeve, and black light flashed from his brow as the Fire Lotus Seed shot out.</p><p>Demonic flames raged!</p>
