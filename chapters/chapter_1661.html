<h1>Chapter 1652: Celestial Fire</h1><p>The medicinal garden is a story for another time.</p><p>The deceased’s belongings are the real prize of this expedition.</p><p>With a cursory glance, Qin Sang discovered several items that greatly piqued his interest.</p><p>Qin Sang took out some spirit stones to restore his energy, sharing them with his clone.  While recovering, he carefully examined the deceased’s storage pouch.</p><p>The number of magical artifacts, elixirs, talismans, and otherworldly items inside was surprisingly small, hardly matching the deceased's cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the deceased had devoted himself to cultivating the Gu King, refining his poisonous arts, and managing the intense poison within his body.  Later, after the Gu King reached its peak, he obtained the Red Profound Ancient Tree, practiced the Innate Wooden Man Stele, and prepared to open the Legacy Mansion of the Unseen Immortal Sect, leaving him little time for anything else.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense activated the storage pouch, releasing several beams of light.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed a wooden box.</p><p>Opening the box, he found a mass of green light.  His spiritual sense swept over it, and the method of refining the Heavenly Linglong was imprinted in his mind.  This secret technique, not passed down from the Wood Aspect Hall, was finally his.</p><p>The refining method was exceptionally complete, containing the insights of successive masters of the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Witnessing it firsthand, he realized the refinement of the Heavenly Linglong wasn't as easy as the deceased had claimed.</p><p>The refiner must first have a profound mastery of the art of refining weapons and a cultivation base no lower than the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This treasure aids in reaching the Transformation God stage, its value beyond imagination.</p><p>However, even if someone could refine the Heavenly Linglong and sell it, they would still need to carefully weigh the risks and rewards—a testament to the extreme difficulty of creating it.</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Linglong is not a matter of days or months, and the required materials are extremely rare heavenly treasures.  Even Qin Sang, a master refiner, didn't recognize several of them.</p><p>The other beams of light contained jade slips, some of which held the refining techniques of the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>During the Unseen Immortal Sect's heyday, the Wood Aspect Hall was renowned for its weapon refining.  These techniques would undoubtedly greatly aid Qin Sang, allowing him to make rapid progress in the art of weapon refining once he had time to dedicate himself to it. This was an unexpected bonus.</p><p>Unbelievably, the Unseen Immortal Sect's alchemy and weapon refining techniques had both fallen into his hands.</p><p>Using the contents of the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of those unfamiliar materials. He could find some with patience, but others would depend on pure luck.</p><p>One material in particular, a substance called Moon Laurel Celestial Dew, was exceptionally rare, originating from the Celestial桂秘境 of the Heavenly Unity Hall, accessible only once every few hundred years.</p><p>The deceased had failed to find the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew in the Wood Aspect Hall.</p><p>Now that the Heavenly Palace had ascended, access to the Celestial桂秘境 was impossible. Where could he find it?</p><p>The Heavenly Linglong refinement method didn’t contain this information, deliberately omitted by the deceased, otherwise the Weeping Spirit Cave Master wouldn't be so optimistic.</p><p>There were exceptions, however. A Nascent Soul cultivator of the Unseen Immortal Sect, while traveling in the outer regions of the Storm Belt, stumbled upon an ancient cultivator's legacy mansion and found a small vial of it.</p><p>It might still exist in this world, hidden within some unknown ancient cultivator's legacy mansion.</p><p>Since Qin Sang possessed five elemental spiritual roots, the Heavenly Linglong was useless to him. Still, this discovery was somewhat disappointing.  With the materials incomplete, the value of this secret technique was significantly reduced, and he needed to think carefully about maximizing his gains.</p><p>The deceased had withheld this information not only from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the last beam of light and gently beckoned.</p><p>The light settled into his hand, revealing a crystalline jade orb.  About the size of a baby's fist, it emitted a pure, verdant light, shining brightly like a night pearl.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Linglong!</p><p>However, it was an unfinished spiritual embryo.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, seeing imperfections through the green light.</p><p>The surface of the orb wasn't smooth, containing countless tiny cavities, so small they were almost imperceptible without careful observation.</p><p>Each cavity was inscribed with countless restrictions, their precision unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen; perhaps few treasures in this world could compare, and this was only the first layer.</p><p>The Heavenly Linglong could be considered five nested jade orbs.</p><p>All five layers were equally intricate.</p><p>Upon completion, the five jade orbs must be fused into one, their energies in perfect balance, with no conflict.</p><p>Further observation revealed that the Heavenly Linglong was not entirely solid, existing between reality and illusion, capable of merging with any type of innate magical artifact.</p><p>The Wood Aspect Hall master had created the embryo and placed it in the workshop, nurturing it with the hall's unique refining spirit array.  Later, a great war broke out, the master perished, and the treasure remained in the hall, gathering dust, unknown to all.</p><p>Upon discovering it, the deceased was overjoyed.  While the embryo was far from complete, at least he no longer needed to worry about the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew.</p><p>Even if he'd found more than one, he wouldn't easily give them away, not to the Cryptic Cave Master.</p><p>The alchemic inheritance of the Wooden Phase Hall and the Sky-Lingering Spirit Embryo alone were worth the cost of a single Boiling Snow Pill, let alone that Qin Sang had paid almost nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly said he was lucky, carefully storing the treasures. He activated his spatial pouch and three more beams of light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a broken branch.</p><p>The token was the Wooden Phase Token.</p><p>After searching the soul of the Cryptic Cave Master, Qin Sang learned that the Five Phase Tokens seemed to have a significant role to play at the Imperial Mandate Mountain.  He didn't understand the reason, so he put it away for later observation.</p><p>The wooden armor was frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light. After the grotesque-faced man's death, it fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>This treasure was undoubtedly a powerful defensive artifact, but it needed to have the grotesque-faced man's aura removed and then be carefully refined before it could be used.  He set it aside with the broken branch.</p><p>The broken branch was from the Crimson Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>When the grotesque-faced man self-destructed his spiritual wood body, the spirit tree disintegrated.  Its essence remained, with a portion surviving, but the spirit tree had been refined by the grotesque-faced man for many years, tainted with his aura, and could only be used for refining artifacts in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the grotesque-faced man's abilities: the spiritual wood body and the poison needles.</p><p>Continuing to search, he finally found a piece of dead wood in the spatial pouch.</p><p>The dead wood was less than a foot long and as thick as a wrist, entirely black, clearly a completely rotten piece of wood.  His spiritual sense detected nothing unusual.</p><p>In another place, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>But when he carefully searched with his spiritual sense and touched the almost imperceptible point of light at the core of the dead wood, he realized there was more to it!</p><p>The dead wood contained several inheritances of the Wooden Phase Hall, likely left behind by a descendant.</p><p>The inheritances included the grotesque-faced man's fundamental cultivation technique, "Wood Emperor Strategy," and its corresponding abilities, as well as the "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" that Qin Sang had been thinking about!</p><p>To cultivate these abilities, one needs to find spirit wood and cultivate a spirit wood body, allowing one to become as powerful as the grotesque-faced man, comparable to a body cultivator.</p><p>In a forest rich in wood spirit aura, one's body becomes like a divine stele, rooted in place, their aura connected to all trees, absorbing wood spirit energy for comprehensive enhancement, greatly increasing both strength and recovery capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, "No wonder the grotesque-faced man was so difficult to deal with after his transformation."</p><p>The grotesque-faced man only had a minor accomplishment in these abilities.  The full potential held many incredible abilities, but even a Nascent Soul cultivator would find it difficult to reach the peak.</p><p>Furthermore, the improvements brought by the Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele were also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>After reading this, Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at his external avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Performance Dao Tree could make Bai lose composure.  What kind of spirit tree had a higher rank than the Performance Dao Tree?</p><p>However, to refine the Performance Dao Tree into a spirit wood body and integrate it into himself, he would have to restore the Performance Dao Tree to its original form, abandoning his external avatar; such a trade-off was difficult to make.</p><p>The "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" had great potential, enhancing his own body, but the external avatar had the ability to die and be reborn, and it had already consumed a great deal of his energy and resources.</p><p>Refining a spirit wood body was no easy task either.</p><p>His external avatar was about to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, its potential might not be inferior to the spirit wood body, and the ability to die and be reborn was a divine ability he couldn't give up.</p><p>Even with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, Qin Sang didn't dare to claim invincibility.</p><p>Sighing softly, he decided to put aside these troublesome matters for now, and put the dead wood away. Then he took out a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the complete "Gu Manual" of the Myriad Poisons Mountain.</p><p>The latter half of the Gu Manual didn't record the method of cultivating Gu Kings, but from the descriptions, it was clear that the Gu King and the Gu Manual were of the same origin.</p><p>The Gu King must be the core secret of the Myriad Poisons Mountain.  Qin Sang didn't understand how the grotesque-faced man got it and even managed to obtain part of Myriad Poison Mountain’s inheritance.</p><p>No wonder Myriad Poisons Mountain hated him so much.</p><p>The back of the "Gu Manual" recorded several poison-based abilities, with the "Heaven's Extinction Soul-Destroying Needle" being the strongest.</p><p>The name, implying that the poison needles would destroy all living beings and ghosts between heaven and earth, was incredibly ambitious, and its power was worthy of the name.</p><p>Cultivating this ability required a highly potent poison, but one must be careful not to rush the process of refining the poison, otherwise, the poison would invade one's internal organs, killing the cultivator before they mastered the technique.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this ability.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze from the Gu Manual to the demonic fire floating in the cave, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>After the Gu King devoured its master, the red color on its body gradually faded, almost returning to its original jade-white color, but its fierce nature hadn't weakened; instead, it had become even more violent.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King, so he had been using the demonic fire as a prison, keeping it confined.  After reading the "Gu Manual" and the grotesque-faced man's collection, he still hadn't found a way to subdue the Gu King.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>Wan Du Mountain dared to reveal this information, confident that even if he killed the Strange-faced Man, he couldn't subdue the Gu King and would have to trade with Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>The Gu King's poisonous light is extraordinary, and its inherent rank is also extremely high, making it invaluable.</p><p>"What will Wan Du Mountain offer in exchange?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but didn't hold out much hope.</p><p>If possible, he preferred to subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon.  He at least wanted to consult with Gui Mu before considering a trade.</p><p>But his current plan to enter Di Shou Mountain wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a while, his mind stirred.</p><p>The fat silkworm's poison pearl could counter the Heaven-Severing Soul-Slaying Needle, so could it be used to suppress the Gu King's ferocity?  During his time at Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, making it obedient would suffice.</p><p>Thinking it through, he acted.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind on his dantian, activating the poison pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored rays burst from his dantian, and the poison pearl slowly flew out towards the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the poison pearl's aura,</p><p>the Gu King's wingbeats suddenly stopped. It turned, its bloodshot eyes fixed on the poison pearl, as if facing a formidable enemy, then let out a sharper, more urgent buzzing sound.</p><p>"Good, it's reacting…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. After a brief thought, he directly sent the poison pearl through the demonic fire, placing it before the Gu King.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Immediately, a beam of poisonous light shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang, not daring to be too reckless, controlled the poison pearl to evade, allowing only the edge of the poisonous light to touch it.</p><p>Suddenly, the poison pearl dissipated into mist, the poisonous light passing right through.</p><p>Then, the poison pearl reformed, completely unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang checked it, relieved, and guided the poison pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings vibrated wildly, spraying poisonous light, but it couldn't hit Qin Sang or destroy the poison pearl. Instead, the demonic fire gradually compressed its movement, pushing the poison pearl closer.</p><p>Soon, the poison pearl floated above the Gu King's head.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The poison pearl transformed into a stream of anti-poison light, seemingly about to engulf the Gu King.</p><p>The next moment, the Gu King was surrounded by the light, its faint outline still visible through the light.  However, once the light approached a certain distance, it couldn't advance further. The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint bloody light, forming a protective aura, and it darted out of the light.</p><p>The attempt failed, but Qin Sang's face wasn't dejected, but rather surprised, as if he'd discovered something unexpected.</p><p>He continued to control the poison pearl, repeating the process.</p><p>He tried dozens of times, all ending in failure.</p><p>But the surprise in Qin Sang's eyes deepened; he'd made a startling discovery.</p><p>Each time the poison pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang felt that the poison pearl seemed to intensely crave the Gu King, intending to devour it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this feeling wasn't a delusion.</p><p>He remembered that the fat silkworm, after its fourth transformation, could directly devour Gu insects. He had even cultivated some, allowing it to feast. The Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those Gu insects.</p><p>The poison pearl extracted from it had inherited its devouring ability!</p><p>"If the poison pearl devours the Gu King, could it continue to improve?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered this possibility, his eyes instantly filled with eagerness.</p><p>The anti-poison ability was somewhat limited; once used, it showed considerable effectiveness.</p><p>Qin Sang always believed external objects were inferior to oneself.  The poison pearl was closely connected to him, a part of himself. If he allowed the poison pearl to continuously devour poisons, what kind of transformation would it undergo in the future?</p><p>The Gu King's intelligence was low; in terms of potential, it was clearly inferior to the poison pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the poison pearl couldn't subdue the Gu King. How could he get the Gu King to be willingly devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, reviewing various classics, and studying the *Gu Classic* again. Until his true energy was almost restored and it was time to leave, he hadn't found a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration and slapped his hand.</p><p>Since the art of insect control wouldn't work, why not start with its master?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what methods the Strange-faced Man used to suppress the Gu King. But he knew the Strange-faced Man's fundamental skill was the *Wood Emperor Strategy*, which harmonized with the Wood Dao.</p><p>The Gu King was always by the Strange-faced Man's side, perhaps fearing this aura.</p><p>However, before letting his avatar try, Qin Sang withdrew his spirit back to his Purple Mansion, returning to his primordial spirit.</p><p>Since merging with Yun Youzi's Jiao Mu true spirit, the Yun You Sword, never used before, made its debut!</p><p>A flash from his brow.</p><p>A beam of azure light instantly illuminated the cave!</p><p>"Old friend, it's your turn…"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a mix of emotion, with a touch of sadness, and pointed at the Gu King.</p><p>The Yun You Sword, integrated with the ten great sacred trees, was considered a treasure of the Wood Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't using the Yun You Sword to kill the Gu King; he wouldn't worry about harming the true spirit. Instead, he was using the purest Wood Dao treasure's sword intent to awe the Gu King.</p><p>If successful, he could retract the poison pearl, Gu King, and Yun You Sword into his body, maintaining this state until the poison pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
