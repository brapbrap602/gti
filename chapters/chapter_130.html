<h1>Chapter 123: Escaping the Spirit Formula</h1><p>Given the Flying Shuttle, that Imperfect Wind Under the Heavens, which allows one to only rise two zhang above the ground, seems mediocre and could be given to the white cat. Furthermore, as the white cat is a demon, it doesn’t dare to fly above human cultivators’ territory, and only uses Imperfect Wind Under the Heavens to escape in times of danger; it suits her well.</p><p>The Azure Wave Sword could be sent to her too; Qin Sang only uses the Azure Wave Sword as a facade right now, and could exchange it for a Bloodblade later without much impact.</p><p>It’s a pity that the Bewitching Mirror had been destroyed by Sun De; otherwise, the Bewitching Mirror, Imperfect Wind Under the Heavens, and the Azure Wave Sword, these three magical artifacts should satisfy the white cat.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly came up with something, his eyes instantly lighting up, and said, “I can give you a formula that can conceal demon aura.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, the white cat was overjoyed at first, and then asked with doubt, “Young master, do you really have a formula that can conceal demon aura?”</p><p>Before a demon clan can completely transform into humans, there will be a unique demon-like aura on their body; in the immortal cultivation world, this is called demon aura. The reason why cat demons don’t dare to go wandering around is that they’re afraid that human immortal cultivators will differentiate them through their demon aura.</p><p>The fur, bones, and blood of demonic beasts make for high-grade refining materials; in particular, the white cat is already at the later stages of the Mortal Demon period. After taking its body, and adding other valuable spiritual objects, if one asks a refining master to get involved, then refining a superb-grade magical artifact shouldn’t be too difficult; as long as an immortal cultivator is not too weak, they surely must have thoughts about it.</p><p>If the white cat were to accidentally expose its tracks in human cultivators’ territory and become besieged, then even the Azure Bamboo Rod wouldn’t be able to save its life.</p><p>But demon aura is not something that can be concealed so easily; otherwise, demonic beasts would’ve already run rampant. Even though the white cat’s intelligence is not inferior to humans, it finds it difficult to completely withdraw its demon aura; once it gets close to immortal cultivators, it will reveal its flaws.</p><p>Because of this, it didn’t believe that Qin Sang just so happened to have a formula suitable for the demon clan that could also conceal their demon aura.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, “I wouldn’t lie to you; this formula is called Escaping the Spirit Formula, and was obtained from Gu Tiannan’s body, but I don’t know who developed it. Gu Tiannan was not only able to conceal his cultivation level, but also completely hide all of the demonic aura on his body; he relies on this formula. As long as one can manipulate spiritual force, they can cultivate this formula. It not only conceals demonic aura, but also works on demon aura, demonic aura, and aggressive aura; your demon clan can also use it.”</p><p>There were two formulas in Gu Tiannan’s jade slip: one was called the Blood Pellet Secret Technique, and the other was this formula, Escaping the Spirit Formula, to conceal one’s aura. These two formulas complemented each other.</p><p>The Blood Pellet Secret Technique doesn’t sound like a righteous arcane method; after Qin Sang looked through it, he was even more shocked. This was a very cruel, evil technique; it not only harmed others, but also caused harm to oneself!</p><p>Escaping the Spirit Formula, however, was a formula for pure restraint of one’s aura; its effect is much more powerful than the few restraining aura spells from Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Escaping the Spirit Formula and the Blood Pellet Secret Technique are not in the same vein, and should have been a formula found elsewhere by the creator of the Blood Pellet Secret Technique in fear of others discovering that they cultivate an evil technique.</p><p>However, judging from Qin Sang’s perspective, the true objective of the creator of Escaping the Spirit Formula probably wasn’t to conceal their cultivation level.</p><p>Gu Tiannan concealed his demonic aura using Escaping the Spirit Formula. Even if he was facing a monk in the middling stages of the Foundation Establishment period, he still had a great chance of getting away with it. It’s the most suitable for the white cat.</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang took out that jade slip from his Mustard Seed Bag, and then took out a blank jade slip and copied out a part of Escaping the Spirit Formula.</p><p>Just as he was about to throw the jade slip to the white cat, Qin Sang’s movements suddenly stopped, and he lightly said, “Miss Bai, shouldn’t you also show your sincerity?”</p><p>Through the words, Qin Sang could tell that although the white cat was very clever, it has still been cultivating while hidden in the cave after all; it’s still inexperienced, and isn’t well-trained in the ways of the world; those words that it spoke should be around 80–90% true.</p><p>However, the spiritual eye is of great importance to him. In order to be absolutely certain, Qin Sang decided to be a bit more cautious, so as to avoid the white cat from taking the jade slip and running.</p><p>The white cat naturally very much anticipated the Escaping the Spirit Formula in the jade slip, but upon hearing Qin Sang’s words, it began to hesitate once more and was unable to make a decision.</p><p>Qin Sang also knew that this request was a bit excessive for the white cat.</p><p>After all, the cave cannot be moved; letting Qin Sang know its location, if he were to renege, and gather a group of helpers to come over, the white cat, without any assistance, could only run away, and hand over the cave entrance.</p><p>“How about this, there’s originally your contribution in obtaining this formula; I’ll give you two more magical artifacts.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Azure Wave Sword and Divination Topographic Map from his Mustard Seed Bag, and also spat out that Imperfect Wind Under the Heavens, and handed them all to the white cat, while patiently explaining their uses.</p><p>"This geomantic map is the treasure of Lesser Mount Hua. It marks the locations of all the immortal sects, great and small, all the way to the border of Heavenly Demon Mound. As long as you avoid encountering any disciples, even if you run into a few freelance cultivators, you should be fine. This ball of wind is called Voidwind, and it is a high-grade magic weapon. If you refine it, you can ride it to escape from danger, and there are few Qi Condensation cultivators who would be able to catch you. The Azurewave Sword is also a high-grade magic weapon, the power of which you have already witnessed. With these three items, plus the Escaping Spirit Art, and some healing elixirs and life-saving spirit seals, that shall surely be enough in exchange for your cave dwelling, yes?"</p><p>Qin Sang has exhausted all his resources. If the white cat is still not satisfied, he would at most offer her all the spirit seals and elixirs on his person.</p><p>However, even if it meant being totally cleaned out, Qin Sang still thought it was worth it to exchange for a cave dwelling that was built on a spirit eye.</p><p>The white cat happily embraced all of these items, caressing that, touching this, unable to put them down, her eyes slightly narrowed, with a faint purring sound coming from her throat.</p><p>After finally glancing at the jade slip carrying the geomantic map, the white cat wagged her tail and said cheerfully, "This map is far more detailed and covers a much larger area compared to the one I had before. It even marks out the dangers in the vastness of the Clearcloud Marshes. This is wonderful! I shall lead you to my cave dwelling now. I hope you do not deceive me."</p><p>Before leaving, they did not forget about those mortals—the white cat lifted the restrictions she had cast upon them, while Qin Sang condensed a ball of fresh water and dissolved a spiritual pill in it before feeding a couple of drops to each of them.</p><p>The complexions of these people turned rosy at a speed visible to the naked eye. After recovering their vigor, it would not be long before they woke up.</p><p>Qin Sang did his utmost to obliterate the traces of the cultivators' battle, carried the unconscious Gu Yuan, and followed the white cat as they flew toward her cave dwelling.</p><p>South of the Kingdom of Guyuan was the Clearcloud Marshes. The white cat's cave dwelling was on an insignificant, deserted island in the marshes. Beneath this deserted island was a spiritual vein hidden deep within the Clearcloud Marshes. This spiritual vein was not extensive, but the spiritual energy it contained was pure, and it had happened to form a spirit eye at the bottom of the deserted island.</p><p>The bamboo demon that had enlightened the white cat set up an array that sealed this spirit eye so that its spiritual energy would not leak out. Unless someone dug a hole all the way to the bottom of the deserted island, it would be absolutely impossible to discover the existence of this cave dwelling.</p><p>The entrance to the cave dwelling was a stone crevice naturally formed among the reefs at the bottom of the deserted island. Qin Sang followed the white cat into the cave dwelling and immediately felt the extremely dense spiritual energy. This was truly a spirit eye.</p>
