<h1>Chapter 1724: Never Betray</h1><p>The river snaked through the landscape, villages nestled along its banks.</p><p>Compared to other parts of the Southern Continent, this area was relatively populous.</p><p>Reverence for the Dao and Buddha flourished in the mortal world, and even in this remote region, there stood a Buddhist nunnery named Lianxi Abbey, where nuns practiced their faith.</p><p>The name 'Lianxi' was derived from the Lianxi River.</p><p>Lianxi Abbey was a temple of the mortal realm; the nuns within were all mortals. No tales of the supernatural surrounded the abbey, and the nearby villagers offered incense and prayers simply for peace of mind.</p><p>Qin Sang landed by the riverbank, standing still as he focused inward.</p><p>The Poison Pearl revolved slowly within his dantian.</p><p>Seven-colored radiance swirled around it, yet it appeared somewhat dim.</p><p>Inside the Poison Pearl, another black pearl resided. Upon closer inspection, one could see that this pearl wasn't a solid object but composed of smoky qi â€“ the venomous power of the Myriad Poison Mountain's sacred relic.</p><p>Qin Sang had promised the Poison King the essence of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's poison in exchange for this venomous smoke.</p><p>The idea of merging the Gu King with the venomous power of the sacred relic to recreate the essence of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's poison was merely a concept envisioned by the ancestor of Myriad Poison Mountain, remaining unverified until now.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the true teachings of Myriad Poison Mountain and couldn't control the sacred relic. However, with the aid of the Poison Pearl, he succeeded. In less than half a year at Myriad Poison Mountain, he made progress, merging the first wisp of the essence and fulfilling his promise to the Poison King.</p><p>Refining the essence wasn't easy. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, it couldn't be accomplished overnight. He had the Poison King extract the venomous power of the sacred relic, sealed it within the Poison Pearl, and brought it out for gradual refinement.</p><p>This time, he had overdrawn the sacred relic's essence even more severely than before, as his old injuries hadn't fully healed. After returning it to the forbidden grounds, it remained motionless like an insect corpse, and it was unknown how long it would take to recover.</p><p>With the essence of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's poison, the Poison King could verify his cultivation method and strive for Deity Transformation. Furthermore, with his insights, future generations of Myriad Poison Mountain would also benefit.</p><p>In the past, even a thousand years of slumber for the sacred relic would have been gladly accepted.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, glanced up at the small temple on the mountaintop, and walked up the mountain path. Along the way, he encountered only two other pilgrims, indicating that Lianxi Abbey wasn't particularly popular.</p><p>Behind Lianxi Abbey lay Yanyue Nunnery, the secular branch of Yanyue Nunnery. To visit Yanyue Nunnery, one had to request permission from the Abbess of Lianxi Abbey.</p><p>Due to its connection with the Formless Immortal Sect, Yanyue Nunnery was forced into seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang knew of the relationship between Lianxi Abbey and Yanyue Nunnery thanks to Liu Li's guidance.</p><p>The Abbess of Lianxi Abbey seemed to know something. Upon seeing Qin Sang, before he could reveal his identity or background, she respectfully bowed and invited him to sit, then went to the back hall.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't extend his divine sense, but waited patiently for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. Sensing a familiar aura approaching, he rose and saw an old nun enter.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that this old nun was the current Abbess of Yanyue Nunnery, Grandmaster Yun Xin.</p><p>"Greetings, Divine Nun Yun Xin."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward and bowed deeply. "I am grateful for your assistance years ago, which saved me from peril. I apologize for not having thanked you in person before."</p><p>Grandmaster Yun Xin hastily returned the bow. "True Monarch Qin is too kind. I did very little. It was my junior sister who rescued you regardless of the consequences, and it was also my junior sister who intercepted the Demon King. True Monarch Qin has gifted us with numerous invaluable secret manuals, from which we have greatly benefited. I have always felt unworthy of such generosity. Moreover, I heard that True Monarch Qin cleared the name of the Formless Immortal Sect at the Grand Ceremony, allowing future generations to see the light of day again. It is I who should thank True Monarch Qin..."</p><p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries and praise,</p><p>the relationship between the two became considerably closer.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind Grandmaster Yun Xin, noticing no one else had accompanied her.</p><p>Grandmaster Yun Xin keenly perceived Qin Sang's gaze and immediately invited him to Yanyue Nunnery, adding, "Junior Sister Liu Li is currently in secluded cultivation. I have already sent someone to inform her, and I believe she should be out by now."</p><p>Yanyue Nunnery was situated deep within desolate mountains.</p><p>Following Grandmaster Yun Xin, Qin Sang flew for a while, faintly sensing a shift in the surrounding spiritual energy. His eyes flickered, but he remained silent. Then, the mountain scenery ahead transformed, shadows of trees swaying as a few tranquil temple buildings appeared.</p><p>Seated in a stone pavilion within the temple, Qin Sang and Grandmaster Yun Xin discussed the matter of the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Half a year had passed since the Grand Ceremony. The news Qin Sang announced had spread throughout the cultivation world, from the Northern Wasteland to the Southern Sea, from the Eastern Sea to the Western Desert, shaking the entire Central Continent.</p><p>Sects and factions of all sizes, even rogue cultivators, were searching for the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Major sects with Grandmasters leading them were the most diligent, having searched their own forbidden grounds countless times.</p><p>Alternatively, the search for the Ascension Platform could also start with ancient demons. Ancient demons like Ghost Mother, whose cultivation was sealed and thus unaffected by the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers, might still be lingering somewhere.</p><p>Ancient demons certainly knew the location of the Ascension Platform.</p><p>It was necessary to first locate places of demonic confinement, similar to ancient cultivators' hidden realms. Ordinary individuals shouldn't act rashly, lest they release the demonic beings within.</p><p>Grandmaster Xing Ji and others were stationed in the Central Plains, collecting information from all directions, and had contacted the Dragon Whale Great Sage of the Eastern Sea's demon race, exchanging their respective knowledge of ancient secrets.</p><p>For the human and demon races of this world, for all sects and factions, regardless of their traditions, to cooperate in such a manner was truly an unprecedented phenomenon.</p><p>From land to deep sea, the footprints of cultivators covered this world.</p><p>Although the Ascension Platform hadn't been found, they had unexpectedly discovered some unknown secret realms, granting immense opportunities to those with great fortune.</p><p>However, too few descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect dared to reveal themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to ask Grandmaster Yun Xin to contact these individuals, as Yanyue Nunnery should have connections with some of them.</p><p>Grandmaster Yun Xin readily agreed.</p><p>As they were talking, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Grandmaster Yun Xin sensed it too and rose with a smile. "I have just remembered something and must excuse myself for a moment. Please wait a while, True Monarch..."</p><p>"Please, feel free, Divine Nun."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly.</p><p>As soon as Grandmaster Yun Xin left, a female Buddhist practitioner appeared at the end of the stone steps outside the pavilion, walking from the mist. She wore a Haiqing robe, a Buddhist cap covering her dark hair but unable to conceal her exquisite beauty.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, silently watching the woman until she reached the pavilion.</p><p>Behind a distant tree, young nuns peeked curiously. Seeing the scene, one couldn't help but giggle, only to have her mouth covered by her companion, who dragged her away, adding a touch of liveliness to the picturesque mountain scenery.</p><p>"Congratulations on achieving Deity Transformation, Fellow Daoist," Liu Li said, gazing deeply at Qin Sang, a rare ripple of emotion in her voice, as if sighing.</p><p>The circumstances of their first meeting were hardly elegant.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had just established his Foundation, achieved through trading himself for Foundation Establishment spiritual medicine, while Liu Li was just a step away from Nascent Soul. The disparity between them was more than just a world of difference.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang was forced to leave. When they met again, his cultivation had already surpassed hers.</p><p>Now, the gap was widening even further.</p><p>Liu Li couldn't fathom how someone with five spiritual roots could reach this level, what kind of unwavering determination it took to get to where he was today.</p><p>"Congratulations to you as well, Fairy, on breaking through to Late Nascent Soul."</p><p>Qin Sang hastily returned the greeting.</p><p>He had been thinking about how to broach the topic of the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers.</p><p>Liu Li's experiences were the opposite of his; the hardships she endured were no less than his.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, his path was arduous, while Liu Li's was smooth.</p><p>After Nascent Soul, the effects of his cultivation method and the Jade Buddha manifested, making his cultivation journey relatively smooth, while Liu Li was trapped by the brand of her demonic cultivation, facing numerous trials.</p><p>With unwavering resolve, Liu Li tirelessly fought against the brand, and her persistence finally paid off as she found a way out through Buddhist teachings. Yet, the demonic whispers blocked her path, almost severing the path of immortality in this world.</p><p>Fate was too cruel!</p><p>The two sat facing each other in the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, creating a barrier around the pavilion to prevent prying eyes.</p><p>From inside the pavilion, everything outside appeared normal, but those outside could only see a black curtain.</p><p>Liu Li tilted her head slightly, her eyes questioning him.</p><p>"Has Fairy forgotten her vow to save her master?"</p><p>Qin Sang started with a rhetorical question.</p><p>Based on his understanding of Liu Li, rescuing her master was her lifelong obsession, for which she even resorted to cultivating a dual cultivation demonic art. How could she possibly forget?</p><p>Liu Li frowned as expected, but seeing Qin Sang's serious gaze, seemingly waiting for her answer, she replied quietly, "I have not."</p><p>"That's good!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I have already broken through to Deity Transformation. Following convention, after a period of secluded cultivation, I can journey eastward. After ascending, I will do my best to investigate the whereabouts of your master, and if the opportunity arises, I will also help rescue her."</p><p>It concerned her master's safety, so Liu Li couldn't refuse. Her lips parted slightly, about to express her gratitude, but Qin Sang interrupted her.</p><p>"However, I would rather see Fairy rescue your master with your own hands. That would truly honor your dedication, and we outsiders cannot be as devoted as you."</p><p>Qin Sang's words seemed a bit strange, as if encouraging her.</p><p>Liu Li didn't need encouragement, but she could see Qin Sang's good intentions. "I won't slack off," she said.</p><p>"I believe in your unwavering resolve, Fairy. With your talent, you have the confidence to strive for Deity Transformation, but life is unpredictable..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, no longer hesitating, and revealed the changes in the Heavenly Dao to Liu Li.</p><p>He held nothing back, explaining the threat of the demonic whispers and all his speculations about the heavenly changes.</p><p>Silence filled the stone pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang watched her quietly, without speaking.</p><p>Liu Li kept her head lowered, gazing at the stone table between them, her expression hidden. After an unknown amount of time, she finally looked up, her expression and tone as cold as ever. "Because of the heavenly changes, you're looking for the Ascension Platform."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Liu Li's willpower was truly extraordinary; facing such a blow, she hadn't lost her spirit.</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded. "But we must consider, what if there's only one Ascension Platform?"</p><p>Liu Li's lips twitched slightly.</p><p>She knew her own situation best. She had made progress in suppressing the demonic brand with Buddhist teachings, otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to break through to Late Nascent Soul so smoothly. However, the brand hadn't been completely removed, the hidden danger still remained. Others might still have a sliver of hope, but with the demonic whispers, the Heart Demon Tribulation, and the brand all attacking at once, she had no chance of survival.</p><p>"Do you still remember what Senior Ghost Mother said?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly asked a seemingly irrelevant question.</p><p>Regarding Liu Li's predicament, Ghost Mother had offered four words â€“ channeling is better than blocking.</p><p>Her words to Liu Li back then weren't so direct, but they implied the same meaning.</p><p>Liu Li's eyes flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang continued, as if lamenting, "Cultivators talk about transcendence all the time, viewing emotions and desires as obstacles to cultivation. Some even fear them like tigers. But in my opinion, true cultivation is to be neither bound by emotions nor by the absence of them. What does Fairy think?"</p><p>Liu Li stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't flinch, meeting her gaze. The Thousand Jun Ring glimmered, and two objects flew out, coincidentally both half-formed spiritual embryos.</p><p>One was the Heavenly Exquisite Spirit Embryo.</p><p>The other was a Superior Soul-Calming Incense Embryo.</p><p>"If we can't find the Ascension Platform, the Return to Ruin is inevitable. The Azure Fox Saint King is my enemy, and the Wise Light Venerable has also schemed against me. I'm alone and need allies... Fairy is the only person I can absolutely trust in this world. Helping you is helping myself."</p><p>Qin Sang placed the two treasures on the stone table.</p><p>Under the influence of the demonic whispers, even ordinary people faced a slim chance of surviving the Heart Demon Tribulation, let alone Liu Li. To help her reach Deity Transformation, these two treasures were clearly insufficient.</p><p>He also needed to address the demonic brand.</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering this matter, but any attempt required Liu Li's willing cooperation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't force her to accept immediately.</p><p>After placing the treasures, Qin Sang continued, "Don't rush to refuse, Fairy. I intend to unite the cultivators of this world and journey westward soon, touring all the regions and investigating the edge of the Return to Ruin once more. Sixty years might not be enough. These two treasures will be temporarily kept at Yanyue Nunnery. During this time, I hope Fairy will think carefully before making a decision."</p><p>Refining the Heavenly Exquisite might still be possible, but gathering all the spiritual herbs required for the Superior Soul-Calming Incense was unlikely to be achievable by Liu Li alone.</p><p>Qin Sang would also search for them during his travels.</p><p>Leaving behind the two treasures was a way to show Liu Li his determination.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, as long as Liu Li accepted him and they worked together, there were no insurmountable obstacles!</p><p>Even in the worst-case scenario, if the demonic brand couldn't be removed and Liu Li truly became a Mystic Maiden, as long as she could reach Deity Transformation and ascend, it would be worthwhile.</p><p>The vast world held endless mysteries, and they could search for a solution later.</p><p>Of course, different people had different convictions. Qin Sang couldn't impose his own thoughts on Liu Li; he could only let her understand on her own.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang pressed his hand on the stone table, stood up, and without a second glance, turned to leave the pavilion. Reaching the outside, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>"Fairy should be aware of my character. If Fairy can let go of your inner burdens, regardless of whether the brand can ultimately be removed, I have only one thing to say..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his back to Liu Li, gazing at the vast land beyond the mountains.</p><p>It was early morning, golden light surging in the east as the sun was about to rise.</p><p>"No matter what, I will never betray you!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bid farewell to Grandmaster Yun Xin either, but strode down the mountain, his robes fluttering.  Just then, the rising sun peeked over the distant mountains, and the dazzling golden light outlined Qin Sang's retreating figure, imprinting it in Liu Li's eyes.</p><p>The eight words resonated powerfully, echoing in the pavilion.</p><p>Inside the pavilion.</p><p>Two treasures that would drive anyone in the world mad lay before Liu Li, but she didn't even glance at them.  She fixated on Qin Sang's retreating figure until he disappeared into the mountain mist.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew, rustling the leaves outside the pavilion.  All was silent.</p><p>...</p><p>Ever since Qin Sang arrived, the nuns of Yanyue Nunnery had been paying attention to the stone pavilion.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang leave so abruptly, without even saying goodbye, they were all surprised, including Grandmaster Yun Xin.</p><p>Back then, Liu Li risked her life to save True Monarch Qin, and judging by True Monarch Qin's actions, he wasn't without feelings for Liu Li.</p><p>Moreover, both of them possessed exceptional talent and were so well-matched; they shouldn't repeat the tragedy of their ancestors.</p><p>They had thought they would witness a beautiful union.</p><p>"What happened? Go check on Junior Sister..."</p><p>A nun, anxious, rushed towards the pavilion, only to be stopped by Grandmaster Yun Xin, who sent everyone back to the nunnery.</p><p>...</p><p>Leaving Yanyue Nunnery,</p><p>Qin Sang chose a random mountaintop and sat cross-legged, facing the rising sun, absorbing the purple qi. After a long period of meditation, he rose and continued his journey.</p><p></p>
