<h1>Chapter 602: The Verdigris Shard</h1><p>Chapter 602: The Verdigris Shard</p><p>Nine Illusion Sky Orchid and Three Light Jade Liquid are incredibly valuable treasures, enough to drive cultivators mad.  Even Dao companions might turn on each other for them.  Having supported each other many times in the past, Yun Youzi and he shared a deep friendship.  Now, this friendship faces a test from these rare treasures—will it change?</p><p>Qin Sang hoped Yun Youzi wouldn't disappoint him.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the edge of the South Bright Fiery Fire, summoned his ebony sword, prepared himself, and watched Yun Youzi's movements.</p><p>Yun Youzi sat cross-legged in the center of the spirit array, his expression solemn.  He held a small bird spirit puppet in his palm, extending it towards the South Bright Fiery Fire.</p><p>Under Yun Youzi's control, the green light in the spirit array gathered onto the bird puppet, finally merging into its body.  Simultaneously, the bird puppet spread its wings, hopping on Yun Youzi's palm.  It opened its beak wide, greedily absorbing the essence of the South Bright Fiery Fire.</p><p>During this process, the bird puppet's bones and feathers became increasingly red, as if flames were truly burning within it, spreading outwards until it enveloped the entire bird.  After a final chirp, it vanished, truly transforming into a ball of fire!</p><p>Having absorbed the essence of the South Bright Fiery Fire, it was now assimilated. The flames on the bird puppet were almost identical to the true South Bright Fiery Fire.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Yun Youzi lightly shook his hand.</p><p>The bird puppet spread its wings and shot towards the South Bright Fiery Fire like an arrow, instantly submerging into the flames. It chose a spot close to the passage wall, where the South Bright Fiery Fire was weakest.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Upon entering the South Bright Fiery Fire, the bird puppet wasn't immediately incinerated.</p><p>A shadowy bird appeared deep within the flames.</p><p>The South Bright Fiery Fire essence it had absorbed over the years took effect, helping it integrate with the main fire after being released. However, this integration wouldn't last long; the essence within the bird puppet was rapidly depleting.</p><p>Years of accumulation were still no match for the burning of the South Bright Fiery Fire itself.  Once this essence was exhausted, the bird puppet would perish.</p><p>The bird puppet's body was shrinking visibly; it could only last ten breaths at most.</p><p>The moment the bird puppet entered the South Bright Fiery Fire, Qin Sang also moved, becoming one with his sword and charging forward like a moth to a flame.</p><p>Yun Youzi clenched his hand, shouting, "Open!"</p><p>The bird puppet in the flames flapped its wings violently, dancing in the fire.  Its movements were extraordinarily graceful, yet without the accompaniment of pleasant bird song, there was a poignant beauty in the silence—its final image in the world.</p><p>Using the bird puppet as a guide, Yun Youzi used a small force to move a large mass.</p><p>The edge of the South Bright Fiery Fire, which even Nascent Soul Masters dared not touch, trembled.  A crack appeared between it and the wall.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived just in time and instantly passed through the gap, successfully reaching the other side of the South Bright Fiery Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang brushed past the South Bright Fiery Fire. Before he could feel the terrifying heat of the demonic fire, a wave of icy killing wind enveloped him.</p><p>Instantaneous ice and fire.</p><p>Qin Sang shivered.  His vision ahead was blindingly white. The killing wind seemed to contain shards of ice, coexisting with the South Bright Fiery Fire, creating a bizarre spectacle of ice and fire.</p><p>It was very cold, but not unbearable. The several cold-protection artifacts Qin Sang had prepared weren't even needed.</p><p>The scene ahead showed that the sword-energy killing wind was even more potent than the Xuan Frost Killing Wind. This was likely due to the South Bright Fiery Fire's heat neutralizing the cold.</p><p>However, the extreme chill was still clearly present, unimpeded and directly attacking the soul.  Anyone else would have their soul shattered and frozen to death in a few breaths.</p><p>The closer Qin Sang got to the sword mark and the sword energy's source, the more terrifying the chill became.</p><p>Compared to this, the Xuan Frost Killing Wind was insignificant. Nascent Soul Masters could freely move within the Xuan Frost Killing Wind, but they certainly wouldn't dare to forcefully enter this sword-energy killing wind.</p><p>Time was limited.  Qin Sang briefly surveyed the environment, then widened his eyes, looking ahead.</p><p>The passage indeed ended not far ahead, forming a cliff.  Between the passage's end and his position was a stone chamber, about the same size as the one holding the South Bright Fiery Fire.</p><p>If Yun Youzi's information was correct, the alchemy furnace fragment was inside.</p><p>The stone chamber was also filled with sword-energy killing wind, but Qin Sang was not afraid and immediately rushed towards it.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>The killing wind howled, bringing immense pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang, battling the fierce wind, strained every muscle to reach the stone chamber's entrance and peered inside.</p><p>Sword energy, a raging wind like blades, tore through the chamber.  Clearly, ancient wards protected the stone room from destruction.</p><p>The chamber was empty; anything inside would have been swept away by the sword energy. Yet, at its center, the sword energy formed a vortex, within which a faint green light flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang focused, his gaze piercing the green light to reveal a fist-sized piece of green bronze.</p><p>Just a simple piece of bronze, heavily rusted, without inscriptions or ancient characters. Its edges were sharply broken, like a fragment from a larger bronze object.</p><p>Despite its small size, the bronze felt incredibly heavy, lying stubbornly on the ground, unmoved by the raging wind.</p><p>Only against the backdrop of the sword energy did its extraordinary, ancient aura become apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, sensing no divine aura, fearing his efforts had been in vain.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>His ebony sword hummed, its energy surging as it struck the vortex.</p><p>Qin Sang launched himself forward, exploiting the chaos of the wind, into the vortex's heart, reaching for the bronze.</p><p>Expecting resistance, he was surprised by the bronze's passivity.  He grasped it, feeling a surprising warmth.</p><p>Unaffected by millennia of sword energy erosion, this was how a fragment of a divine artifact should behave!</p><p>Qin Sang silently acknowledged the bronze's extraordinary nature.</p><p>He tried to lift it, but his body lurched—the bronze was far heavier than he anticipated, nearly throwing him off balance.</p><p>"How heavy!" he muttered, quickly pouring more energy into his hand, finally lifting the piece.</p><p>All this took only three breaths.</p><p>Obtaining the bronze was far easier than Yun Youzi had imagined; Qin Sang even had time to search the chamber and examine the piece.</p><p>From his vantage point, the chamber's emptiness was clear—all swept away except the bronze.</p><p>Furthermore, neither spiritual energy nor internal energy could penetrate the bronze; it was as if they vanished into thin air.</p><p>Aside from its extraordinary weight, the bronze showed no other remarkable qualities.</p>
