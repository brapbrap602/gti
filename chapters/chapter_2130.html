<h1>Chapter 2120: Mutual Probing</h1><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, inseparable and masters of combo techniques, intended to surprise the enemy.  However, they were forced to call for help before they had a chance, a development they hadn't anticipated.</p><p>The enemy's background is unknown.  Breaking the array wouldn't be possible relying only on top experts like them; they needed Lu Wang's troops to cooperate.  If necessary, lower-level cultivators would need to scout ahead, otherwise, they would have to do the scouting themselves.</p><p>The swift annihilation of the entire Jiu Gui unit was unacceptable and would severely demoralize the troops.</p><p>The current conflict wasn't about a temporary setback. Even if it meant losing face, Shi Mu had to swallow the bitter pill.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Gan felt a strange premonition and was secretly surprised.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying were quite famous within the Si You tribe. Although both were only at the early stage of the Kong Realm  level two, their combined strength was enough to make even him cautious.</p><p>How long had they been in there?</p><p>Using the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram, Lu Gan could pinpoint Shi Mu's location, but he didn't know what had happened to them, leaving him full of questions.</p><p>However, Lu Gan sensed unusual fluctuations deep within the Thunder Marsh, likely the cause of Shi Mu's sudden call for help.</p><p>Simultaneously with Shi Mu's call, Lu Gan perceived a sharp decrease in the Jiu Gui cultivators' aura, suggesting the situation was more critical than he had imagined.</p><p>Lu Gan didn't hesitate and immediately activated the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram.</p><p>Fortunately, the diagram's power didn't repel him; he controlled it as if it were an extension of his own body, obeying his will.</p><p>Within the Thunder Marsh, Shi Mu, Shi Ying, and the Jiu Gui cultivators were all enveloped in a Xuan Huang  light, as if connected to the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram by invisible threads.</p><p>The next moment, the Xuan Huang light exploded, and countless dazzling light clusters appeared in the Thunder Marsh, rivaling the thunderbolts themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as he suddenly looked towards the edge of the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>At the same time, thunder deities appeared in the sky, each surrounded by lightning, radiating terrifying power. Their weapons pointed downwards as divine retribution descended!</p><p>*Crack!*  *Boom!*</p><p>The lightning was like a torrent, devastating and destructive!</p><p>Many Jiu Gui cultivators were annihilated before they could even scream, vanishing into smoke.  In that instant, countless lives were lost.</p><p>But at the same time, a beam of light pierced the sky, penetrating the Thunder Marsh, and collided with tremendous force.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Like a heavy hammer blow, it shook heaven and earth.</p><p>The thunder deities trembled, their weapons unsteady, causing the lightning to pause momentarily.</p><p>Instantly, the Xuan Huang light on everyone merged with this beam of light, then began to recede. Those who were scattered and struggling were swept into the light and retreated.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying retreated with the others, but they still had to guard against Qin Sang and couldn't relax.</p><p>*Crack!*  *Rumbleâ€¦*</p><p>"Demon, where do you flee?!"</p><p>The sounds of thunder and angry shouts were incessant.</p><p>After a brief chaos, the thunder deities attacked again, unleashing even more ferocious lightning strikes to continue their slaughter.  Unfortunately, the enemy retreated too quickly, and not all of them could be captured.</p><p>After repelling two beast companions, Qin Sang's main body also gave up the chase, watching Shi Mu and the others escape from the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, leading the remnants of the Jiu Gui unit, fled back to the Wu Ding Ba Ji Diagram, in a state of utter disarray. A rough count revealed that the Jiu Gui unit had suffered nearly half casualties in a short time.</p><p>Shi Mu's face was livid.  A single misstep had led to complete failure. This defeat was entirely due to his wrong strategy; the enemy had seized the opportunity and dealt a heavy blow.</p><p>Lu Wang and others emerged from their palanquin.</p><p>Seeing the disastrous state of the Jiu Gui unit, Lu Wang felt pain, but his expression remained calm.  With a concerned look, he asked, "Were the two Daoists unharmed?"</p><p>Shi Mu showed shame, bowed, and sighed, "I underestimated the opponent, leading to heavy losses for the Jiu Gui unit. I failed to live up to expectations!"</p><p>"Go and treat your wounds quickly!"</p><p>Lu Wang sternly dismissed the Jiu Gui unit and spoke kindly to Shi Mu and Shi Ying. "Victory and defeat are common in warfare. You two are our mainstays; it's fortunate that you were not injured. What discoveries did you make?"</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Shi Mu recounted the events in the Thunder Marsh in detail.</p><p>"Oh?  That Qin Zhenren personally made his move in the first attack?"</p><p>Everyone was indeed most concerned about this point, but only the first attack didn't reveal much.</p><p>Then, everyone discussed Shi Mu's encounter.</p><p>"The true nature of those thunder deities is unclear.  It sounds like a thunder array.  It seems the first challenge is to break the array."</p><p>"Good. Next, we should ask a fellow cultivator skilled in this to take action."</p><p>"Fellow cultivators who attempt the formation next must be careful.  The thunder spirits' displays may not be their true strength. Their attacks were interrupted by the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, possibly releasing the trapped cultivators.  They could be deceiving us, waiting for a later, more decisive attack!"</p><p>At this time, the Grand Protector spoke: "Fellow cultivators, do you remember the locations where the thunder spirits appeared and the patterns of their lightning strikes? Describe them, and let us together ponder this, perhaps we can find the formation's pattern."</p><p>"I do!"</p><p>Shi Mu nodded, activating his true energy, and recreated his previous experiences for everyone to see.</p><p>In the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Shi Mu and the others retreat to the land, his gaze passing over them to the depths of the mainland.  He saw mountains like dark eyebrows and forests of flags.</p><p>The other side was testing him, and he, in turn, was testing them, using this method to probe their details.</p><p>Only a beam of Xuanhuang light was forced out, leaving Qin Sang somewhat disappointed. The opponent used the Xuanhuang light to forcefully break through the formation and take people away, but showed no other changes.</p><p>That landmass certainly wouldn't be so simple. Qin Sang was not in a hurry, ordering the thunder spirits to hide in the Thunder Marsh, continuing to wait for the second wave of attackers.</p><p>The other party was more patient than Qin Sang expected.  Several days passed before cultivators left the land and flew towards the Thunder Marsh.  This time, the number was similar to before, except that besides Shi Mu and Shi Ying, there was another expert with comparable cultivation.</p><p>And they changed tactics, no longer rashly advancing. The cultivators gathered in a group, with the three experts positioned at three different points, cautiously moving forward.</p><p>Shortly after, Shi Mu and the others returned to their previous escape point and were immediately attacked.</p><p>Thunder spirits filled the sky, thunder roared and lightning flashed, striking madly at the group.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from the shadows, seeing the enemy completely abandoning their attack, allowing themselves to be struck by lightning, forming a tight formation, their protective dome overhead like a turtle shell.</p><p>After waiting for a while without seeing an opportunity, Qin Sang decided to personally intervene.</p><p>Shi Mu and the other two remained vigilant; Qin Sang's intervention was instantly detected.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>The three had already agreed on a strategy. Shi Mu and Shi Ying immediately broke through the formation, leaving the last one to maintain the battle array.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang, Shi Mu, and Shi Ying clashed.</p><p>At the same time, the other expert began to shift their formation, attempting to counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the other battlefield and said lightly, "Do you two think you can stop me?"</p><p>"We only wish to test the might of Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Shi Mu said in a deep voice.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his tone, advising: "If you want to spar, I'm always ready. You are not slaves of the Lu family, why get involved in this mess?  Dying here would be a pity."</p><p>Shi Mu shook his head. "We are not for the Lu family, but we are moved by the Grand Protector, and willingly serve.  The Lu King has the Tutor and the Grand Protector by his side, with many experts. Compared to us, you are the weaker side, Daoist Qin."</p><p>He looked behind Qin Sang. "Aren't you also an outsider, Daoist Qin?  Why interfere in the Si You Clan's affairs? Your clan was originally innocent, but because of your actions, they now face life and death. As long as you hand over the Si family remnants, the Lu King will not make things difficult for you, and will even persuade the Min Zhuo clan leader to negotiate peace.  Why not?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. "You are not a subordinate of the Lu King, how would you know the Lu King's thoughts?  And am I a man who breaks his word? Since you are so stubborn, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>As both sides exchanged words, their attacks did not diminish, but intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang, wearing Ming Shan armor and wielding a spirit tablet, used the Great Vajra Wheel Seal to fight two opponents without falling behind.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged a glance.  Their six companion beasts simultaneously vanished, their roars echoing.</p><p>At the same time, each took out an itemâ€”what seemed like a jade bracelet cut in half, each taking a piece.</p><p>They threw these treasures, which merged with a 'snap' in mid-air, then disappeared instantly, along with the beasts, leaving no trace.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to use its Sky-Eye ability. But in the butterfly's vision, a faint white light enveloped the six beasts, their forms fading until they completely vanished.</p><p>This strange sight made Qin Sang realize that the six beasts had not become invisible, but had used a secret technique, and with the help of the treasure, transformed into a special state undetectable to others.</p><p>Qin Sang did not act rashly, his heart filled with more caution.  The next moment, he felt a gust of wind from his left, and a companion beast's claw appeared.</p><p>The claw had four sharp points, each as sharp as a sword, appearing silently and suddenly.  Behind the claw was a void, the beast seemed to be leaping out from it.  Before it even appeared, its shocking aura pressed down.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp attack almost upon him.  With a thought, he hurled his spirit tablet. The tablet's force was immense, momentarily halting the claws of the beast.</p><p>But this was only the beginning. As Qin Sang moved, voids appeared in the air, nearly encircling him, unleashing fierce attacks.  Demons and spirits danced around him, ice and fire clashed â€“ chaos reigned, yet their attacks were perfectly coordinated, all focused on Qin Sang.</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel empowered Qin Sang with unparalleled combat instincts.  He wasn't afraid of the siege, but these were all Void Realm level two experts.  He didn't want to lose the initiative, so he spread his phoenix wings.  A streak of green lightning, moving with uncanny speed and trajectory, weaved through his attackers, escaping their encirclement with effortless grace.</p><p>Breaking free, Qin Sang charged towards the two masters, Shi Mu and Shi Ying.  They remained calm, seemingly motionless.  Yet, voids appeared before Qin Sang, and six spirit beasts formed a wall, barring his path.  Behind him, the voids had vanished, the beasts seemingly capable of teleporting.</p><p>With enraged roars, the beasts lunged.  Qin Sang had to abandon his attack, his lightning-fast movements dodging their assault.  Unexpectedly, the six beasts vanished again, reappearing beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously used his escape techniques, changing direction constantly, but couldn't shake the beasts.  Like phantoms, they always appeared where he was most vulnerable, their attacks relentless.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying watched from a distance. It wasn't that they didn't want to intervene directly; controlling the beasts and their artifacts demanded their full concentration.  Secretly, they rejoiced.  Qin Sang was desperately trying to escape, unaware that the real danger was closing in.</p><p>With each appearance of the beasts, the power of their artifacts increased, steadily locking down the battlefield.  Even the most skilled escape techniques would be useless!</p><p>However, Qin Sang had anticipated this.  Furthermore, while dodging the beasts, his Tianmu butterfly companion had noticed something.</p><p>An invisible force permeated the area, like a dark cloud enveloping the battlefield. Each time the beasts disappeared, they seemingly merged with this cloud, rendering them invisible even to the butterfly.</p><p>But now that the butterfly had detected the cloud, the beasts could no longer hide.  Qin Sang immediately devised a plan.</p><p>Feigning helplessness, he subtly increased the range of his movements, appearing in different corners of the battlefield, constantly shifting his position.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, despite their advantage, remained vigilant. They knew Qin Sang still held back his strongest techniques.  To their surprise, he continued flitting about, seemingly without a strategy.</p><p>After a while, Shi Mu's brow furrowed, a sense of foreboding washing over him.  His gaze traced Qin Sang's flight path, and a sudden realization dawned.</p><p>Simultaneously, Shi Ying gasped, "No!"</p><p>Qin Sang's flight path resembled a chaotic net. Each clash with the beasts left residual energy. His speed was so great that the energy hadn't dissipated, now covering the entire battlefield.  Individually insignificant, the combined energies formed a pattern, strategically located at key points â€“ the very points where Shi Mu and Shi Ying were hidden.  Their secret was exposed.</p><p>With a flash, Qin Sang reappeared, his spirit tablet hanging loosely.  A smile played on his lips as he looked at the shocked Shi Mu and Shi Ying.  He struck the tablet with force.</p><p>A tremendous explosion ripped through the air, a wave of power sweeping across the battlefield.</p><p>With a resounding thud, a white light appeared as one of their artifacts was violently expelled.  They quickly recovered it. The six beasts twisted into view, their invisibility broken.</p><p>To add insult to injury, thunder roared from another part of the battlefield, accompanied by faint cries of pain.  They glanced over in alarm to see the thunder gods dramatically transformed, showcasing even greater power than before.</p><p>This is to make up for yesterday's delay; today's update will be late.</p><p>Also, Dong Ge is awesome!</p>
