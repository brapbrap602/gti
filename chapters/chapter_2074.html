<h1>Chapter 2065: Zhu Yan</h1><p>The mirage vanished, and the scene ahead returned to a misty haze.  The debate ended.</p><p>The fleeting sensation of a celestial palace, so close and ethereal, a single step away from liberation, left a profound impression on everyone, a feeling difficult to erase.  No wonder so many members of different tribes are so drawn to mirages.</p><p>Everyone secretly hoped to encounter another mirage, but to no avail.</p><p>After traveling through the mists for over a month, a hazy scene appeared ahead.  Everyone rejoiced, surging forward to break through the mist, only to find the landscape still bleak.</p><p>But it wasn’t mist, it was snow.</p><p>A biting wind whipped through the air, large snowflakes falling steadily, a vast expanse of white stretching from the sky to the sea. The ocean had become a snowfield.  Judging by the time of day, it should be daytime, but under the heavy snow clouds, the light was unusually dim.</p><p>“Legend says Hanhuang was not originally here, but specifically relocated to this harsh land…”</p><p>Ji Hong held out a small hand, catching a snowflake. The fluffy white flake could serve as his blanket.</p><p>Among the group, he possessed the broadest knowledge of the various tribes. “The climate is the reason. This sea area is almost in perpetual night, and Hanhuang’s territory is perpetually covered in snow. But what others see as a wasteland, Hanhuang and their associated clans thrive in…”</p><p>They arbitrarily chose a direction and flew for a long time across the boundless sea, finally spotting a landmass. They made contact with one of Hanhuang's associated clans, receiving directions, and eventually reached Hanhuang territory.</p><p>It wasn't so much land as an ice sheet.  Thick ice covered what might be earth and stone below, but it was invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>Hanhuang has only three seasons: the Mist Year, the Snow Year, and the Wind Year.  The heavy snow had just stopped, and the cold wind intensified daily.  In the eyes of the Hanhuang people, the Snow Year is the best time of year.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others soon encountered the people of Hanhuang. Unexpectedly, their build and facial features were indistinguishable from humans. The most significant differences were their blue hair and blue eyes, and skin so pale it was almost transparent, their bodies seeming composed of ice and water.</p><p>Their adaptability to the cold was extraordinary. Even with the snow flying and the north wind howling, ordinary clothing made of ice silk was sufficient.</p><p>They lived in ice houses, used sleds for transportation, cultivated crops that grew in the snow and ice, and built their cities from ice, revering the snow and ice while living peacefully.</p><p>The supernatural powers of Hanhuang cultivators were also related to ice and snow.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli.  If she came to Hanhuang, she would easily adapt, and perhaps even gain insights into their powers.</p><p>Walking through the ice city, Su Nu, observing the Hanhuang people coming and going, suggested, "How about we try changing our hair and eyes to blue, to disguise ourselves as Hanhuang people?"</p><p>Si Lu considered carefully. "It's worth a try, but Hanhuang's powers are harder to fake. Unless we fight someone, minor flaws should be inconsequential.”</p><p>Disguising themselves as Hanhuang people would be much easier than remaining as humans.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to say,  "Once we reach the Hanhuang capital, Su Nu, Gu Ya, and the others should stay and find a place to settle. Si Lu, Ji Hong, and I will scout ahead to the Zhu Yan tribe."</p><p>Gu Ya gasped, urgently asking, "Can't we go with you, seniors?"</p><p>Her heart was already back in the Storm Realm. She thought she would quickly return to her sect, but being left behind was unacceptable.</p><p>"So many outsiders would attract the Zhu Yan's attention, hindering our actions later.  If anything unexpected happens, the three of us can escape more easily. Once we find the Storm Realm, I will find a way to get you there…"</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>The Jiaojiao tribe held a special position in the Celestial Department, and with Ji Hong accompanying them, it would ease many difficulties. Qin Sang decided to use the Hanhuang teleportation array to directly travel to the Zhu Yan tribe.</p><p>But adding Su Nu, three Transcendence Realm experts entering their territory—the Zhu Yan tribe wouldn't ignore this. After all, the Saint Race's powerful individuals were all in the Holy Land, and the strongest in each tribe were only at the Void Realm, Second Stage.</p><p>"Don't worry! I'll think of a good solution, we'll all become Hanhuang people, and maybe Qin Xiong won't even need to pick us up," Su Nu consoled.</p><p>Having agreed, they set off for the Hanhuang capital. Once Su Nu and the others were settled, and Ji Hong had thoroughly investigated Hanhuang customs, they bid farewell and headed towards the palace where the teleportation array was located.</p><p>Officially, a Void Realm, First Stage cultivator was stationed there.  Seeing Qin Sang and the two others, he was slightly surprised.</p><p>Ji Hong sat on Si Lu's shoulder, while Qin Sang and Si Lu concealed their faces with cloaks.</p><p>"I wonder when you all arrived. Why is there no record of your arrival in the palace?"</p><p>Ji Hong was in charge of negotiations. He seemed innocent, but he could lie without blinking an eye.  "We were caught in a strange fog and accidentally stumbled upon your territory. We wish to use your dimensional array to leave. Our people have a pact with yours, so I hope you'll be so kind as to grant us passage."</p><p>The guard hesitated. He knew about the pact between their peoples:  anytime the Jiaojiao people found superior crops in a certain area, they had to first introduce them in that place, sharing the seeds with the land's owners.</p><p>The Jiaojiao clan, due to their unique abilities, held a superior position. All tribes were reluctant to offend them, so their arrival was generally welcomed because of this pact.</p><p>The Hanhuang Kingdom wasn't short of skilled individuals with similar abilities, but they were a step behind the Jiaojiao.</p><p>"Have you found any superior crops?" the guard asked.</p><p>"We're eager to return. Our stay has been short, and we haven't found any. If your kingdom needs anything, I can return to help you look," Ji Hong said, thumping his chest.</p><p>The Hanhuang Kingdom was a powerful, established nation, so they weren't urgently in need of superior crops. However, befriending a Jiaojiao expert was not a bad thing.</p><p>The guard glanced outside. He was leaning toward letting them go; checks on those leaving were less strict than those entering, and there were no abnormalities in the country.</p><p>He was considering whether to ask the elder stationed there for instructions when he heard a transmitted message: "Let them go."</p><p>The guard's eyes flashed. He waved his hand, opening the palace doors and gestured them to proceed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu sensed a subtle shift.  Their eyes, peering from beneath their cloaks, gazed into the depths of the palace.</p><p>Si Lu transmitted a message: "Someone may have noticed something."</p><p>"Perhaps they suspect something, but they certainly can't confirm your identities. It seems they don't want to investigate further.  As we predicted, unless the Hanhuang Kingdom is plotting against Siyou, they wouldn't forcibly detain you; you'd be too much trouble. You're a hot potato," said Qin Sang.</p><p>Si Lu nodded slightly.</p><p>Because of the sacred land's location, various tribes maintained a fragile peace.  Genocide within the different human tribes was practically unheard of. The Hanhuang Kingdom, accustomed to its icy lands, didn't want to go out, and others didn't want to come in.</p><p>Interfering in the affairs of another tribe, especially another powerful one, could easily provoke unexpected trouble.</p><p>A flash of light, the familiar sensation of spinning, and they found themselves on another dimensional array.</p><p>The three opened their eyes. Below them was a high altar, surrounded by several vermilion stone pillars, but without a roof, encircled by towering peaks.  Several people stood opposite the altar.</p><p>Then, they heard a strange laugh.  "Haha! Little thing, you dare return!"</p><p>One of them pointed at Ji Hong, who was on Si Lu's shoulder, and burst into laughter. The laughter echoed through the mountains, jarringly loud.</p><p>This person had a pointed face and small eyes but lacked any sleazy air; instead, he had a rather valiant bearing. His hair was a mess, unkempt. He wore a crimson battle robe, and his exposed hands were also reddish. He held a bright gold long staff.</p><p>His laughter was so unrestrained that he almost fell over if not for the staff supporting him. The others around him also looked amused.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Ji Hong's mood instantly soured.  His cheeks puffed up in anger.</p><p>The last time he had come to the Zhuyan tribe, this man was on guard.  He hadn't expected to see him again so soon.</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>The man finally stopped laughing. He looked at Ji Hong with a playful glint in his eyes. "Little thing, did you bring reinforcements this time? It doesn't matter; no matter how many helpers you bring, grandpa will take you on! As long as you can win one fight, grandpa will make a pact with you, and you can go anywhere except the tribe's forbidden grounds, without any questions asked!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu had heard Ji Hong talk about his last encounter.</p><p>The Zhuyan tribe was inherently warlike.  Once their tempers flared, they wouldn't even spare a god-king. Ancient pacts were as good as nothing to them.</p><p>This Zhuyan tribesman, upon seeing a Jiaojiao for the first time, felt a thrill of the hunt and insisted on fighting Ji Hong. If Ji Hong won, he would be allowed to search for superior crops within the Zhuyan tribe.</p><p>The Jiaojiao clan traveled widely, relying on their escape abilities. Fighting wasn't their strength. In a head-to-head battle, they were no match for the Zhuyan.</p><p>After a fierce battle, Ji Hong, covered in dust and grime, was forced to use his escape abilities to flee the battlefield.</p><p>He tried to reason with the Zhuyan elder, but the elder avoided him. Other Zhuyan experts then repeatedly challenged him under the same conditions.</p><p>Ji Hong had nowhere to hide.  He had almost exhausted his escape abilities.  If the fights continued, he might get beaten to a pulp.  He fled the Zhuyan tribe, still seething with anger about the whole incident.</p><p>"Wild monkey!  Just how long do you think you can act arrogant? Today, I'm coming for payback!" Ji Hong yelled, arms akimbo, full of bluster.</p><p>Zhu Yan was slightly surprised and sized up Qin Sang and Si Lu, unable to discern anything remarkable.  He let out a cruel laugh, twirled his staff, and was about to utter some harsh words.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light flashed across the sky, abruptly changing course overhead, followed by a strong, somewhat aged voice.</p><p>“You scoundrel! Retreat at once! How dare you be so rude to our honored guests!”</p><p>The light vanished, revealing a white-haired elder, his face etched with wrinkles, yet his figure was erect, his eyes bright and compelling.  He stood there, majestic and imposing, like a towering mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu were secretly awed.</p><p>The elder bowed slightly to Ji Hong, “Our oversight in the past is to blame; please forgive us, young friend.”</p><p>Then his gaze shifted to Qin Sang and Si Lu, briefly observing them before his eyes suddenly flashed with intense light.  “Would you two esteemed cultivators care for a match?”</p><p>Ji Hong’s face fell, and he sighed, “Like father, like son!”</p><p>The Zhu Yan expert who had just been rebuked muttered under his breath, indignant.</p><p>Si Lu stepped forward, bowing, “My name is Qu Lin.  I don't yet know your venerable name.”</p><p>The elder seemed to remember that they were guests. “My apologies! My apologies! I am Yuan Miao.  It is a pleasure to meet you, Cultivator Qu.”</p><p>Si Lu nodded, his tone softening. “Cultivator Ji Hong is a close friend.  We are here to help him collect superior seeds and have no intention of causing conflict with your tribe. You are aware of the Jiao Jiao clan's abilities; allowing them to search for seeds in your territory benefits both sides. I hope Cultivator Yuan will grant us permission.”</p><p>“I am aware of the Jiao Jiao clan's capabilities, but our tribes have no prior dealings. The fact that so many powerful cultivators have arrived together makes me wonder if there’s another motive.”</p><p>Yuan Miao shook his head, mumbling.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu frowned at his far-fetched excuse.</p><p>Then Yuan Miao’s eyes lit up. “However, as the saying goes, ‘a fight makes friends.’  If you can defeat me in battle, it will prove your intentions are pure, and you may come and go here freely after that!”</p><p>What kind of logic is that?</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu were stunned, realizing that this old monkey was simply looking for a reason to fight them.</p><p>But judging by Yuan Miao’s expression, refusing him would likely cause trouble.</p><p>“I’ve heard the Zhu Yan are warlike; it’s truly their reputation. But they're also easy to handle. If you defeat him, he'll be completely submissive and unlikely to break his word,” Si Lu transmitted, sighing. “It seems we can't avoid a fight today.  What are your thoughts, Qin?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. Yuan Miao, although also at the early stage of the Void Realm Second Level, possessed a profound aura, far surpassing Si Lu, who had just entered that realm.  The Zhu Yan were naturally combative, often settling disputes through combat.  Their fighting experience was incredibly rich.</p><p>Si Lu wasn’t a match for Yuan Miao; he himself must fight.</p><p>But fighting personally risked exposing his identity.</p><p>Should he simply retreat and find another way?</p><p>“You have the ability to manifest wings, allowing you to disguise yourself as a member of the Yu tribe's royal family. While there's a mix of demonic energy, if I insist you're a guard hired by me, we have a chance of deceiving them.  My Heavenly Department's upper clan has contacts with the East Sea aquatic clans; associating with demonic cultivators is common.  Also, I have a suggestion, would you like to hear it, Qin?” Si Lu said.</p><p>Before this trip, they had discussed, Si Lu knew some of Qin Sang's abilities.</p><p>“Please tell me,” Qin Sang replied immediately.</p><p>“The place you seek is near the Zhu Yan territory.  After finding it, how do you plan to live? Can you truly remain hidden forever?</p><p>“Compared to other tribes, the Zhu Yan, with their nature, are actually easier to get along with.</p><p>“As long as you can subdue them with your strength and ask for a place to live, they might agree.</p><p>“This battle will happen sooner or later! Of course…”</p><p>Si Lu suddenly smiled. “Once they recognize you as a worthy opponent, they might frequently challenge you.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  Along the way, he had been primarily concerned with how to interact with nearby unusual human tribes.</p><p>Si Lu's words held some truth; encountering the Zhu Yan might be the best outcome.</p><p>However, to maintain the charade, he should only use his strength abilities this time.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang stepped into the air, his aura rising steadily. “Cultivator Qu Lin's injuries haven't healed.  As his guard, I will take on Cultivator Yuan’s challenge!”</p>
