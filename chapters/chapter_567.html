<h1>Chapter 560: Purple Micro Palace and the Sinful God Palace</h1><p>The ubiquitous spiritual tide possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth.</p><p>The entire world was shrouded in a hazy mist.</p><p>Amidst the spiritual tide, the four-colored cloud clusters appeared minuscule, yet they steadily advanced.</p><p>Having traveled an unknown distance into the ancient Immortal battlefield, a purple rainbow suddenly appeared to the left and front of the four-colored cloud clusters.  It moved with astonishing speed, weaving through the spiritual tide, rapidly approaching the cloud clusters.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the rainbow's core was a warship!</p><p>If Qin Sang could see the ship, she would instantly recognize it as a unique flying artifact of the Skyfaring League, known as the Skyfaring Warship.</p><p>Skyfaring League artifacts seemed to adhere to a unified standard, even their functions were similar, differing only in power.</p><p>However, this Skyfaring Warship was more than ten times larger than the largest warship Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>"Old Bull Nose, you're finally here! I thought you were too cowardly to go to the Purple Micro Palace!"</p><p>The four-colored cloud clusters stopped, waiting for the Skyfaring Warship to approach.  The mocking voice of the Red-haired Ancestor echoed from within.</p><p>Qin Sang, remaining safely within the red cloud, realized that Skyfaring League cultivators had arrived. She widened her eyes to look outside, but could only see a long purple rainbow.</p><p>A cold snort came from the warship, a retort, "Red-haired Old Ghost, I think you’re the one who’s getting more cowardly with age! Don't die in the Purple Micro Palace this time!"</p><p>The Red-haired Ancestor sneered, "I'm waiting to collect your corpse.  I hear you failed your attempt to break through to late Nascent Soul stage.  Don't get any worse injuries or the Sinful Abyss will take advantage of your weakness, leaving you childless!”</p><p>The person on the warship angrily retorted, "If the Skyfaring League falls, your Little Cold Domain won't be able to stay out of it!  Remember our agreement from the other day. If you're not benevolent, don't blame me for being unjust!"</p><p>After a pause, the Red-haired Ancestor stopped shouting, and transmitted his voice in a chilling tone, "What, Old Bull Nose, do you really want to surrender to the Sinful Abyss and become their vassal?"</p><p>This time, it was the person on the warship who was measured, replying calmly, "If things become unavoidable, I can't let the Skyfaring League and all its disciples perish. Being a vassal is better than death! I'll see how long you can remain free in your Little Cold Domain!"</p><p>The Red-haired Ancestor was furious, "You dare threaten me…"</p><p>"Do you think I’m joking?"</p><p>The person on the warship sneered, "Red-haired Old Ghost, come and see just how aggressive the Sinful Abyss has become. If the Sinful God Palace and Purple Micro Palace weren't opening at the same time, those old fellows from the Sinful Abyss wouldn't want to miss the treasure hunt, and I might not even be here."</p><p>The Red-haired Ancestor fell silent.</p><p>Finally, someone intervened.</p><p>A voice, that of the Profound Ghost Sovereign, echoed from the demonic energy, "Alright, both of you, this isn't the time for bickering. The Sinful Abyss is strong, but not to the point that we should fear them. Let’s focus on the Purple Micro Palace. We can discuss this later. True One Daoist, have you gathered all the materials for the Little North Star Yuan Formation?"</p><p>With the Profound Ghost Sovereign mediating, the Red-haired Ancestor and True One Daoist stopped arguing.</p><p>True One Daoist said with some reluctance, "I’ve lost the bet. It took me over ten years to gather these materials.  Just don't mess up your end."</p><p>Before he finished, a booming voice echoed from the seven-colored demonic fog where the Tianyao Qiu cultivators were located, "Don't worry, everyone, I've brought our clan's treasure, there will be no mistakes."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The Profound Ghost Sovereign said calmly, "Everything is ready.  Spatial rifts are everywhere ahead. Even for us, we must proceed cautiously. Please put aside your differences and cooperate."</p><p>By this time, the Skyfaring Warship had flown close to the four-colored cloud cluster and slowed down, approaching gradually.</p><p>Finally, the two merged, proceeding side-by-side.</p><p>Not long after, they encountered a spatial rift.</p><p>This rift shone with a milky-white light. It appeared extremely thin, floating in the void, remaining unmoved even when struck by the spiritual tide.</p><p>It was the spiritual tide that suffered.  No matter how large, any spiritual tide that touched the rift would be easily cut in half.  It was unclear whether the spiritual tide wasn’t powerful enough or if the spatial rift was simply too terrifying.</p><p>Even the Nascent Soul cultivators from the two domains didn't dare provoke the spatial rift and immediately chose to go around it.</p><p>At first, the spatial rifts were few and far between, but they became increasingly dense the deeper they went.  Some were incredibly well-hidden and almost impossible to detect.  The danger here was no less than in the Inner Valley of the Endless Gorge.</p><p>They had to not only withstand the onslaught of the spiritual tide but also dodge the spatial rifts, significantly slowing their progress.</p><p>Silence fell over the red clouds.  Only the rumbling roar of the spiritual tide could be heard.  Their safety rested in the hands of the Nascent Soul cultivators, and Qin Sang could only trust to fate, feeling the ship veer left, then right, sometimes even circling back, with no end in sight.</p><p>The slowing pace was unmistakable. Qin Sang was quietly astonished by the terrifying nature of the core area of the Ancient Immortal battlefield, forcing even these powerful Nascent Soul cultivators to proceed with extreme caution.</p><p>Several times during their journey, they encountered sudden dangers, forcing them to make emergency turns, causing considerable worry among everyone.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.  The Tianxing Warship and the four-colored cloud formation, though appearing erratic, moved steadily forward without major incident.</p><p>After a long half-day's flight, Qin Sang suddenly felt the red clouds stop. Just as he was wondering if they had encountered some unforeseen problem, he heard several soft exclamations around him: "Ziwei Palace!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He abruptly stood up, his eyes widening as he gazed forward.  The sight that met his eyes made him gasp, stunned by the unprecedented scale of the celestial phenomenon!</p><p>Before them lay a desolate desert, its surface scarred with deep craters, clear evidence of the spiritual tide's impact.  Even sand dunes, if any existed originally, must have been flattened, offering an unobstructed view to the horizon.</p><p>This vast area was remarkably free of spatial rifts.  Deep within the desert, high in the sky, the ubiquitous spiritual tide was absent. In its place was a white, cyclone-like vortex, stretching to the horizon.</p><p>No, it wasn't that the spiritual tide was absent.  The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was being drawn into the vortex and could not escape!</p><p>Within the vortex, it appeared remarkably calm.  The white clouds seemed motionless, a stark contrast to the wild fury of the spiritual tide.  The cyclone was immense and hung low, even at this distance causing Qin Sang to feel an intense sense of oppression, a profound feeling of his own insignificance.</p><p>Qin Sang was not alone. The others' expressions mirrored his own gravity, their gazes fixed on the spectacle.</p><p>Ziwei Palace lay at the center of the vortex.</p>
