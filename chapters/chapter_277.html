<h1>Chapter 270: Aversion to the Azure Lotus of Fire</h1><p>“Divine objects
    like these, when they appear, surely end up in the hands of Nascent Soul ancestors, right?” Qin Sang remarked.</p>
<p>Wherever the Ten Divine Trees appear, danger is sure to lurk. Those with weaker cultivation simply can’t reach
    them.</p><p>Even if one were to luckily obtain such a treasure with insufficient strength, possessing it would be
    more trouble than it’s worth, possibly inviting fatal disaster.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer shook
    his head. “Of the three instances I know of, one involved a type of spiritual bamboo, one of the Ten Divine Trees
    known as the Pure Fortune Bamboo. Nascent Soul cultivators and transformed demons competed for it, but legend says
    it escaped on its own and remains undiscovered to this day. No one has ever heard of any magical tools crafted from
    Pure Fortune Bamboo.”</p><p>“It escaped while surrounded by Nascent Soul cultivators and transformed demons?” Qin
    Sang was astonished. “Could the Pure Fortune Bamboo have developed sentience and become a transformed demon
    itself?”</p><p>“Hard to say. It might have been hidden by someone. Transformation is extremely difficult for demons,
    especially for beings of the Ten Divine Trees’ caliber. Even developing sentience invites heavenly jealousy, so the
    tribulation of transformation must be incredibly arduous. After all, the path of immortality is never easy…”</p><p>
    Cloud Wanderer seemed to be recalling his own cultivation journey, sighing deeply. Qin Sang, reflecting on his own
    experiences, felt a pang of empathy.</p><p>“What about the second instance?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>“The second
    involved the Unending Blood Mulberry, another of the Ten Divine Trees, known as the ultimate tree of defilement.
    Magical tools crafted from it can unleash a divine ability called the Blood Defilement Light, which can contaminate
    other people’s magical instruments and tools. Inferior instruments might be completely destroyed, while even magical
    tools will suffer a significant loss of spirit and require extensive nurturing to recover.</p><p>It's said that the
    Unending Blood Mulberry was shattered during a struggle between several Nascent Soul demon cultivators, scattering
    its fragments deep within the Boundless Valley. Cultivators still venture into the valley, hoping to find a piece.
    After all, a divine ability like the Blood Defilement Light can instantly decide a battle.</p><p>However, the
    Boundless Valley isn’t easy to navigate. As they say, men die for wealth, birds die for food. Many lose their lives
    in the search.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer spoke with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>“Boundless Valley?”</p><p>Qin Sang
    carefully searched his memory but couldn’t recall hearing the name. It didn’t seem to be among the famous secret
    realms of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer smiled. “The Boundless Valley isn't in the Ancient
    Immortal Battlefield, but rather a forbidden zone deep within the Severed Sky Mountains. Mostly demon cultivators
    enter, and countless have died there. To say corpses litter the ground wouldn’t be an exaggeration.”</p><p>Qin Sang
    nodded silently. So it was in the Severed Sky Mountains.</p><p>The Severed Sky Mountains were vast and boundless,
    containing many forbidden zones and perilous locations within their wilderness.</p><p>“The third instance is even
    more interesting.</p><p>It remains unclear which of the Ten Divine Trees appeared, but shortly after the event, the
    Pure Yang Sect suddenly launched a massive attack on the Blood Nether Sect, single-handedly annihilating the
    then-powerful demon sect and slaying its leader on the spot. It shocked the entire Little Cold Realm!</p><p>Later,
    rumors spread that a low-level disciple of the Blood Nether Sect had obtained the Divine Tree.</p><p>Whether the two
    events are connected remains a mystery, with various speculations circulating.</p><p>However, information seemingly
    released by the Pure Yang Sect later claimed that the Blood Nether Sect disciple had already fled the Little Cold
    Realm with the Divine Tree.</p><p>The truth of the matter is known only to the Pure Yang Sect.”</p><p>Cloud
    Wanderer's tone was tinged with amusement.</p><p>So that was the reason for the Pure Yang Sect’s destruction of the
    Blood Nether Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to himself. The Pure Yang Sect was undoubtedly the strongest of the Eight
    Righteous Sects, and their sect leader's cultivation was unmatched in the Little Cold Realm. Likely no one would
    dare question them directly.</p><p>“Senior, I’ve recovered enough. Let me take the helm.”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and
    offered to relieve Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer, also greatly depleted, readily agreed. He explained the
    method of controlling the Spiritual Bamboo Flying Boat to Qin Sang, who, with his assistance, could still navigate
    the vessel.</p><p>The boat sped through the earth, and even the magnificent and grand spectacle of flowing magma had
    become tiresome.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly glanced at Cloud Wanderer and sighed inwardly, “I hope the trial space
    isn't too far from the stone tablet and that nothing else goes wrong.”</p><p>The two took turns at the helm,
    steadily guiding the Spiritual Bamboo Flying Boat, keeping the Fire Spirit Beasts at bay, and managing to avoid any
    major dangers.</p><p>Qin Sang once again felt his spiritual power depleting and handed control back to Cloud
    Wanderer. Cloud Wanderer gave Qin Sang a puzzled look, as if about to say something, but hesitated.</p><p>“Brother
    Qin… Forgive my bluntness, but is there some hidden damage to your Dantian Qi Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled,
    then understanding dawned. Although he had always been careful to conceal the damage to his foundation, the
    relentless pursuit by the Fire Spirit Beast and the exertion required to control the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat had
    made complete concealment impossible.</p><p>It was natural for Yun Youzi, skilled in both alchemy and medicine, to
    notice some clues.</p><p>With the Ebony Sword and the Ten Yama Banners at his disposal, Qin Sang was completely
    unafraid of cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Moreover, Yun Youzi could only sense that his Qi Sea was damaged,
    but the extent of the damage and its severity were impossible to discern with the naked eye.</p><p>Because of this,
    Qin Sang wasn't afraid of Yun Youzi seeing through him.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had indeed intended to consult
    someone skilled in both alchemy and medicine about restoring his foundation, and Yun Youzi had been on his list of
    potential candidates.</p><p>Since he'd been found out, Qin Sang frankly admitted, “Senior has a keen eye. In order
    to break through to Foundation Establishment, this junior used a secret technique, which caused some damage to my Qi
    Sea. Although it hasn't greatly affected my cultivation, I've tried many methods but haven't been able to heal it.
    It's like a thorn that I can't remove, truly frustrating.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi suddenly
    laughed, much to Qin Sang’s surprise.</p><p>“Brother Qin, we truly are fated. Did you know that the hidden ailment I
    suffered in breaking through to Foundation Establishment affects my Nascent Soul? And like yours, it has become a
    chronic illness. I've traveled far and wide seeking spiritual herbs to restore my Nascent Soul, but unfortunately, I
    haven't seen any improvement. The spiritual herb I encountered underground just now was the Fire-Averse Azure Lotus.
    I thought… but the lotus seeds were already gone…”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s smile faded, his brow furrowed deeply, wrinkles
    etched on his face. His eyes held a deep weariness and disappointment as he sighed heavily.</p><p>“If I can’t cure
    this chronic illness, not only will reaching Golden Core be impossible in this lifetime, but even breaking through
    to mid-Foundation Establishment is uncertain…”</p><p>The Fire-Averse Azure Lotus is a rare spiritual herb. The lotus
    produces twelve lotus seeds, which eventually fuse into one, maximizing its medicinal potency.</p><p>The lotus seeds
    have the effect of nourishing the soul and strengthening the Nascent Soul, making them a truly rare treasure.</p><p>
    To stumble upon a Fire-Averse Azure Lotus only to find it missing its most crucial component…</p><p>It’s a testament
    to Yun Youzi’s resilience that he could face such a swing from elation to despair with such composure, only
    revealing his disappointment when speaking of it.</p>
