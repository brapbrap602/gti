<h1>Chapter 1344: Not a Match for a Single Strike</h1><p>The ebony sword reaped a swarm of spectral souls, swirling back in a flash. Under the cover of the sword's radiance, something silently fell into Qin Sang's palm. Simultaneously, a whisper-like voice reached his ears. Qin Sang's movements paused for a moment. The others noticed the anomaly.</p><p>Elder Canghong asked with concern, "Fellow Daoist Qin, what's wrong?"</p><p>"The Blood Infant's counterattack is growing fiercer," Qin Sang shook his head, masking his true thoughts. His eyes narrowed as he gazed into the depths of the ghostly mist. The surrounding space was once again filled with endless spectral souls and malevolent spirits. The voice he had heard was undoubtedly Bai's, but he couldn't determine its direction. Bai's actions were extremely cautious, as if he was guarding against something.</p><p>Elder Canghong, unsuspecting, nodded with a worried expression. "After that deafening roar, the blood clouds and spectral souls have multiplied. The Demon Lord Ye has clearly noticed us. His intent is obvious—to stop us from approaching the altar at all costs. That earlier roar was earth-shattering. The anomalies within the inner hall must have escalated to an extreme level. Without a doubt, Demon Lord Ye's scheme is about to be revealed..."</p><p>Qin Sang listened silently to Elder Canghong's words, neither agreeing nor disagreeing. A flicker of something strange passed deep within his eyes. He clenched his hand, feeling a cold, sinister sensation. A thin cord now rested in his palm. Bai had controlled a spectral soul to secretly return the Demon-Binding Rope to him!</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he continued to wield his sword to clear the path, as if nothing had happened. Yet, his focus was now razor-sharp.</p><p>The blood clouds thickened. The howls of ghosts echoed incessantly. Just as Elder Canghong had predicted, they had drawn the majority of the evil formation's power. More and more spectral souls and malevolent spirits were being driven toward them by Demon Lord Ye. The group was completely enveloped by the blood clouds. Their vision was filled with a sea of crimson, the clouds so dense that nothing could be seen through them. Along with the endless horde of spectral souls, they felt as if they had been thrown into a blood-soaked hell, the pressure on them growing heavier by the moment.</p><p>The blood clouds clung to them, moving as if alive, constantly churning.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet shattered a mass of blood clouds, charging forward with ferocious momentum. This scene had repeated countless times, with nothing out of the ordinary. The reason they could move so swiftly was largely due to the Nascent Soul puppet's efforts.</p><p>But at this very moment, Qin Sang, who had been on high alert, felt a sudden surge of danger. Without hesitation, he unleashed the sword technique he had prepared earlier.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The sword's hum shook the heavens! The group was startled, their eyes turning to Qin Sang. They saw the ebony sword's light resembling a dragon, its sword energy cutting through the air. The surrounding spectral souls and malevolent spirits were instantly annihilated in vast numbers.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword light reached its peak brilliance, slashing toward the void in front of Qin Sang! Before anyone could comprehend what was happening, the surroundings underwent a sudden transformation. The thick blood clouds, accompanied by countless spectral souls, pressed down with a deafening roar, crashing into the group!</p><p>Chaos ensued. For a moment, the group struggled to maintain their footing. Their formation was instantly disrupted, swallowed by the blood clouds. They frantically activated their magical treasures to defend themselves.</p><p>In front of Qin Sang, the sword light pierced through the air, descending from above. Beneath the sword light, a figure quietly emerged—it was the Jade Skeleton!</p><p>The Jade Skeleton tilted its neck, the bones creaking with a *crack*. It raised a hand, effortlessly blocking the sword light. The ghostly flames in its eye sockets conveyed a sense of disdain. "Heh, a mere early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, yet you can see through my concealment technique. No wonder that brat Ye is so wary of you."</p><p>"Who are you?" Qin Sang asked coldly, his expression composed. Yet, a chill ran down his spine as he observed the Jade Skeleton's appearance. During the battle at the Blood Lake, it was unclear whether the Jade Skeleton had faked its death or if a demon from the Sin God Palace had possessed its body. The Jade Skeleton's flesh had completely withered, leaving it no different from a skeleton. Yet, it still lived, and its power was terrifying. Even with Bai's warning and his own precautions, Qin Sang had barely managed to unleash his sword in time.</p><p>His nerves were stretched to the limit, the hand gripping the Demon-Binding Rope nearly sweating. As expected, his sword strike had caused no damage to the Jade Skeleton.</p><p>As he asked the question, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. His sword technique shifted, and the ebony sword transformed into a sword formation. The void was instantly shrouded in darkness.</p><p>"Seeking death!" Sensing the fluctuations of the sword formation, the ghostly flames in the Jade Skeleton's eye sockets flared violently. It let out a furious roar, its figure vanishing into thin air.</p><p>In the next moment, countless skeletal claws erupted!</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!...*</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with shock. The Jade Skeleton's technique was unlike anything he had ever seen. Even with the aid of his Heavenly Eye ability, he could barely distinguish between the real and illusory claws. But it was meaningless—he couldn't react fast enough to keep up with the claw shadows, let alone counter them.</p><p>Qin Sang exerted all his strength, continuously altering his sword formation, but to little effect. The sword lights were extinguished one after another.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ebony sword let out a mournful cry, struck by a tremendous force, nearly knocked out of Qin Sang's hand. In an instant, a subtle ripple appeared in the void before Qin Sang. A skeletal claw shot out, exuding a bone-chilling cold that could freeze a person solid, aiming directly for Qin Sang's brow!</p><p>"I'm not even a match for a single strike!" The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Thunder roared. The phoenix wings on his back *whooshed* open. Lightning danced between the feathers, making the wings radiant and breathtaking. Qin Sang transformed into a streak of lightning, retreating at incredible speed.</p><p>*Ssshh!*</p><p>The skeletal claw easily pierced through Qin Sang's head, but no blood splattered—it was merely an afterimage he had left behind. The ghostly claw, relentless and unyielding, pursued Qin Sang without pause, determined to tear him apart. Its speed was even faster than Qin Sang's lightning escape!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain at his brow.</p><p>At that moment, two vortexes formed within the blood clouds. Two figures emerged simultaneously—Elder Canghong and Daoist Zhenyi! They were the first to break free from the blood clouds. Seeing Qin Sang being pursued by the Jade Skeleton, they were shocked by the power the skeleton displayed.</p><p>"Sky-Shattering Finger!" Seeing Qin Sang in danger, Elder Canghong didn't hesitate. His eyelids lowered as he chanted softly, his hands forming a complex seal. Around him, a green light swirled, vibrant and full of life. Within the green light grew a vine, rootless, emerging from the void. It climbed up Elder Canghong's body, reaching his head. Its leaves overlapped, swaying gently. The vine's true form was hidden beneath the leaves, which formed a set of green armor.</p><p>The blood clouds and spectral souls launched a frenzied counterattack, shattering countless leaves. But the green light flickered, and new leaves sprouted immediately, preventing the enemies from getting close. The vine was clearly a protective treasure of extraordinary power.</p><p>Elder Canghong, now secure, focused on casting his secret technique. An ancient, majestic aura emanated from him, awe-inspiring! Behind him, a dazzling white light surged. In an instant, the light dissipated, and a colossal figure stepped out from the void. Its features and form were unmistakably those of Elder Canghong himself. The phantom stood a hundred zhang tall, towering between heaven and earth! </p>
