<h1>Chapter 2226: Foundation Building</h1><p>The clouds gathered, obscuring the last rays of moonlight. Qin Sang entered the attic, poured wine for Tongshen and Lu, and stood silently listening to their conversation.</p><p>His mind was preoccupied with the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* cultivation technique.</p><p>He hadn't expected that entering this illusion would illuminate the path for *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>Due to limited resources, Qin Sang had chosen to focus on the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture*, but that didn't mean he would abandon *Tian Yao Lian Xing*. After all, everything was uncertain beyond the Unity Transformation stage, and the path he would take then was unknown.  He might switch to *Tian Yao Lian Xing* and pursue the path of physical strength.</p><p>Even without considering the enhancement of strength through dual cultivation of body and spirit, as Gui Mu had mentioned, refining one's spirit, energy, and soul would greatly benefit future breakthroughs.  As long as his energy allowed, he would strive to improve himself.</p><p>However, after learning about the ancient demon cultivator's method of spirit possession, Qin Sang harbored a new concern.</p><p>Why had the later generations of demon cultivators almost completely abandoned this path? Were there significant drawbacks or hidden dangers?</p><p>If even the demon race had given it up, continuing to cultivate *Tian Yao Lian Xing* didn't seem wise.</p><p>Later demon cultivators also cultivated Dharma Images at the Illusory Void stage.  He wondered what changes would occur after breaking through to the Unity Transformation stage.</p><p>If this path proved unworkable, he could always switch to the methods of later demon cultivators.  Therefore, he wouldn't abandon *Tian Yao Lian Xing* before breaking through to the Unity Transformation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, leaving him with a sense of vagueness.  He wondered if the illusion could generate Unity Transformation or even Mahayana stage experts, and how they would exist.</p><p>In the cultivation world, those who reach the Unity Transformation stage are considered powerful figures, possessing vast supernatural abilities and capable of touching the Dao. If this illusion could create lifelike Unity Transformation experts, it would be incredibly miraculous, and breaking the illusion would become unimaginably difficult.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang no longer dared treat this place as a mere illusion. It undoubtedly held many secrets waiting to be unearthed. If he truly encountered a star soul-level demon cultivator, he might have a chance to seek their guidance.</p><p>In that case, he should also pick up the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique, disguise himself as an ancient demon cultivator—that would surely be safer, allowing him to gather information through the demon race, aiding his search for Liuli.</p><p>But doing so would divide his energy, slowing down his overall progress.</p><p>While pondering these issues, Qin Sang remained alert, eavesdropping on Tongshen and Lu's conversation.</p><p>Lu noticed that Tongshen didn't shy away from discussing things with his disciple, realizing that Qin Sang was highly valued.  Thus, except for the most critical secrets, which were communicated through voice transmission, everything else was spoken openly.</p><p>"After bidding farewell to that friend, I went to Lingkong Mountain. Without much effort, I gathered quite a bit of information. Almost all the Golden Eagle cultivators responsible for guarding the territory received the same order—to post wanted posters, searching for several individuals…"</p><p>Lu said, sipping his wine.</p><p>Lingkong Mountain wasn't a single mountain, but an entire massive range located northeast of Yuanjing Mountain, the habitat of the entire Golden Eagle clan.</p><p>Lingkong Mountain was vast; the further inward, the stronger the Golden Eagle cultivators.  Besides the elusive star soul-level experts, the Dharma Image stage masters of the Golden Eagle clan supposedly resided deep within Lingkong Mountain.</p><p>Yuanjing Mountain was on the outskirts of Lingkong Mountain, guarded only by a small Spirit Enlightenment stage Golden Eagle prince.</p><p>"Oh? Did those friends cause a ruckus in Lingkong Mountain?"</p><p>Tongshen mused, realizing that if those individuals could escape from Lingkong Mountain unscathed, it was likely beyond their reach.</p><p>He felt he had been somewhat impulsive, spurred on by his disciple.</p><p>"Not at all, Lingkong Mountain has always been peaceful! But the order did originate from deep within Lingkong Mountain."</p><p>Lu's expression grew serious. "These past few days, I invited several Golden Eagle friends to a gathering. One of them, during the feast, revealed something—the source of this order may be the Phoenix clan!"</p><p>"The Phoenix clan?"</p><p>Tongshen put down his wine cup, surprised.</p><p>Lu nodded.  "This friend has a powerful background; his information should be reliable. If those people had offended the Golden Eagle clan, the clan would have dispatched powerful figures to hunt them down. The fact that they're only posting wanted posters, without taking significant action, suggests that the Golden Eagle clan isn't taking it too seriously, possibly assuming they are escapees from the Phoenix clan."</p><p>"Not necessarily!"</p><p>Tongshen's tone was heavy. "Perhaps there's already an undercurrent of conflict beneath the surface, and we remain oblivious! I was reckless, we jumped into the whirlpool without knowing anything, and we might invite disaster upon ourselves!"</p><p>His and Lu's background was only slightly better than that of ordinary cultivators. Their friends also possessed similar strengths and influence, openly opposing the Golden Eagle clan was tantamount to hitting a stone with an egg, let alone the Phoenix clan.</p><p>Mr. Lu was startled.  "Fellow Daoist means someone is trying to lure us out? If we withdraw now, I fear it's too late…"</p><p>It turned out Mr. Lu had met a human cultivator, whose sect was located at the northern foot of Lingkong Mountain.</p><p>The Golden Eagle and Phoenix clans' territories were separated by several smaller tribes, completely subservient to the Phoenix clan.  Therefore, Lingkong Mountain was considered to border the Phoenix clan's territory.</p><p>The human cultivator, at Mr. Lu's request, was to investigate. He'd already returned to his sect, and it was too late to recall him.  Sending a message across Lingkong Mountain was too risky.</p><p>An uneasy atmosphere filled the room. Qin Sang saw things more deeply than the others.</p><p>The Phoenix clan was a powerful race in ancient times, rivaled only by a few, like the Dragon clan. Only the celestial star was above them!</p><p>If a Nascent Soul stage cultivator appeared in the illusion, it was likely that this cultivator had sensed something amiss and was searching for the intruders.</p><p>"Perhaps I'm overthinking," the Transcendent Elder consoled, "Let's wait for news from our Daoist friend before deciding. However, we must warn Brother Kui and the others to be extra cautious."</p><p>Two people weren't enough to rescue those people, so Mr. Lu contacted several friends.</p><p>"Right," Mr. Lu nodded, looking around. "Many Daoist friends visit me.  It's too conspicuous.  Fellow Daoist prefers quiet and discretion. You'll handle the communications from now on."</p><p>The Transcendent Elder agreed. They then held a private discussion. Mr. Lu took his leave.</p><p>Watching Mr. Lu fly away, a worried look flashed in the Transcendent Elder's eyes. He sighed, "My disciple, you now understand the dangers of the cultivation world?"</p><p>Qin Sang blamed himself. "It's all my fault for causing trouble and putting Master in danger!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's understanding and maturity, the Transcendent Elder's mood improved. He smiled, "Don't worry, disciple.  Even if the sky falls, your Master will hold it up! A clever rabbit has three burrows. Your senior brother's descent is to find another location for our sect.  We can't fight them, but we can avoid them.  At worst, I'll settle you both in a safe haven – a paradise created by the descendants of the gods and human powerhouses –  and you won't have to fear these monsters anymore!"</p><p>After Mr. Lu's departure, Yuanjing Mountain returned to its quiet state.  The feared crisis didn't arrive, and Qin Sang lived peacefully within the sect.</p><p>The Transcendent Elder, intending to seek opportunities in the mortal world, had unexpectedly met Qin Sang, interrupting his journey, and decided against descending the mountain again.</p><p>Qin Sang's quarters were next to the Transcendent Elder's, who often emerged to guide Qin Sang.</p><p>After much insistence from Qin Sang, the Transcendent Elder finally relented and taught him the most basic alchemy.</p><p>Initially, the Transcendent Elder worried Qin Sang was trying to use external objects, taking shortcuts.  Instead, he was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>His disciple's talent in alchemy surpassed his cultivation talent. The several alchemic manuals he carefully selected were mostly grasped by Qin Sang after a single explanation, needing only a few clarifying questions from his Master to fully understand them.</p><p>Remember, Qin Sang had only just begun cultivating; even the most basic alchemy was beyond his current level.</p><p>The Transcendent Elder had never seen such a prodigious disciple.  The thought that, as his disciple's cultivation deepened, there would soon be nothing left for him to teach, made him break into a sweat.</p><p>Due to Qin Sang's extraordinary performance, the Transcendent Elder, for the first time, summoned earth fire and created a small furnace for him to practice alchemy, to test his true capabilities.</p><p>Of course, he only let Qin Sang refine the most basic spirit medicines, mostly powders and elixirs, with unlimited access to materials.</p><p>Qin Sang's performance didn't disappoint. He kept some of the refined medicines for the Transcendent Elder, and consumed the rest himself.</p><p>Combined with the Transcendent Elder's carefully prepared foundational medicines, Qin Sang's cultivation rapidly progressed, quickly reaching the third level of Qi Refinement. In the Transcendent Elder's eyes, his cultivation and alchemy progressed simultaneously, complementing each other.</p><p>Of course, this is based on later terminology. Qin Sang was still at the first level of Yuanjing Mountain's foundational cultivation method.</p><p>Like the demon clans, the human cultivation realm classifications in ancient times were different from those in later eras.</p><p>Humans have four cultivation realms: Refining Essence to Transform Qi, Refining Qi to Transform Spirit, Refining Spirit to Return to Void, and Returning to Void to Achieve Dao.  These roughly correspond to the demon race's Bright Mind, Transformation, Dharma Image, and Star Soul realms.</p><p>This reveals the long evolution of the cultivation world.  Later cultivators developed a complete and rational cultivation system, clearly outlining the tasks for each realm and the keys to breakthrough. This system is the culmination of countless predecessors' experiences.</p><p>Ancient times also had a Foundation Establishment stage, included within Refining Essence to Transform Qi.  Successful Foundation Establishment was equivalent to the later Foundation Establishment stage, but before that, cultivators had to rely on self-discovery, lacking the thirteen levels of Qi Refinement.</p><p>In the fire chamber:</p><p>"It's just an ordinary iron ring…"</p><p>Qin Sang, having just ruined a batch of medicine, sat beside the alchemy furnace, playing with the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>His cultivation and spiritual sense were too low to sustain continuous alchemy.  Even controlling the heat required the use of the formation inscribed on the alchemy furnace by Master Tongshen.</p><p>He had disguised the ring, greatly altering its appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang had begun his cultivation, but to him, the Qianjun Ring remained an ordinary iron ring, unable to open the small space within.</p><p>"Is it because my cultivation is insufficient?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>If it required him to reach his previous cultivation level for the ring to return to normal, even as someone starting over, it would be impossible in a short time.</p><p>Sighing, Qin Sang put away the Qianjun Ring, calculated the time, and thought his master should be finishing his seclusion soon.</p><p>He glanced at the herbs on the shelf nearby, preparing to refine the first spirit pill from the "Clear Dew Returning Pill Manual," a 'surprise' for his master.</p><p>Speaking of which, Qin Sang discovered another difference between ancient and modern times.</p><p>Storage items are incredibly precious here!</p><p>Modern disciples receive a storage pouch upon entering their sect. Qin Sang still hasn't received one.</p><p>Master Tongshen said he would get a storage item as a reward upon successful Foundation Establishment, the same as his senior siblings.  However, these pouches have very limited space, only enough for necessities.</p><p>"People long for the ancient times, unaware of its many inconveniences!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, drawing the herbs into the alchemy furnace, activating the formation and the earth fire.</p><p>The firelight illuminated Qin Sang's small face, turning it bright red.</p><p>With a serious expression, he meticulously completed each step. The fire in the chamber grew brighter, almost igniting his clothes. Finally, the alchemy furnace violently shook, the lid clattered open, and a faint blue light emanated from the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, lifted the lid, and saw two blue pills, translucent like water – the Hua Lu Pills.</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief. Refining the Hua Lu Pills with his current cultivation was quite challenging, but he succeeded.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang took a pill and swallowed it.</p><p>Immediately, his cheeks visibly flushed, his body swayed, his eyes glazed over, as if drunk.  Finally, he simply lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep.</p><p>"My disciple…"</p><p>"My disciple?"</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Master Tongshen's call came from outside.</p><p>Receiving no answer, Master Tongshen, sensing something was wrong, burst in, startled by the sight.</p><p>"My disciple!"</p><p>Master Tongshen rushed to Qin Sang's side, his eyes widening.</p><p>He saw the remaining Hua Lu Pill in the alchemy furnace!  Qin Sang's condition clearly indicated the effects of the pill.</p><p>"This… this…"</p><p>Master Tongshen was too shocked to speak.</p><p>He had only used the Hua Lu Pill as an example, explaining points to note in alchemy, without covering the most intricate parts of the formula.</p><p>This disciple had actually succeeded in refining the Hua Lu Pill through self-study!</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang hadn't fully cultivated the "Clear Dew Returning Pill Manual," receiving no benefit from the cultivation technique!</p><p>Suppressing his emotions, Master Tongshen carried Qin Sang to his quiet room and stayed by his bedside.</p><p>"Master," Qin Sang murmured, waking up after the effects wore off, his cultivation having increased significantly.</p><p>"You're incredibly reckless!" Master Tongshen attempted to scold him, but couldn't suppress the smile playing on his lips.</p><p>That night, Master Tongshen finally passed the "Clear Dew Returning Pill Manual" down to Qin Sang.</p><p>External medicine and internal cultivation complemented each other, allowing Qin Sang to smoothly reach his bottleneck and naturally return to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p>
