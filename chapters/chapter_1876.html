<h1>Chapter 1867:  The Step-by-Step Strategy</h1><p>The imperial decree in hand guided them; the Divine Court lay ahead.</p><p>Before them stretched a vast sea of clouds.</p><p>Auspicious clouds, stretching as far as the eye could see. Such a large expanse of auspicious clouds was extremely rare deep within the Heavenly Altar.</p><p>However, these auspicious clouds seemed different from those in the outside world. The rosy glow within them was dim; the cloud sea appeared shrouded in a layer of gray.</p><p>Instead of conveying serenity, the clouds filled the demons with oppression.  They instinctively halted, an inexplicable urge preventing them from entering, as if some danger lurked within.</p><p>“These auspicious clouds are not what they seem; it’s likely some kind of illusion. Everyone, be careful…”</p><p>A demon king transmitted a warning.</p><p>Normally, following ancestral teachings and avoiding trouble should keep them safe in the Divine Court.</p><p>But no one knew how many years the Divine Court had been in the Heavenly Altar. Over the years, colliding and merging with the surrounding magical illusions, it had likely changed beyond recognition, rendering the ancestral teachings unreliable.</p><p>The demons grew wary.</p><p>With the auspicious clouds impassable ahead and powerful enemies approaching from behind, all eyes turned to the White-robed Demon King.</p><p>The White-robed Demon King withdrew his gaze, coldly commanding, “Hold them off! Kill without mercy!”</p><p>With that, he clutched the half-decree in his hand and stepped alone into the auspicious clouds.</p><p>Whether due to some resistance or a premonition, after entering the clouds, he flew only a dozen yards before stopping.</p><p>The other demons, and the Daoist priests swiftly approaching, could vaguely see the White-robed Demon King's movements.</p><p>His robes billowed, his figure unwavering as the cloud mist flowed around him.</p><p>His white robes were a spiritual treasure-grade garment, its spiritual light flickering as it continuously endured violent shocks, revealing that the clouds were not as gentle as they appeared.</p><p>The White-robed Demon King stared ahead, a flash of brilliance in his eyes. He sat cross-legged, his back to the others, his palms pressed together in front of his chest. The half-decree’s light illuminated his face.</p><p>The demons watched anxiously, yet hopefully, but then a silence descended.</p><p>The White-robed Demon King sat motionless, and neither the decree nor the auspicious clouds showed any change.</p><p>Exchanging glances, the demons remembered the White-robed Demon King's order and understood that no one must disturb him. Focusing their attention, they glared at the approaching black遁光 (escape light), roaring in unison.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Daoist side arrived, their formation tight and orderly. The spiritual talismans on their bodies shone brightly.</p><p>They had seen the White-robed Demon King's actions from afar and had begun building their momentum, their speed increasing as they approached the demons.  The遁光 (escape light) was like a long rainbow, crashing down with terrifying force.</p><p>The demons' breath hitched, their minds assaulted. Their shame and anger fueled a greater roar, their fighting spirit soaring!</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The deafening roars were swallowed by an even greater sound.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The torrent that had brought the demons here reappeared, an endless surge of water forming a thousand-foot-high wall. The terrifying sound promised destruction, leaving no escape for anything in its path.</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura erupted behind the demons, and a gigantic black shadow appeared beneath them—a black-armored demonic turtle, undoubtedly a demon king’s manifestation.</p><p>The black turtle’s form was enormous, its legs like colossal pillars.  Silver markings covered its black shell, appearing chaotic at first glance, but upon closer inspection revealing a mysterious, almost hypnotic, pattern.</p><p>Its eyes like two moons, shone with intense light, fixing on the enemy, emitting low, rumbling roars like muffled thunder.</p><p>Guided by the roar, the water surged even faster, showing no sign of slowing, even as it approached the demons.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The demons, expecting this, remained calm.  Engulfed by the waves, they were instantly lifted by the black turtle’s form, rising above the water.</p><p>The water rippled as the black turtle manifestation transformed into a giant vessel.</p><p>Unharmed, the demons unleashed their powers, the air flashing with various colored lights.</p><p>Their coordination was clearly practiced, their different abilities now seamlessly integrated under the demon kings’ guidance.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Daoist cultivators charged, their force already creating large waves.</p><p>At this moment, intense Xuan light erupted from the black turtle’s form, spreading through the water.</p><p>The eight directions' waters turned inky black, rising high around the demons, coalescing into an eight-sided black water shield.  The shield spun rapidly as it formed.</p><p>Simultaneously, the demons were engulfed in the watery light, seemingly clad in black armor. Their power surged, feeling a divine empowerment, their abilities greatly enhanced.</p><p>The other demon kings also wielded their powers and treasures, assisting the black turtle apparition.</p><p>Finally, the strong enemy arrived!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A black rainbow collided head-on with the water shield.</p><p>The eight-sided shield solidified instantly, visible waves spreading outward. The residual shockwave possessed astonishing destructive power.</p><p>In an instant, space trembled violently. Half of the eight-sided shield shattered immediately, the rest sustaining varying degrees of damage.</p><p>Though the shield broke, it successfully stopped the black rainbow.</p><p>The escaping light dissipated, revealing the Daoist forces.</p><p>Their formation was largely unchanged from before.  Four Grand Masters, led by an old Daoist priest, stood on ritual platforms, positioned in the four cardinal directions. The other Masters and their troops guarded the flanks, their energies forming a unified whole.</p><p>Despite the ferocious impact, the formation only faltered slightly.  The four Grand Masters stepped on their platforms, and a green light swept across the battlefield, calming the chaotic energies.</p><p>Sensing the spatial tremors, the old Daoist priest narrowed his eyes, his gaze moving past the demons to fix on the White-robed Demon King.</p><p>Most of the tremors stemmed from their clash, but some originated from the auspicious clouds. The White-robed Demon King had done something, possibly making a discovery.</p><p>The old Daoist priest had no time to ponder, for the enemy's counterattack arrived.  The demons combined their powers to conjure a giant spear, piercing the air at high speed, aimed at the center of the Daoist formation.</p><p>The spear gradually turned black, its might increasing accordingly.</p><p>Even before the spear arrived, the Daoist forces felt the strong wind and their hearts trembled, their faces turning pale.</p><p>"Celestial Net Earthly Axis Talisman!"</p><p>The old Daoist priest roared, shaking his sleeve and producing a vermilion talisman.  He extended his index finger, and the talisman ignited spontaneously.</p><p>The other three Grand Masters, upon receiving the order, acted swiftly, producing identical talismans.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The four talismans burned to ashes, and the atmosphere of the battlefield shifted immediately.</p><p>The Masters and soldiers in the formation perceived the appearance of countless silver threads, crisscrossing everywhere.</p><p>The threads were dense and interwoven, enshrouding all the Daoist Masters and soldiers in a net.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spear shot down from the heavens.</p><p>The net rose, its threads coiling. The entire net contracted towards the spear.</p><p>In the next instant, the spearhead was entangled by countless threads, with more converging rapidly, enveloping half the spear in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The four Grand Masters manipulated hand seals, the other Masters and soldiers followed orders, constantly shifting formations, manipulating the talisman array to assist in activating the Celestial Net Earthly Axis Talisman.</p><p>The spear's momentum faltered, its speed noticeably slowing, still stubbornly trying to break through the net.</p><p>As the saying goes, momentum wanes, then fades completely. Compared to its initial might, the spear's threat was greatly diminished.</p><p>The three other Grand Masters withdrew their hand seals, leaving the old Daoist priest to defend against the spear alone.</p><p>Light streamed from the platforms beneath their feet; no verbal commands were needed; the other Masters and troops understood and shifted the formation. Some aided the old Daoist priest while the rest followed the three Grand Masters' commands.</p><p>A Grand Master in purple robes and a jade hairpin took charge, assisted by Ruochuan and another Grand Master. The troop movements were orderly, launching an attack.</p><p>Streams of light, encompassing divine techniques and magical treasures, rained down on the demons.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Daoist formation advanced step by step behind these attacks.</p><p>The demons' counterattack was equally fierce. The black turtle apparition served as the anchor, continuing to suppress with the black spear.</p><p>The remaining demon kings led the demons in shifting formations.  Those skilled in divine techniques positioned themselves at the rear, while those with powerful physiques formed the vanguard, splitting into several units under their respective kings, encircling the Daoist formation and launching a frenzied assault.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Water waves engulfed the battlefield, the water level steadily rising, waves crashing continuously.</p><p>The battlefield blazed with the light of divine techniques and magical treasures, the cries of battle shook the heavens, figures blurred, the chaos making it impossible to ascertain which side had the upper hand.</p><p>Casualties quickly mounted; blood spread through the water; severed limbs occasionally floated to the surface, only to be swallowed by the waves, dissolving into bloody water.</p><p>The brutal fighting continued unabated.</p><p>The purple-robed Master, his left thumb pressed against his ring finger, moved like lightning, constantly shifting on his platform, each step following a precise pattern – the art of step-based maneuvering.</p><p>The art of manipulating the guiding principles, a cornerstone of Daoist practice.</p><p>The art of *bugang* involves harnessing righteous energy to control the elements.  The *jue mu* focuses on spiritual strategy and transformation.  Cultivation and subjugation of spirits rely entirely on these techniques.</p><p>Zipao Zhenren was currently employing the *Pili Jiezhou Sha Gui Gang* technique, each step changing the battlefield.  The cultivators within the formation became his brush and ink, painting talismans and streams of light that cut down the enemy like swords.</p><p>The flourishing of *bugang* techniques began after the Second Divine Thunder Assembly, when the Daoist Heavenly Court underwent a significant restructuring.</p><p>*Bugang*, also known as *bu tiangang*, *bugang*, *ta dou bugang*, and *bu gang nie ji*, is a crucial Daoist technique.</p><p>"Dou" refers to the Big Dipper, and "gang" originally meant the last star in the Dipper's handle. This technique allows communication with deities and summoning of spirits, even petitioning the Emperor.  Unfortunately, with the decline of the Heavenly Court, these *bugang* techniques are no longer effective.</p><p>Zipao Zhenren moved with powerful *bugang* steps, seizing demonic life force, his imposing presence striking fear into the hearts of the demon cultivators.</p><p>Though outnumbered and outmatched in overall strength, the Daoists maintained a disciplined formation. The four Grand Masters' troops were elite, and under the combined protection of *bugang* techniques and a constant stream of talismans, they formed a cohesive fighting unit, capable of withstanding attacks.</p><p>However, each advance came at a terrible cost, with the Daoist formation facing ferocious counterattacks, pushing them to the brink of collapse at every step.</p><p>Amidst the carnage, only one person remained calm.</p><p>The White-robed Demon King sat serenely on a cloud, unaffected by the battle behind him. The half-edict in his hand pulsed with light, brightening and dimming, each flash causing spatial tremors emanating from deep within the cloud.</p><p>An old Daoist priest intently watched the White-robed Demon King, observing the half-edict's fluctuations, lost in thought, his lips moving slightly.</p><p>Zipao Zhenren, receiving a message, subtly altered his command, slowing the advance and tightening the formation.</p><p>The old Daoist did not rush to destroy the giant spear, but gazed long at the cloud's depths, occasionally glancing at the White-robed Demon King's back.</p><p>The shouting continued, though less intense than before.</p><p>Then, the White-robed Scholar touched the edict. It rose slowly, rotating above his head, the tremors in the cloud intensifying many times over.</p><p>The old Daoist's eyes gleamed.  He took a step forward, his aura shifting.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators instantly sensed the change, instinctively altering their formation under his guidance.</p><p>The old Daoist moved swiftly, employing a different *bugang* technique, the *Chi Shui Du Guan Gang*.</p><p>He chanted the incantation:</p><p>"I solemnly command, swift and true,</p><p>Burn the Heavenly Emperor through.</p><p>Green Dragon on my left, White Tiger on my right,</p><p>A thousand-li net in front, a white sun sword in sight.</p><p>Summon five dragons from five directions, into this water I call.</p><p>Evil spirits, be subdued, not one shall act at all.</p><p>Quickly, quickly, as the law ordains!"</p><p>Suddenly, darkness fell. The old Daoist halted, his fingers forming a sword, pointing downwards.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Daoist formation launched no attack. The demons, initially confused, felt something amiss.</p><p>The Black Tortoise manifested waves, and the battle continued underwater, both sides submerged.</p><p>While the demon cultivators drew power from the water, their enhancement vanished.</p><p>Simultaneously, a roar, filled with rage and shock, echoed among the cultivators.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Waves rose around them.  Within the churning water, gigantic, elongated shadows writhed, five in all, nearly encircling the battlefield.</p><p>As the shadows solidified, revealing their forms, the cultivators gasped – five true dragons!</p><p>Formed from water, their scales shimmered, yet they exuded no weakness.</p><p>'Splash! Splash! Splash!'</p><p>The dragons played in the water, each roll creating enormous waves.</p><p>The Black Tortoise's face turned ashen. The water element he summoned was partly beyond his control, as though the five water dragons had seized its authority.</p><p>Furthermore, the old Daoist flicked his whisk, and the dragons, eyes blazing, lunged at the demon cultivators.</p><p>Turning the enemy's strength against them!</p><p>Enraged, the Black Tortoise roared, creating even larger waves to batter the dragons.</p><p>Despite this, the demon cultivators' advantage in the water dwindled, while the Daoists' morale surged.</p><p>Amidst the churning waters,</p><p>The battlefield slowly shifted towards the cloud.</p><p>Then, two Demon King manifestations soared into the air.</p><p>These two, previously stationed in the rear, had remained inconspicuous.  Their sudden movement immediately drew the Daoists’ attention.</p><p>The old Daoist's gaze shifted from the White-robed Demon King, his brow furrowed as he observed the two.</p><p>Instantly, a chilling dread gripped everyone on the battlefield.  Blood seemed to freeze in their veins.</p><p>In the distance,</p><p>A crimson flame streaked across the sky.</p><p>Enveloping a giant boulder, it resembled a meteorite, piercing illusions, hurtling towards the battlefield.</p>
