<h1>Chapter 756: Ambush</h1><p>The blade energy forced its way out of his body.</p><p>After taking the pill, Qin Sang's complexion visibly improved.</p><p>He looked at his Golden Light Armor; several dents marred its surface, almost rendering it unusable.  He put it away and changed into a magic robe.</p><p>Then he checked on the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa had several gaping holes in its body and was barely alive.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense and breathed a sigh of relief.  The Flying Night Rakshasa's injuries looked horrific, but fortunately, no vital parts were affected.</p><p>He directed the two-headed… beast to… retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind him; Cui Ji was gone.</p><p>He still felt a lingering resentment.  He had risked the destruction of both his Golden Light Armor and the Flying Night Rakshasa, even forgoing the use of the two-headed… beast at the most dangerous moment to try and lure the enemy deeper, but the explosion had ruined everything.</p><p>As long as Cui Ji lived, Qin Sang felt a constant prickling unease.</p><p>However, now the enemy was out in the open, and he was hidden.</p><p>He looked away, controlled his spirit sword, and worked with the two-headed… beast.</p><p>They chose a different direction. The battlefield was in utter chaos; Cui Ji would never expect Qin Sang not only survived but also had the strength to break through.</p><p>A fierce battle ensued.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see what lay ahead; he could only choose a direction and charge.</p><p>Later, he noticed traces of other ferocious beasts, but far fewer than the Purple Star Eagles.  It seemed only the Purple Star Eagles were deliberately sent, the others attracted by the smell of blood.</p><p>"Finally, an opening."</p><p>Qin Sang split a beast in two with his sword.</p><p>The beasts relentlessly pursued him. Qin Sang observed for a while, seeing nothing unusual, recalled the two-headed… beast, and concealed his presence, going into hiding.</p><p>With the Detox Armor on, Qin Sang didn't need to use his true energy to protect himself.</p><p>He hid in the shadows, holding his breath, carefully avoiding the beasts' line of sight. He watched as groups of ferocious beasts circled relentlessly, with more continuously charging in from the outside.</p><p>Without something like the Bone Lotus and the Detox Armor, even the strongest cultivator would be worn down and killed here.</p><p>The beasts lost Qin Sang's trail, abandoned the chase, and joined the melee.</p><p>The battlefield was no longer just Purple Star Eagles hunting cultivators.</p><p>As more and more ferocious beasts were drawn in, these blood-crazed, irrational creatures went completely wild, killing indiscriminately, friend or foe.</p><p>The place had become a bloody grinder, a river of blood staining the earth, a scene that would likely continue for an unknown time.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang escaped the beasts, standing on the edge of the battlefield. Blood flowed under his feet.  He listened to the beasts' frenzied roars, feeling a lingering sense of fear.</p><p>He stood there, not immediately retreating from the Purple Mist Wasteland, turning towards the stone hall, his expression shifting.</p><p>After breaking through the encirclement, his energy consumption wasn't too great, and his strength was well-preserved.  He didn't want to leave just yet.</p><p>Cui Ji thought he was dead; this was his chance.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then quietly approached the stone hall.</p><p>The two most likely places for Cui Ji were the stone hall and the location of the explosion; these two places weren't far apart.</p><p>He avoided the beasts and the battlefield, cautiously approaching. He soon discovered the stone hall was surrounded by beasts, but the explosion site seemed less chaotic.</p><p>Midway, Qin Sang's palm closed slightly, and three Ten Directions Yan Luo Banners slipped into his hand.</p><p>Once he made his move, it would be a thunderous attack, giving his opponent no chance to breathe.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A few Purple Star Eagles were attacking a Dire Wolf.  The Purple Star Eagles' giant wings flapped repeatedly as they soared, while the Dire Wolf, its body radiating a yellow light, stood its ground, its body covered in wounds, yet refusing to flee.</p><p>The chaos caused the Purple Mist to churn.  Qin Sang, quietly approaching, vaguely saw two figures. He froze, his expression subtly changing.</p><p>The Dire Wolf let out a mournful howl, its spine crushed by the Purple Star Eagles, which then proceeded to devour it, leaving only a skeleton in moments.</p><p>The Purple Mist closed in. Qin Sang clenched his fist and silently moved forward, calculating the distance, and lurking near the two figures. Though the Purple Mist provided cover, Qin Sang didn't dare get too close, lest he be caught off guard.</p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, one of them was Cui Ji.</p><p>The other, unexpectedly, was Xiang Yi!</p><p>He had thought Xiang Yi was dead, even his Bone Lotus taken. It was only a fleeting glimpse that revealed both Xiang Yi and Cui Ji each possessed a Bone Lotus.</p><p>This greatly surprised Qin Sang. Xiang Yi was working with Cui Ji, secretly and openly; both were from the Merchant Alliance.  No wonder Cui Ji was so confident, daring to kill in the midst of the chaos.</p><p>These two old foxes hadn't shown a single flaw along the way!</p><p>Qin Sang was furious and curious.</p><p>Were Xiang Yi and Cui Ji behind this beast attack? If the Merchant League orchestrated this, what was the point?  They're minor players, not core members. The League could have killed them easily without all this trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, replaying the scene in her mind.  Xiang Yi and Cui Ji stood near a large crater. It wasn't there when they were clearing the stone hall earlier; it must have been caused by an explosion.</p><p>"There's something lying motionless by the crater," she murmured. "It's the subterranean beast.  It looks dead."</p><p>She couldn't get too close, so she only saw its outline, but the beast was easily identifiable.</p><p>"Wait… there's something else at their feet… a body.  Or… what's left of one.  Just the upper half…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened.  A thought struck her.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>The cultivator with the half-mask, the one from the Pan clan!</p><p>Just then, she heard a commotion in the distance – someone breaking through.  She retreated quietly.</p><p>Soon, she heard Xiang Yi's cold voice.  "An Daoyou, you're late."</p><p>Purple mist swirled.</p><p>A richly dressed, stout man burst through the mist, escaping the beast.  Catching his breath, he looked at Cui Ji, frowning. "Cui Ji, you sent me to scout while you went after Qingfeng Daochang alone?  Didn't you discuss this with Xiang Daoyou beforehand?"</p><p>Cui Ji chuckled nervously, shaking his head.  He started to explain, but Xiang Yi's furious glare silenced him.  He visibly trembled.</p><p>"You dared to kill Qingfeng Daochang without permission! I told you to wait until the mission was complete! Did you ignore me?"</p><p>Xiang Yi glared, his voice sharp with anger.</p><p>Cui Ji shrank back, whispering, "Xiang Daoyou, you saw how powerful his escape technique was.  Even without his full strength, he was on par with you. When he went all out, he was the fastest cultivator I've ever seen at the Golden Core stage.  If we failed, he could easily escape.  But the poisonous mist and the Purple Star Hawks limited his escape. It was a golden opportunity…"</p>
