<h1>Chapter 1105: An Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>The world of cultivation is ever-changing and unpredictable. Before leaving, he had left Meigu with only a meager amount of resources, which, for a sect, was akin to a drop in the ocean. Yet, this seemingly frail sect, located in the heart of demonic territory, had managed to survive until now without perishing. Over the course of a century-long war, many of the once-top sects and powers had declined, and countless others had been wiped out entirely. Among them, the once-dominant Pure Yang Sect of the Little Cold Domain had gradually weakened after the fall of the Red-Haired Ancestor. In contrast, the status of Shaohua Mountain and Dongyang Bo had risen steadily. The rise and fall of sects were as natural as the changing of seasons, but it was a mystery how the Demonic Flame Sect had managed to survive in such a precarious position.</p><p>"So you're a disciple of the Demonic Flame Sect," Qin Sang nodded, his tone amiable. "Many years ago, I had a brief encounter with a fellow cultivator named Meigu, who also hailed from the Demonic Flame Sect. I heard she even became the sect's leader."</p><p>"Senior knows our Sect Leader, Aunt Meigu?" the young man exclaimed in surprise. "This junior has been rude and blind. Please forgive my ignorance, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively, showing no concern, and continued, "Is Meigu still the leader of the Demonic Flame Sect? When we first met, she was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. After so many years, she must have reached the Golden Core stage by now, right?"</p><p>The young man nodded repeatedly. "Sect Leader Aunt Meigu formed her Golden Core many years ago. This junior's current cultivation is largely thanks to her guidance."</p><p>"I remember back then, Meigu often spoke of the Demonic Flame Sect with great concern. For her to lead the sect to where it is today while also advancing to the Golden Core stage is truly remarkable," Qin Sang remarked with genuine admiration.</p><p>His words came from the heart. Reflecting on his own journey, he recalled how arduous it had been to form his Golden Core, leaving him no room to focus on external matters. Qin Sang had nearly forgotten about the Demonic Flame Sect and Meigu, yet they had managed to survive like tenacious weeds in the ruthless world of cultivation.</p><p>The young man's eyes flickered as he added, "Sect Leader Aunt Meigu once said that the sect's survival isn't solely her doing. It's largely thanks to the protection of our Ancestor."</p><p>"The Demonic Flame Sect's Ancestor? I believe Meigu mentioned him once. But I heard that the Ancestor has been away for a long time and hasn't made an appearance in years," Qin Sang said, his tone calm but his gaze sharp.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was also familiar with the Demonic Flame Sect's Ancestor, the young man's suspicions gradually faded. He hesitated before saying, "This junior has never seen the Ancestor in person, but I've heard Sect Leader Aunt Meigu mention him many times. Due to certain circumstances, the Ancestor cannot reveal himself, but he has been silently guarding the sect from the shadows."</p><p>Qin Sang could see through the young man's words. Even the young man himself didn't seem to fully believe what he was saying. After all, if the Ancestor hadn't shown himself for so long, he was likely long dead. However, whether Meigu was using the Ancestor's name as a shield or for some other reason, at least she hadn't forgotten about him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked a few more questions. By this point, even a fool could tell that Qin Sang was no ordinary figure. Outside, the heavens raged with violent phenomena, yet within the vast shelter, all the cultivators remained silent, secretly observing Qin Sang and the young man.</p><p>Less than an hour later, the celestial phenomena began to subside. Qin Sang glanced outside, then stood up and walked out.</p><p>"Senior!" the young man hurried after him, bowing deeply. "May I ask for your esteemed name? This junior will report to Sect Leader Aunt Meigu immediately. She will surely be overjoyed to hear news of an old friend."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly and replied indifferently, "This humble Daoist is known as Qingfeng. If I find the time, I will pay a personal visit."</p><p>With that, Qin桑's figure flickered a few times before disappearing into the storm.</p><p>The young man stood in place, frowning as he stared in the direction Qin桑 had vanished, muttering the name "Qingfeng" under his breath. Soon after, his three companions caught up with him.</p><p>"Where did the Senior go?" the enchanting woman asked, her voice filled with doubt. "Was he really a Golden Core expert? No wonder my charm techniques had no effect on him..."</p><p>The young man glanced at her and warned, "You should be more cautious in the future. Right now, we're like monkeys pretending to be kings in the absence of tigers, but we never know when we might run into someone truly formidable. Thankfully, the Senior was magnanimous."</p><p>The enchanting woman nodded repeatedly, her heart still pounding with fear. Another cultivator asked, "Why did that Senior approach you? Do you have some connection with him?"</p><p>The young man shook his head. "From the Senior's tone, it seems he has some past ties with Sect Leader Aunt Meigu. He recognized the 'Seven Suns Art' I cultivate. Fellow Daoists, I must return to the sect to report this to Sect Leader Aunt Meigu. I won't be able to accompany you this time..."</p><p>...</p><p>After leaving the shelter, Qin桑 headed straight for Yin Mountain Pass, lost in thought. The unexpected news about the Demonic Flame Sect had given him some new ideas. Shaohua Mountain was thriving, and until he had the strength to face Dongyang Bo, he dared not reveal his true origins. However, his cultivation level was something he couldn't hide. With the two-domain alliance and the Sin Abyss in a tense standoff, once the situation escalated, no individual or faction would be able to remain neutral—not even rogue cultivators. Unless he hid away in a cave and successfully formed his Nascent Soul, he would inevitably be drawn into the conflict.</p><p>He was close to regaining his late Golden Core cultivation. With such power, as soon as he revealed himself, the two-domain alliance would surely take notice. In a collapsing nest, no egg remains unbroken. If they pressured him with righteous causes and he refused, he would become an enemy of both domains. Before that happened, he needed to prepare a suitable identity. The Demonic Flame Sect's Ancestor was a good option. However, the sect had been built up largely by Meigu's efforts, and taking over would be akin to stealing the fruits of her labor. Qin桑 didn't believe the sect truly revered him as their Ancestor. Still, if possible, the Demonic Flame Sect could serve as a foundation for building his own power base, giving him the means to rival Dongyang Bo after forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Using force to dominate others was not the way; it would only breed resentment. He needed to provide a proper explanation to both the Demonic Flame Sect and Meigu. This matter required careful planning.</p><p>By evening, Qin桑 arrived at a bustling market outside Yin Mountain Pass and found the black market. As expected, there were methods to disguise one's identity and evade scrutiny. After successfully blending in as a rogue cultivator, Qin桑 didn't rush to leave. Instead, he frequently interacted with various merchant guilds, purchasing the spiritual materials he needed while gathering information. Eventually, he gained a clear understanding of the current state of the cultivation world.</p><p>One thing surprised him: after leaving the Purple Micro Palace, Shaohua Mountain had never issued a warrant for his arrest. Whether it was because Dongyang Bo had been too preoccupied with the Sin Abyss invasion to remember the matter or for some other reason, Qin桑 couldn't be sure. In contrast to the Canglang Sea, the demon cores and bones he had accumulated while hunting demons in the Demon Sea were highly valuable and scarce in the Little Cold Domain. To avoid arousing suspicion, Qin桑 only exchanged a small portion of his stash for the materials he needed and left the rest untouched, including the Demonic Core Pills.</p><p>With the idea of taking over the Demonic Flame Sect and building his own power base, he needed to carefully consider how to use these Demonic Core Pills. After making his decision, Qin桑 left the city and found a secluded spot to inscribe a new killing talisman, restoring his cultivation to the mid-Golden Core stage. Then, he set off again, flying straight out of the swamp's edge and into the Ten Thousand Mountains.</p><p>After a long flight, Qin桑 arrived at a desolate snow-covered mountain. This was where Tan Hao's former cave was located.</p>
