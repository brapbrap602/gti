<h1>Chapter 1115: The Life Talisman</h1><p>Chapter 1115: The Life Talisman</p><p>*啪!*</p><p>The chief shaman searched in vain, then after a moment's thought, gently placed the stone disc into the recess.</p><p>*咔咔…*</p><p>Without further action, the stone disc began to rotate on its own, accelerating rapidly.</p><p>*轰隆隆…*</p><p>The next moment, the heavy stone slabs slowly slid open to reveal a doorway before them.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone exchanged surprised glances.</p><p>They hadn't expected the stone gate to open so easily.</p><p>They did not dare to be careless and instead of rushing in, they each summoned their protective talismans, eyes fixed on the stone chamber, prepared for anything.</p><p>The chamber was dimly lit and utterly silent.</p><p>An unknown barrier seemed to block their spiritual senses, preventing any investigation.</p><p>The chief shaman hesitated for a moment, gesturing for everyone to remain outside, then prepared to enter the chamber.</p><p>Kuyu Chan flitted to the front, saying calmly, "Your escape techniques are inferior to mine. I'll scout ahead. However, let me be clear, if it doesn't contain what you seek, I'll leave immediately.  You promised me..."</p><p>The chief shaman interrupted Fang Laomo, saying sternly, "Daoist Fang, do not worry. Whatever the outcome, I will keep my word."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Kuyu Chan silently flew into the chamber, disappearing from sight.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Seven Kills Hall, in the white jade plaza.</p><p>The inner chamber entrance opened.</p><p>Lingzhuzi’s gaze fell on the assembled Yuan Ying masters. "The inner chamber is unclaimed; I shall temporarily take charge. The rules of the Trial Realm, I presume, are clear to you all. Within the Canglang Sea, all cultivators who have successfully achieved Yuan Ying have one chance to enter the Trial Realm.  Those who have not yet participated, and wish to enter this time, please step forward."</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>More than twenty Yuan Ying cultivators from the front row stepped forward together.</p><p>Seeing this, a look of surprise flickered across Lingzhuzi's eyes. "The number of cultivators participating in the trial this time is far greater than in previous openings. Daoist Wenxian, I recall you only achieved Yuan Ying less than forty years ago. To participate in the trial so soon, is that not rather rash?"</p><p>Lingzhuzi addressed a Daoist directly, questioning him.</p><p>The Daoist carried a seven-star treasure sword on his back; his features were unusual.  He seemed to share some history with Lingzhuzi, and after respectfully bowing, he replied, "There are rumors that the increasingly shorter intervals between the openings of the Seven Kills Hall are due to changes in the Celestial Ban, and that unknown changes will occur in the future. Even if I cultivate for another few hundred years, I may still have little hope of passing the trial; by then, the Trial Realm may not even exist.  I'm afraid that if I miss this opportunity, I'll never have another chance. Even without the rewards, gaining knowledge would be worthwhile…"</p><p>"Indeed, we share Daoist Wenxian's concerns. If we wait any longer, the Seven Kills Hall might cease to exist altogether. Your understanding of the Seven Kills Hall surely surpasses ours. Can you shed some light on these repeated changes?"</p><p>Other Yuan Ying cultivators echoed Daoist Wenxian's sentiments.</p><p>Some looked towards Lingzhuzi, others towards the Demon Lord.</p><p>Lingzhuzi chuckled. "The Trial Realm was established by our predecessors using the power of the Celestial Ban, a boon to future generations. Once created, no one can alter it.  The deepest parts of the inner chamber are filled with ancient prohibitions, countless secrets hidden within. We human cultivators have explored less than a tenth of it. What I know is no more than you all.  However, my observation suggests that aside from the shortened intervals, the Seven Kills Hall shows no other abnormalities. The timing of the inner chamber's opening is never fixed, though the fluctuations have been greater in the last two instances. The more frequently the Seven Kills Hall opens, the more opportunities we have to enter the inner chamber—perhaps that's not a bad thing…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Yuan Ying cultivators fell silent, but none withdrew.</p><p>Lingzhuzi paused, then continued, "Since you have all made up your minds, please enter through the right-hand door…"</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>A corpulent elder bowed to Lingzhuzi. "Daoist Lingzhu, I wish to relinquish my trial opportunity and give my place to a junior."</p><p>Lingzhuzi looked puzzled. "Daoist Mu, your junior can freely enter the Trial Realm for training, without restriction… eh?  You wouldn't be thinking of…"</p><p>The corpulent elder nodded. "Indeed, I recall that the Trial Realm has a rule: if I give up my place, I can obtain a Life Talisman and bestow it upon a younger generation."</p><p>This statement caused an uproar.</p><p>An elder in gray robes sighed. "Old Mu, so that’s why you brought that girl! Everyone only gets one chance at the trial. You're really willing to do this!"</p><p>The corpulent elder responded calmly, "If the Seven Kills Hall opened normally, I would still have some hope of receiving a reward in a hundred years or so. Forcing my way in would only be wasting a valuable opportunity."</p><p>"My friend, you're mistaken. Even without the reward, entering the trial realm will benefit you greatly.  Very few have made the same choice you have over the years."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi shook his head, trying to persuade the stout elder.</p><p>The stout elder bowed.  "My mind is set. Please, Master, instruct me on how to obtain the Life Talisman."</p><p>Seeing this, Ling Zhuzi said no more, pointing to the plaque.</p><p>"Friend, do this..."</p><p>The stout elder stepped forward and reached into the pillar of light.</p><p>A moment later, the pillar of light brightened slightly, and a point of green light flew from the plaque, gently settling in the elder's palm – a crystalline jade token.</p><p>In the center of the token was a blood-red ancient character – 'Life'.</p><p>The stout elder's face lit up. He stepped down, handing the Life Talisman to the young woman.</p><p>Only then did the young woman understand the great price her grandfather had paid for her, her hand clutching the talisman tightly, her expression resolute.</p><p>Envious glances fell upon the young woman.</p><p>Though most didn't know the Life Talisman's use, knowing that a Yuan Ying master had given up their place to obtain it, it must be incredibly useful in the trial realm.  She has a Yuan Ying ancestor looking out for her. That's something to be envied.</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing the discussions amongst the cultivators, didn't understand much. This confirmed that the Life Talisman must be exceptionally rare, known to very few.</p><p>"Please, esteemed cultivators…"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi gestured.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators preparing for the trial entered the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Before the hall stood an invisible barrier.  As each person passed through, the barrier glowed faintly, and then their figures vanished.</p><p>Once the last Yuan Ying master entered the hall, Ling Zhuzi turned to the group of Jindan cultivators, saying calmly, "With your cultivation, wandering the inner hall would be a death sentence. According to the rules, all Jindan cultivators must successfully complete at least three trials to gain recognition. Therefore, to enter the inner hall, you must first enter the trial realm."</p>
