<h1>Chapter 296: Hunter and Hunted</h1><p>Moments later, the Spirit Bamboo flying boat broke through the sea of fire and stopped abruptly before him.</p><p>Qin Sang lunged, thrusting his Ebony Sword forward, while Wandering Scholar countered with his own magical artifact.  Their spiritual power howled as they exchanged blows, a seemingly thrilling duel, yet both remained in control, their battle a mere facade.</p><p>As they pretended to fight, they swiftly communicated through divine sense.</p><p>Only after this exchange did Qin Sang learn the truth.</p><p>It turned out that when Qin Sang sent his message using the Linked Heart Pendant, Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan had already received intel from their inside sources, and their groups had happened to clash.</p><p>By then, it was impossible for Wandering Scholar and Ge Yuan to break away. However, learning about Yu Kong's trap from Qin Sang, they devised an escape plan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the true chaos erupted, Luo Xingnan had been prepared. He unleashed a Talisman Treasure, crippling a Hook Serpent King.  Witnessing this, Wandering Scholar immediately suspected foul play and abandoned his initial plan of escaping alone, choosing instead to remain undercover by Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>Before escaping, Luo Xingnan even managed to sabotage Sheng Yuanzi, which explained the latter's swift demise.</p><p>Ultimately, due to the overwhelming power of the Hook Serpents, most perished, leaving only five survivors.</p><p>Luo Xingnan feigned his death, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The roles were reversed. Yu Kong, the hunter, became the hunted, while Luo Xingnan took his place as the hunter.</p><p>“Amidst the chaos, I helped Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan escape. He's currently outside the barrier, still holding the Linked Heart Pendant. Let Luo Xingnan scout the path for now. Rendezvous with Ge Yuan and await my instructions...”</p><p>Wandering Scholar explained.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated their situation, his brow furrowing.</p><p>They were only three.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was the sole Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator.  Combined with Elder Gong and the other two, their strength was several times greater than their own.  Now with their ranks bolstered, Shangguan Lifeng was also on Luo Xingnan's side. Wu Chen had been captured alive, and Yan Wu's fate remained unknown.</p><p>The disparity between them was immense. Even with the element of surprise, achieving anything substantial within the mountain would be difficult.</p><p>"Has Junior Brother Qin noticed anything unusual about the spiritual herbs' aura? I suspect there aren't as many on the mountain as it seems, and they may not be enough to share," Wandering Scholar added another piece of unwelcome news.</p><p>“What have you discovered, Senior?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely, aware that a shortage of spiritual herbs would inevitably lead to conflict.</p><p>Wandering Scholar shook his head, saying, "I can't be certain yet, but most of the auras seem too weak and dim, unlike what one would expect from thousand-year-old herbs.  However, I'm unsure of other restrictions on the mountain; the light may not accurately reflect the herbs' true aura. We must still prepare for the worst."</p><p>Hailing from the Taiyi Pill Sect, Wandering Scholar possessed profound knowledge of alchemy. His assessment suggested a high degree of certainty.</p><p>Qin Sang abandoned any lingering hope and contemplated their options.</p><p>Their opponents were powerful. Snatching their prize from their jaws would require careful planning.</p><p>Even if the chances were slim, they had to give it their all.</p><p>"From my observation, those three may not be entirely loyal to Luo Xingnan.  The scholar in white doesn't seem connected to him.  He’s likely a rogue cultivator caught in the crossfire.  When we were surrounded by the Hook Serpents, Luo Xingnan showed no concern for his safety. The scholar's escape technique is exceptional.  He relies on incredibly agile movements, avoiding injury and managing to keep up.</p><p>The man with the hooked nose is surnamed Yin.  Originally one of Sheng Yuanzi's men, he's remarkably decisive. To survive, he betrayed Sheng Yuanzi on the spot and joined Luo Xingnan's side.</p><p>Only Elder Gong, sent by Luo Xingnan to infiltrate Sheng Yuanzi's group, has deep ties with him and enjoys his full trust. He was the only one Luo Xingnan specifically brought along.”</p><p>Wandering Scholar briefly described Luo Xingnan's allies.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt somewhat relieved.</p><p>Their opponents were not a united front.  Except for Elder Gong, the other two could be swayed. With sufficient incentive, they could be persuaded to betray Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Neither he nor Wandering Scholar were greedy, seeking only the herbs they needed.  If necessary, they could even offer alternatives for trade.</p><p>But if the mountain's herbs weren't enough to satisfy Luo Xingnan, would he willingly share?</p><p>As the strongest among them, with allies at his side, Luo Xingnan could easily seize the lion's share, leaving only scraps for his followers.</p><p>The others, a disorganized bunch, wouldn't dare challenge him.</p><p>With a little manipulation, they could sow discord among them.</p><p>“What does Junior Brother Qin know about Yu Kong's people?”</p><p>Wandering Scholar inquired, adding pointedly, "Shangguan Lifeng… Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan didn't know Shao Chunhui had a disciple.  I wonder about this disciple's character?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication.</p><p>If Shangguan Lifeng were grateful, after Luo Xingnan avenged his master, he would undoubtedly be loyal and impossible to sway.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly reviewed his memories, finding his impression of Shangguan Lifeng quite vague. The man was quiet, always immersed in honing his blade skills, rarely interacting with others.</p><p>Unless it was an act, someone with such a personality was unlikely to betray their loyalty.</p><p>Qin Sang shared his assessment with Wandering Scholar.</p><p>They categorized him as part of Luo Xingnan's group.</p><p>“Wu Chen is definitely a rogue cultivator,” Qin Sang paused, then continued, “The one who escaped with me is called Yan Wu. He's Yu Kong's trusted subordinate.”</p><p>"Luo Xingnan, Elder Gong, and Shangguan Lifeng; you, me, and Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan, along with Yin and the scholar in white, plus Wu Chen…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar’s tone grew lighter.  “If Junior Brother Qin can find a chance to steal the herbs, that's ideal. Even in a direct confrontation, six against three, we still have a chance. Others might get injured or even die while navigating the barriers, as Luo Xingnan wouldn’t risk his own men… However, with the right timing, our strength won't be far inferior to Luo Xingnan's.  There's hope yet!  Every additional person strengthens our side. Rescuing Yan Wu would be a significant advantage.”</p><p>Their divine sense communication was incredibly fast. Despite the lengthy exchange, only a few moments had passed. There was still time to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, but ultimately agreed.</p><p>His conflict with Yan Wu was minor.  He hadn't suffered any real loss, so there was no need to dwell on it.</p><p>His previous wariness stemmed from Yu Kong's presence. Now that Yu Kong was dead and Yan Wu had lost his backing, he no longer considered him a threat.</p><p>Wandering Scholar was right; securing the herbs was paramount. The bigger picture mattered most.</p><p>This didn't mean Qin Sang fully trusted Yan Wu. He would use him to counter Luo Xingnan while remaining vigilant of his actions.</p><p>Without hesitation, they sheathed their artifacts and boarded Wandering Scholar's Spirit Bamboo flying boat.</p>
