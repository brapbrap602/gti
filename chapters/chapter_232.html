<h1>Chapter 225: Reunion</h1><p>Chapter 225: Reunion</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A storm, thunder, sky fire, snowstorm...</p><p>All kinds of celestial phenomena came in turn. The earth shook, and the waves churned.</p><p>The small lake couldn't stay peaceful under the dreadful celestial phenomena. It seemed unusually vulnerable.</p><p>The shelter in the small lake had been reinforced and repaired by countless cultivators. It had existed for who knows how many years. Qin Sang had hidden in the small lake many times. The shelter had always been as stable as Mount Tai. This was the first time he had seen such a scene.</p><p>He and the Cloud Wanderer had no more desire to chat. They tried their best to maintain the shelter's restriction. He said with a serious expression, "The force of celestial phenomena seems to be growing stronger. The force of this celestial phenomena is several times stronger than the past. The fellow cultivators in the depths of the ancient immortal battlefield are afraid they will suffer badly..."</p><p>As they moved deeper into the ancient immortal battlefield, the space became even more unstable. The destructive power of the celestial phenomena became even more terrifying.</p><p>General shelters wouldn't be able to withstand the impact of this celestial phenomenon.</p><p>"This is the prelude to the spirit tide."</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer had a deep gaze. He looked through the lake water at the dark clouds, thunderbolts, and storm above. He sighed and said, "They say only those who have experienced the spirit tide's eruption know the so-called catastrophic power..."</p><p>"Spirit tide?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised. In recent years, he had heard people mention the spirit tide's existence.</p><p>It was said that the spirit tide was also a type of celestial phenomena on the ancient immortal battlefield. It was just the most dreadful celestial phenomena. When the spirit tide arrived, there was no safe place on the ancient immortal battlefield unless you were very confident in your strength and luck. Otherwise, the best way was to leave the ancient immortal battlefield and hide in Seven Heroes Pass. Explore again after the spirit tide ended.</p><p>Fortunately, each spirit tide eruption was often hundreds of years apart. Most cultivators wouldn't see a spirit tide erupt in their lifetime.</p><p>The spirit tide brought extreme destruction, but it could also be an opportunity. Many secret realm legacies were affected by the spirit tide's impact, causing their restrictions to be damaged and space to be unbalanced. As a result, they were exposed during the spirit tide. Those were secret realm legacies that had not been ransacked yet. They contained ancient immortal inheritances and countless treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw that the thunderbolts were becoming less frequent when he followed the Cloud Wanderer's gaze. Cracks were appearing in the dark clouds. Sunlight was spilling in. He knew that the power of the celestial phenomena was starting to weaken.</p><p>He calculated that if the spirit tide really appeared, it was best to enter Xuanlan Pass in advance. After all, it wasn't safe to stay in the secret realm. With his strength, he wouldn't dare to remain active on the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>As for secret realm legacies, only people who were extremely lucky would be able to encounter them. Instead of looking forward to such an unreliable thing, he might as well cultivate honestly.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also clearly knew that so-called signs were only indications. It might take dozens or even hundreds of years for the spirit tide to truly arrive. It was a little like worrying for nothing at the moment.</p><p>Instantly, the clouds and rain dispersed. The sky was clear and sunny.</p><p>The sun was shining brightly. It was extremely peaceful outside as if the doomsday-like scene from before had never happened.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Cloud Wanderer repaired the damaged restrictions in the shelter. Then, they boarded the spiritual bamboo flying boat and flew toward the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm. After the celestial phenomenon ended, the cloud beasts returned to their nests. They could easily handle the scattered cloud beasts they encountered on the way.</p><p>In less than two days, they arrived at the entrance of the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang brought the Cloud Wanderer into the secret realm. He stood at the entrance and asked the guard to invite Teng Nan over. The guard didn't leave long before they suddenly saw three beams of light flying from the depths of the secret realm.</p><p>Two of the beams of light looked a little familiar. Qin Sang thought for a moment and recalled the identities of the masters of the beams of light. He revealed a surprised expression on his face.</p><p>The beams of light instantly arrived and three people landed in front of them.</p><p>The leader was Senior Brother Teng Nan. He greeted Qin Sang and walked toward the Cloud Wanderer to examine his Shadow Guard token. The other two people were actually Mu Yifeng and Yun Qiong Scattered Person!</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, you didn't expect it to be us, right?"</p><p>Mu Yifeng laughed heartily and patted Qin Sang's shoulder in a friendly manner. "I heard that you've been in this ghost place for over twenty years. I haven't had time to visit you. Junior Brother Qin's aura has become much more steady than before. Sect Brother Teng hasn't mistreated you, right? If you have any grievances, just tell me. Senior Brother will definitely help you vent your anger!"</p><p>Teng Nan turned his head and smiled bitterly. "Senior Brother Mu is speaking unfairly. I wouldn't dare to mistreat Junior Brother Qin. The cave abode I arranged for Junior Brother Qin is the best in the secret realm."</p><p>"This little progress I've made is nothing. I haven't congratulated Senior Brother Mu for breaking through to middle Foundation Establishment! Daoist Friend Yun Qiong is also about to break through. Junior Brother is extremely envious!"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and said in a flattering tone.</p><p>When we parted ways at Gubei Town over twenty years ago, I wouldn’t have guessed that Mu Yifeng would have broken into the mid-level foundation-building stage. Yunqiong Exalted’s aura is also much stronger than before; it will only take coincidence to break through the bottleneck and enter the mid-level foundation-building stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had not expected to see them first when he returned to the Tianjing Secret. Suddenly, something occurred to him, and he asked in surprise, “Senior Martial Brother Mu, Daoist Fellow Yunqiong, what task have you been assigned? Are you accompanying Senior Cloud Wanderer?”</p><p>Since both of them were secret shadow guardians, him suddenly appearing in the Tianjing Secret must mean that Cloud Wanderer had received a message and come to the Tianjing Secret to rendezvous. Unless they had accepted the same mission, it would have been impossible for them to be there by chance.</p><p>“This must be Daoist Fellow Cloud Wanderer. I’ve been wanting to meet you for a long time!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng clasped his hands respectfully in greeting toward Cloud Wanderer. Unlike his warm greeting toward Qin Sang, he said politely, “It’s not only us, Junior Brother Qin will also be joining us.”</p><p>When Qin Sang heard this, he was momentarily stunned. Five years had passed; it was time for him to go on a mission. But he had yet to be notified, so he asked doubtfully, “Senior Brother Qi didn’t contact me about this matter……”</p><p>“I’m the one who asked Senior Brother Qi not to contact you,” Mu Yifeng chuckled, “This time, it will be a great accomplishment. To give you a surprise, Junior Brother Qin, do you remember Daoist Fellow Yin, the one who died in the mines twenty years ago……”</p><p>After hearing Mu Yifeng’s explanation, Qin Sang finally understood what was going on. A hint of joy appeared on his face.</p><p>It turned out that, twenty years ago, after they had reported the anomaly in the mine, the experts from Yuankong Town went to investigate the mine. They eventually discovered a devils’ lair in the same place where Yin Xingge had been killed.</p><p>The devils’ lair was a tunnel that connected to the mine vein. Yin Xingge had opened it up from above, exposing it.</p><p>There were countless devils’ corpses piled up inside for some reason, and there was even the corpse of a Nascent Soul cultivator at its deepest point. It had transformed into an extremely powerful humanoid cloud beast. Fortunately, the experts who had entered the mine were sufficiently cautious at the time, otherwise countless people would have been killed.</p><p>After cleaning up the devils’ lair, they realized that these humanoid cloud beast were most likely devils from ten thousand years ago, when the Demon Gate had been in control of Xuangguan Pass. As a result, devils had been active in the area.</p><p>In the end, they found a clue to a secret realm on the body of one of the Nascent Soul devils.</p><p>When the Demon Gate was driven out by the righteous path, they naturally did not give up the secret realms they had control of. As time passed, the Demon Gate never managed to retake Xuangguan Pass, and the people who had known about the existence of those secret realms gradually passed away. As a result, those secret realms were once again buried underground, with their treasures gathering dust, forgotten by all.</p>
