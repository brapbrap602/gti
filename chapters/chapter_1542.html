<h1>Chapter 1533: Phosphorescent Fungi (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1533: Phosphorescent Fungi (4k)</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Qin Sang darted into the cave, discovering its immense depth.</p><p>Judging from the traces, the cave wasn't formed by external forces. An internal explosion had destroyed the cave dwelling and the entire lake.</p><p>Over time, erosion had erased valuable information.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't determine if the force originated from the cave itself or if an intruder had caused the destruction.</p><p>What was certain was that it was no longer suitable as a dwelling.</p><p>"How time changes everything!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>The contents recorded by Senior Xiao Xiangzi on the jade slip were likely of little use.  Many similar sites were probably discovered and destroyed.</p><p>If Senior Xiao Xiangzi hadn't mentioned that only Nascent Soul cultivators could discover the secret of the Buddha bone relic, he wouldn't have dared to hold much hope.</p><p>Beneath the Sky Crack Valley, day and night were indistinguishable.</p><p>He did some quick calculations, realizing he had unknowingly searched Sky Crack Valley for over a month.</p><p>According to the cloud patterns in Sky Crack Valley, the valley opens only once every ten years, lasting from a couple of weeks to almost a month.</p><p>It was now the most dangerous period in Sky Crack Valley, with most cultivators having left.</p><p>Qin Sang, having found nothing, and with no further interest in exploring the secrets of Sky Crack Valley, prepared to return.</p><p>…</p><p>Within Sky Crack Valley.</p><p>A sheer cliff face was covered in thick vines, like giant pythons coiled around it. Though seemingly full of life, the gray color of the vines created an inexplicably eerie atmosphere.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Whispers of chilling wind snaked through the gaps between the vines, creating almost imperceptible whistling sounds.</p><p>Only the wind could be heard on the cliff, no animal or insect sounds, intensifying the unsettling feeling.</p><p>At that moment, two figures were hidden beneath the vines in a slightly wider crevice in the rock, carefully peering towards the top of the cliff.</p><p>A man and a woman, the woman only at the Foundation Establishment stage, her complexion sickly. The man, however, was a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Their cautiousness, their wariness, was all for a dark cave at the top of the cliff.</p><p>The cave was pitch black.</p><p>A foul stench emanated from the wind.</p><p>They lay motionless, having been there for over ten days, enduring the stench and avoiding using any techniques that might mask their presence, fearing they’d miss their opportunity.</p><p>The woman, accustomed to the stench, glanced at the man intently focused above, her eyes full of tenderness. Her lips moved slightly as she cautiously transmitted her voice, her tone laced with worry.</p><p>“Senior Brother, Sky Crack Valley is closing.”</p><p>“That information about the Serpent Shadow Flower’s blooming period was only approximate.  Bad luck for us; it didn't bloom when the valley opened.”</p><p>The man sighed. “If we miss this one, we don’t know how long we’ll have to wait.  My junior sister’s illness can’t wait. Refining this Serpent Shadow Flower will buy us some time, and I will search the heavens and earth to find the medicine to cure you. Master’s dying wish was for me to take care of you, how could I break my promise?  We have to get this one.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>The woman’s expression grew anxious, but the man interrupted.</p><p>“Junior Sister, have you forgotten how much I’ve improved?”</p><p>The man feigned nonchalance. “I’m a Golden Core cultivator now. Sky Crack Valley isn’t as dangerous as it used to be. Plus, before I came, I had someone specially craft a Yang Luo Umbrella for me; I can even withstand the common lightning storms in Sky Crack Valley…”</p><p>At that moment, a faint fragrance mingled with the stench.</p><p>The stench was overpowering, the fragrance subtle, easily overlooked.</p><p>The pair had waited days for this moment, instantly aware of the change, the man quickly swallowed the rest of his words, exclaiming with delight, “I’ll go and lure away the hawk demon.  Remember, junior sister, in an hour’s time, the Serpent Shadow Flower will be fully bloomed, its medicinal power at its peak.  Remember to refine it directly with your technique; don’t pick it!”</p><p>He’d given this advice countless times, yet still worried.</p><p>The woman felt comforted, gazing at his determined face, softly pleading, “I’m already gravely ill. If it’s impossible, Senior Brother, please don’t…”</p><p>“Don’t say such foolish things!”</p><p>The man abruptly stopped her, and without another word, dashed forward, his sword flashing as he plunged it into the cave.</p><p>The next moment, an enraged screech echoed from the cave, shrill and piercing.</p><p>The sword flew back, its light dim.</p><p>A monstrous wind followed, a thick stench like poison gas, making one dizzy. The wind carried a beast, its body like an eagle, yet its neck long and serpentine.</p><p>A creature, bizarrely like a snake’s body embedded in an eagle’s, appeared.</p><p>Seeing how easily the snake-eagle was provoked, the man was secretly pleased. Unafraid, he engaged the creature.</p><p>Unfortunately, the man had only recently achieved his current level of cultivation and lacked any powerful artifacts. Facing a snake-eagle at a higher cultivation stage, he was quickly at a disadvantage.</p><p>The woman remained hidden in a crevice, her face tense.</p><p>Black demonic winds filled the air, obscuring the sky, making the battle invisible.  She knew her senior brother was doing his best to distract the snake-eagle, buying her time.</p><p>As time passed, the scent of the Snake Shadow Flower intensified, nearing its bloom.  Unable to kill the man, the snake-eagle's cries grew sharper. Attracted by the flower's fragrance, it began to move toward its lair.</p><p>The man, however, launched a furious counterattack, ignoring his wounds, desperately holding the snake-eagle back.</p><p>Tears welled in the woman's eyes.  She bit her lip, avoiding looking up, and quickly slipped into the cave.</p><p>At this critical moment, the snake-eagle did something shocking.  Engaged in battle, it suddenly froze, seemingly petrified, leaving itself vulnerable to a blow from the man that severed a wing.  The snake-eagle awoke with a harsh screech—but this cry, unlike before, was filled not only with pain but with terror, as if it had encountered a natural enemy.</p><p>Even the man could sense the creature's fear.</p><p>Then, abandoning its lair and the precious herb, the snake-eagle fled in panic, its escape clumsy and uncontrolled.</p><p>Seeing the snake-eagle retreat, the man ceased his pursuit.  But the strange events left him deeply unsettled, a strong sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>What could have caused such terror in the snake-eagle?</p><p>Suppressing his shock, the man rushed to the cave entrance. He saw his junior sister diligently refining the Snake Shadow Flower. Turning, he looked around in confusion.</p><p>Then he witnessed a horrifying sight, a chilling wave of cold that froze his blood.</p><p>Deep within the Sky Crack Valley, stone peaks rose in profusion. On the horizon, the clouds were tinged yellow, upon closer inspection, revealed to be a vast, fiery yellow cloud.  This cloud, like a consuming fire, spread rapidly toward them, driving before it a huge flock of birds.</p><p>The yellow cloud was what had driven away the snake-eagle.</p><p>“Senior brother, you drove away the snake-eagle?”</p><p>The woman, having refined the Snake Shadow Flower and waiting to safely absorb its power, emerged from the cave. Seeing the snake-eagle gone, she was surprised.</p><p>Before she finished speaking, she noticed her senior brother’s unusual expression.  Following his gaze, she saw the rapidly approaching yellow cloud.  Trembling, a look of utter terror spread across her face, and she whispered in despair, “Ghostfire Worm Cloud!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The man grabbed his sister's arm, intending to flee, but felt a sharp pain as she broke free.</p><p>“Junior Sister…”</p><p>Turning back in shock, he saw her distance herself, tears streaming down her face, yet a resolute look in her eyes as she shook her head repeatedly.  Together, they would surely die. He might have a chance alone.</p><p>Their long search for a cure, their newly found hope, was instantly shattered.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange voice interrupted them.</p><p>“Unexpected to find such a devoted couple.  A rather fitting pair.”</p><p>Startled, they turned to see a figure materializing at the cave entrance, calm and still.  If not for the voice, they would have remained unaware of its presence.</p><p>Normally, they would have felt fear and apprehension.  Now, the man’s eyes held a spark of hope.</p><p>“Is this a worm cloud?”</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang, preparing to leave the valley.</p><p>“Respected senior, this yellow cloud is indeed a worm cloud,” the man replied, ignoring his sister's urging, bowing deeply.  “Within the cloud are terrifying insects called ghost worms. They spew poisonous mist, like fire and cloud, one of the three most terrifying plagues of Sky Crack Valley: the Ghostfire Worm Cloud. There is only one thing to do when facing it: flee.”</p><p>If overtaken by the Ghostfire Worm Cloud, the only chance of survival is to feign death using a Tortoise Breath Pill and then use a Fire Smoke Pill to counteract the poison.  But the price of these pills…"</p><p>The man spoke rapidly, his expression turning helpless at the end.  Established Golden Core cultivators could afford these two pills, but he had just achieved Golden Core and spent almost all his assets on information about the Serpent Shadow Flower.</p><p>"Ghost Worms?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>As he expected, the languages of Central State and North Sea shared a common origin.  The differences resulting from this evolution were easily adaptable for cultivators with exceptional memories, especially with the specialized Wisdom-enhancing Incantation.  Important texts in the cultivation world, as well as ancient texts unearthed in both regions, were largely consistent.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s knowledge, several types of spirit insects could create similar insect clouds, but not "Ghost Worms".  He realized this must be a local name.</p><p>The Sky-eye Butterfly could see through the worm cloud, but these were merely poisonous clouds exhaled by the ghost worms. The poisonous clouds expanded rapidly, with a massive army of ghost worms following behind.</p><p>Unlike a locust swarm that devoured all vegetation and creatures, the poisonous cloud's devastation was even greater.  Where the cloud passed, plants withered and life completely vanished. Countless birds and beasts fled in terror, only to be inevitably consumed by the poisonous cloud, instantly having their blood drained, leaving behind only shriveled corpses.</p><p>The poisonous cloud was like a gigantic monster, wantonly devouring life, turning everything it touched into a wasteland.  However, the Sky-裂谷 was no ordinary place; its vitality would recover within half a year.</p><p>Finally, the Sky-eye Butterfly found the ghost worms within the poisonous cloud.</p><p>"It’s Corrupt Phosphorus Fireflies!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>These spirit insects had limited combat strength and weren't suitable for use as gu insects.  Small numbers were ineffective, while large numbers would be an immense burden on a cultivator, making it a losing proposition.  However, when the Corrupt Phosphorus Firefly population reached a certain size, their poisonous cloud underwent a transformation, becoming a threat that even high-level cultivators would avoid. The larger the swarm, the more terrifying it became.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang silent, the man grew increasingly anxious, opening his mouth to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through his thoughts and smiled, "I'm afraid we can't escape."</p><p>The man was startled. He darted out of the stone cave, looked behind, and truly understood despair.  Behind them, another cloud of insects appeared; the two clouds were closing in on them, making escape impossible.</p><p>At this moment, ignoring the couple, Qin Sang deployed several array flags, setting up an array within the stone cave to isolate their aura, and simultaneously called for Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>After consuming the poisonous sacs of the frogs and fish, Fatty Silkworm had been sleeping soundly.  Qin Sang had worried about its tribulation in the storm belt, but it still showed no signs of breaking through.</p><p>The spirit array was quickly set up. The flags were shrouded in faint shadows as Qin Sang dashed inside, his figure instantly vanishing. Fatty Silkworm was awakened and reluctantly spat out an aura of poison-dispelling light, merging it with the shadows.</p><p>"Come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice, like a divine blessing, reached the ears of the two.  The initially despairing pair were overjoyed and cautiously entered the formation, their manner restrained.</p><p>"Junior Zhou Jin, and this is my junior sister, Ruan Yu. We are eternally grateful for your life-saving grace, Senior. We are forever indebted to you."</p><p>Even before the poisonous cloud arrived, he was convinced Qin Sang could help them survive.</p><p>Qin Sang cast a spell to conjure a stone wall, blocking the entrance. He glanced at Ruan Yu and said, amid their anxious expressions, "Golden Core cultivators…somewhat useful. Since you wish to repay me, do one thing for me."</p><p>Zhou Jin gritted his teeth, "Senior, please tell us.  We will do our utmost to repay you."</p><p>"No need to force yourselves."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "癸水精煞 has invaded your heart…no, it has merged with the煞气.  It seems the煞气 entered your body before birth, leaving behind a root cause. This led to a fortunate alteration of your constitution, allowing you to successfully build your foundation, but you won't live for much longer. That spirit herb only delays the onset of the symptoms; death is inevitable."</p><p>Qin Sang's words were cold and cruel.</p><p>However, the two were not alarmed but delighted, immediately kneeling down, "Senior, save us!"</p><p>"I do have a pill recipe that can suppress the煞气, but there's only a 30% chance of eliminating the root cause.  It's not difficult to refine. I can give you the recipe on the condition that you do something for me."</p><p>Qin Sang turned his attention to outside the stone cave.</p><p>The worm cloud had arrived. The poisonous cloud could penetrate the stone, invading and devouring life, but it was firmly blocked by Fatty Silkworm's poison-dispelling shield.</p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu exchanged glances.  They weren't sure whether this senior was trustworthy, but he was their only lifeline.  Qin Sang’s lack of exaggeration about the medicine's efficacy subtly increased their trust.</p><p>Ruan Yu tightly grasped Zhou Jin's hand, filled with worry.</p><p>But Zhou Jin no longer hesitated, "We will follow your instructions, Senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang produced a blank jade slip, "With your cultivation, you are qualified to leave the Northern Wilderness and travel. Go to the Nineteen States of Smoky Rain and gather some information for me. Place names might have changed; figure out a way to verify them…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Qin Sang paused, uttering a soft "Hm?".</p><p>Fatty Silkworm, lazily lying in his palm, inexplicably became agitated, rolling over, wagging its head and tail, urging Qin Sang to leave the stone cave. Something outside seemed to be attracting it.</p>
