<h1>Chapter 2105: Mirage Jade</h1><p>The two sat down at the stone table in front of the cave dwelling. The rustling bamboo leaves created a relaxed atmosphere, but both knew the situation had reached its most critical point.</p><p>“Only after sending the chosen disciples from each sect to the refuge can we truly fight without restraint,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>It was still unclear what the Zhuyan Tribe’s attitude towards outsiders was. Min Zhuo’s previous display of confidence, without any worry that they would report the matter to the Zhuyan Tribe, deepened Qin Sang’s suspicion.</p><p>He had to prepare for the worst.  Qin Sang even considered whether to merely feign strength on the surface, not actively contacting the Zhuyan Tribe, but silently constructing the Thunder Altar and waiting for them to approach.</p><p>Perhaps he could stall until the Thunder Altar was complete.</p><p>However, doing so meant abandoning the initiative. If Min Zhuo embellished the truth and twisted the facts before the Zhuyan Tribe, prejudicing them, the situation would be even more unfavorable.</p><p>After all, even if the Thunder Altar was completed, it could only protect the Storm Realm, not actively strike out and annihilate all enemies. If the Zhuyan Tribe harbored hostility towards them, ordering the various Imperial Clans to besiege them and carry out endless harassment, forcing them to constantly react, that was not a scenario Qin Sang wanted to see.</p><p>After careful consideration, it was best to act swiftly. If the Storm Realm wanted to establish itself in the Mist Sea, it had to do so openly and honestly.</p><p>“This time, let Su Nu remain here. Fellow Daoist and I will escort the disciples. On our return journey, we will visit the Zhuyan Tribe. That Yuan Miao is straightforward. We also have his token, so we might as well contact him first,” Qin Sang paused, then continued, “Just in case, Fellow Daoist might consider sending a Companion Beast first, without personally venturing into danger.”</p><p>“Thank you, Brother Qin, for your concern. However, in my opinion, given the Zhuyan Tribe's nature, it's best I go myself to show sincerity. Even if the Zhuyan Tribe has ulterior motives towards us, they will be upfront about it and wouldn't stoop to harming me at this juncture.”</p><p>Si Lu said with certainty.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Zhuyan Tribe's reputation preceded them, and indeed, Si Lu's words held some truth.</p><p>In fact, Si Lu had his own considerations. After witnessing Qin Sang's strength, he had always wanted to form an alliance with him, asking Qin Sang to help him return to the Siyou Tribe for revenge, even seeing Qin Sang as his greatest hope.</p><p>The sooner he could return to fight, the better.  Further delay, allowing the enemy to completely consolidate control, meant his chances of turning the tables were slim unless he could advance to the Saint Realm.</p><p>However, Si Lu couldn't offer anything that could truly persuade Qin Sang. This was the best opportunity.</p><p>How could he demonstrate his value if he was afraid of death?</p><p>Before Qin Sang, Si Lu never deliberately concealed his thoughts, nor did he need to.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this well but pretended to be unaware. Only today did he take the initiative to inquire about Si Lu’s grievances and vendettas.</p><p>"This is a serious matter. Although it pertains to Fellow Daoist's privacy, I must venture to ask, does Fellow Daoist hail from the Imperial Family or a Royal Clan lineage?"</p><p>A flicker of joy flashed in Si Lu’s eyes; Qin Sang had finally relented. “Brother Qin, having previously been in the Siyou Tribe's territory, you should have heard something. The Siyou Tribe follows a structure of One Emperor and Many Kings. However, there are differences in power amongst the Kings, with the Four Great Royal Clans holding the highest prestige. I come from the Yanshan Si Clan, one of the Four Great Royal Clans. My father was the previous Yan King!”</p><p>"The Siyou Imperial Clan also seems to bear the surname Si?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>When he passed through the Siyou Tribe's territory before, he had made some inquiries.  Combined with the fact that Si Lu had a high-level guard like Attendant Xia, he suspected that Si Lu might have come from the Siyou Imperial Clan.</p><p>Power struggles within the Imperial Clan were bound to be life-or-death affairs; this principle held true everywhere, and the Exotic Tribes were no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't yet have the ability to interfere in the internal strife of the Siyou Imperial Clan, so he had been avoiding probing into Si Lu’s secrets.</p><p>Si Lu nodded and explained, “The Si surname of the Siyou Tribe is divided into many branches, large and small, too numerous to count. Therefore, the name of the territory is always added before the surname to distinguish them. For example, our Yanshan Si Clan, while the Imperial Clan was originally known as the Xinghu Si Clan.</p><p>"It’s said that in ancient times, all Si Clans originated from the same branch.  There are even legends that the Siyou Tribe originated from the first Patriarch of the Si Clan.</p><p>"However, too much time has passed. A single Siyou Tribe member can establish a branch, and after generations of inheritance, the blood ties between the Si Clans are extremely thin. The sentiment of belonging to the same clan is long gone.  Mutual hostility and irreconcilable differences are not uncommon.</p><p>“Besides the Imperial Clan, another Great Royal Clan originally also bore the Si surname, but later changed it to the Si surname for unknown reasons."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, so that's how it was. The information he hastily gathered indeed contained many inaccuracies.</p><p>"Who are your enemies?"</p><p>A look of resentment appeared on Si Lu’s face. He said hatefully, "The Hanjiang Lu Clan, one of the Four Great Royal Clans!"</p><p>Not the Imperial Clan!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, but he didn't relax at all. Si Lu, coming from one of the Four Great Royal Clans, his father the former Yan King, and having a guard with strength comparable to late-stage Void Refinement, had fallen to such a state.  The enemy’s strength was evident.</p><p>Since the Hanjiang Lu Clan and the Yanshan Si Clan were equally renowned, why could the Si Clan be annihilated by them?  Could there be other forces supporting them behind the scenes, such as the Imperial Clan?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang asked, "The One Emperor and Four Kings, what is their strength?"</p><p>"The reason the Siyou Tribe can maintain this structure is because the Imperial Clan’s strength cannot completely overpower the Kings. They need the Four Great Royal Clans to check and balance each other to maintain their position. When my father was alive, among the Four Great Royal Clans, our Yanshan Si Clan and the Hanjiang Lu Clan were the strongest.</p><p>“However, the most formidable figure in the Hanjiang Lu Clan is not the Lu King, but the Grand Offering of the Lu Clan!</p><p>“When my father was young, during his travels, he befriended Attendant Xia and showed him kindness.  Later, Attendant Xia, to repay this kindness, willingly stayed by my father's side as an attendant.</p><p>“That Grand Offering of the Lu Clan isn't originally from the Lu Clan, but holds an extremely high position within the clan.  It is said that the Lu King always treats him with the respect due to a teacher. He is the true strongest of the Lu Clan. Attendant Xia himself admitted that he was no match for this person.”</p><p>Si Lu didn't know much about the Grand Offering of the Lu Clan. Back then, he wasn't even qualified to stand before the Grand Offering, so he could only relay all the information he knew.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang became even more puzzled. The Lu Clan had their Grand Offering, and the Si Clan had Attendant Xia.  Their strength wasn’t significantly weaker, so why were they defeated so thoroughly?</p><p>He frowned and asked, "Did the Siyou Imperial Clan simply stand by and watch the Yanshan Si Clan be destroyed?"</p><p>"The Lu Clan's success was due to two factors. Firstly, my father's death created an opportunity they exploited. Secondly, there were other hidden circumstances…</p><p>"On the day of my father's funeral, experts from the Yanshan Si Clan came to pay their respects. That night, some of them were poisoned.  The poison was incredibly potent and bizarre. Even with Attendant Xia’s cultivation, he couldn't purge the toxin and could only suppress it forcibly with a secret technique at great cost.</p><p>"As the poison took hold, an alarm was raised outside.  Experts from the Lu Clan had somehow infiltrated and were lying in wait. In the ensuing chaos, the Lu Clan stormed the manor.</p><p>“At that critical moment, seeing the battle was lost, Attendant Xia could only break through the siege with me.  Many of my father’s guards sacrificed themselves to cover our escape. We didn't shake off our pursuers until we shifted to Kanzhou. However, that poison was too terrifying…”</p><p>A trace of fear appeared in Si Lu’s eyes. “After we reached safety, Attendant Xia intended to heal his injuries first. Unexpectedly, as time passed, the secret technique could no longer completely seal the poison. Any further delay might have been fatal.  Left with no choice, we had to seek a cure, but we were discovered by members of the Water Tribe.  During our escape, Attendant Xia grew weaker and weaker, ultimately sacrificing himself to buy me a chance at survival.”</p><p>Recalling the events of that time, Si Lu’s face was filled with grief, and the hatred in his heart deepened.</p><p>Qin Sang was also incredibly astonished upon hearing this.</p><p>What kind of poison could even a late-stage Void Refinement expert be unable to suppress, leading to such a tragic end?</p><p>If the enemy still possessed this poison, could he, having lost his Poison Pearl, resist it?</p><p>“Attendant Xia once said that it should be a unique poison specifically targeting our Siyou Tribe, specifically attacking our brow’s Spiritual Aperture, causing the spiritual energy within to constantly decline. Each time Attendant Xia used the Mutual Shift Technique or overdrew the power of a Companion Beast, he would lose that Companion Beast, as if it were devoured by the poison, never to be recovered.  Despite his best efforts, Attendant Xia could only barely prevent the poison from continuing to devour, and the surviving Companion Beasts were already greatly weakened.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s furrowed brow, Si Lu further explained, “In the records of our Siyou Tribe, several similar poisons are documented. They are deadly to us but might be ordinary substances, even superior spiritual medicines, to others.</p><p>“These poisons have long since vanished from the world. I don’t know where the Lu Clan obtained them, but they certainly couldn't have acquired much.</p><p>“These poisons have different properties, and administering them is not easy. We suspect it was Cloud Heaven Primordial Liquid.  This substance is colorless and odorless, only taking effect when ingested.  Dissolved in water, it’s undetectable, difficult even to perceive. If the Lu Clan had planned this beforehand, sending someone to add it to the spiritual wine during the manor’s night banquet would have been entirely feasible.”</p><p>"I hope so."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. If the poisoning method was indeed like that, with prior warning, they only needed to be cautious and shouldn't have to worry.</p><p>However, the safest course of action was to prepare an antidote in advance.</p><p>Si Lu sighed, "Attendant Xia did manage to understand some of the poison's properties, but he hadn't had time to comprehend a method of detoxification, leaving behind only some general ideas. Unless we consult a Master Alchemist and they are willing to devote their efforts to this."</p><p>The Siyou Tribe had Master Alchemists, but Si Lu dared not contact them.</p><p>It seemed he could only be careful himself.</p><p>However, for cultivators outside the Siyou Tribe, Cloud Heaven Primordial Liquid was not a deadly poison.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "The Hanjiang Lu Clan annexed your Yanshan Si Clan. What was the reaction of the Imperial Clan and the other Kings?"</p><p>“Neither Ji Hong nor I have been able to glean any subsequent developments. The Lu Clan’s actions couldn't have escaped the notice of the Imperial Clan and the other Kings.  They likely didn't want to cause widespread unrest within the tribe and jointly suppressed the news.  But the lack of open conflict suggests that the Yanshan Si Clan wasn’t completely slaughtered. Otherwise, everyone would be in fear, and the Imperial Clan wouldn’t be able to maintain control.  Some of my father's former subordinates should have survived. Perhaps the Lu Clan and the Imperial Clan reached some sort of agreement…"</p><p>Over the years, Si Lu had constantly considered various possibilities and how he could exact his revenge.</p><p>Now, the Lu Clan was powerful.  With Yan King and Attendant Xia dead, the Yanshan Si Clan was scattered.  The former Yan King’s subordinates might not be willing to step forward and support him.</p><p>Times changed, and people's perspectives shifted.</p><p>"In that case, the Lu Clan defied the world and attacked you, yet couldn't fully annex your clan. What was their purpose? Was it simply territorial expansion, or was there a blood feud between your two clans?"</p><p>Qin Sang needed to understand the Hanjiang Lu Clan's motives to determine their resolve to eliminate all threats.</p><p>Once Si Lu's whereabouts were leaked, how many experts would they send?</p><p>Regarding this, Si Lu didn't conceal anything.  “That's only part of it.  They also certainly wanted to seize the Mirage Jade in my possession!”</p><p>Saying this, Si Lu retrieved an object from his sleeve. It was two pieces of jade combined, forming a ring about the size of a thumb.</p><p>Strangely, half of the ring was genuine jade, while the other half appeared hazy and illusory, like a jade shadow.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>Seeing Si Lu’s unreserved manner as he handed it over, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before reaching out to take it and examine it carefully.</p><p>This jade seemed half real and half existing in the void. Apart from that, Qin Sang didn't sense anything extraordinary. It clearly wasn't a Spiritual Treasure, let alone a True Treasure.</p><p>“Brother Qin, you know that our Exotic Tribes have Sacred Grounds where experts above the Saint Realm cultivate.  You probably don't know that the Sacred Grounds have another important function.</p><p>"Within, lie opportunities left by the ancestors of each tribe. They open periodically, and those within each tribe nearing a breakthrough to the Saint Realm will wait until that time to enter the Sacred Grounds.  It is said that breakthroughs are easier there than outside.</p><p>"In addition, each tribe can also send a select few into the Sacred Grounds during this time. With good fortune, they might obtain ancestral opportunities.</p><p>“However, opportunity comes with danger. These opportunities must be fought for.  The Sacred Grounds are the largest battlefield between the Heaven Tribe and the Water Tribe.  Even within each tribe, internal struggles and fights occur, with countless casualties.  But those who safely emerge from the Sacred Grounds see their strength greatly enhanced.</p><p>"There are two requirements to enter the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>“Firstly, the Sacred Grounds open during the Yuánjiāo Sea Market. One must be qualified to enter the Yuánjiāo Sea Market, meaning they must have Void Realm Second Stage cultivation.  Weaker, smaller tribes aren't eligible to participate.  But once a tribe has a Void Realm Second Stage expert, they can enter the Sacred Grounds and perhaps soar to great heights from then on.</p><p>“Secondly, a token is required, which is this Mirage Token.”</p><p>“Within each tribe, the circumstances differ, and the method of allocating Mirage Tokens varies. The Siyou Tribe's Mirage Tokens are controlled by the Imperial Clan and the Four Great Royal Clans."</p><p>Qin Sang toyed with the Mirage Token in his hand.  So there was such a secret behind it.</p><p>He wondered what the Exotic Tribes' Sacred Grounds were like, perhaps a Cave Heaven.</p><p>Since Saint Realm and Ancestral Realm experts could cultivate within, it was certainly no ordinary Minor Thousand World.</p><p>The struggle within the Sacred Grounds also reflected the painstaking efforts of the Exotic Tribes' ancestors. Confined to the Mist Sea, without external threats, the Exotic Tribes would lose their vigilance and fighting spirit over time.</p><p>Of course, none of this had anything to do with Qin Sang.</p><p>The Exotic Tribes wouldn't allow an outsider like him into the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the Mirage Jade to Si Lu.</p><p>Si Lu hesitated for a moment before saying, "A single Mirage Token allows its owner to bring a helper into the Sacred Grounds.  I'm not familiar with the Sacred Grounds and am unsure whether outsiders are permitted. If there is precedent, I’m willing to go with Brother Qin.”</p><p>He had considered all possibilities, and this might be the only thing he possessed that could move Qin Sang. (End of Chapter)</p>
