<h1>Chapter 1424: Strange Stone Statues in the Buddhist Temple</h1><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, collecting the most valuable herbs and placing them in a jade box.</p><p>Among them were the prized Spirit Lantern Flowers, and another herb that could help Tan Hao break through his cultivation bottleneck.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A sudden bell tolled.</p><p>The sound, resonant and melodious, echoed throughout the entire Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, listening intently.</p><p>The bell had a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>Protected by the jade Buddha that guarded his primordial spirit, Qin Sang felt nothing unusual. He looked at Tan Hao.</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes were half-closed, his expression calm. The anxiety he had shown earlier, when Qin Sang mentioned his plan to compete with powerful cultivators for a treasure, had subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed. He focused, trying to pinpoint the source of the bell, but couldn't find it.</p><p>"Is it a treasure, or something else?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Such an item, capable of purifying the mind, would be beneficial to cultivators. If he could move it, even if he had no use for it himself, he could take it back to Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>Tan Hao shook his head, a hint of regret in his voice. "The sound of the morning and evening bells doesn't come from a treasure; otherwise, I wouldn't be stuck here. It seems to originate from a strange restriction.  But the senior cultivator didn't say whether it's a Jing Hai Sect technique, or part of the original demon-suppressing seal."</p><p>"The cultivation world is truly full of wonders."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, feeling enlightened.</p><p>He put away the herb Tan Hao needed, tossed the jade box to Tan Hao, stood up, and looked at the pitted and pockmarked herb garden. "It's almost time. They've started breaking the seal; we should prepare as well."</p><p>As he spoke, a dark shadow darted in.</p><p>Tan Hao was startled by the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, but seeing the puppet standing respectfully behind Qin Sang, he gained a greater appreciation for his strength.</p><p>"Such a pity…"</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at the remaining herbs.</p><p>These herbs were also incredibly valuable, rare even in his estimation.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Sacrifice leads to gain. Deception and reality interwoven will fool their eyes. Wait here for my signal. When the time is right, destroy the garden's restriction, revealing the herbs hidden in the mist. Then activate your Raincloud Kettle to create illusions of these herbs, blending them among the real ones."</p><p>Qin Sang handed Tan Hao a jade slip, instructing him to study it carefully and memorize every detail, so the illusions could be convincingly realistic.</p><p>Guided by Gui Mu, Tan Hao, with his understanding of Buddhist restrictions and thorough preparation, could create chaos in the herb garden.</p><p>The Raincloud Kettle was a top-grade treasure, originally owned by a Yuan Ying cultivator in the Boundless Sea.  The cultivator had provoked Gui Mu, been killed, and the kettle had been taken by Gui Mu and later given to Tan Hao.</p><p>During his time with Gui Mu, Tan Hao had received many benefits.</p><p>This treasure was an artifact of illusionary magic. The spout emitted mist, creating illusions that were nearly indistinguishable from reality.</p><p>Having this treasure saved Qin Sang a lot of trouble.</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, taking out the Raincloud Kettle.  It was a stone kettle, no bigger than a palm, its surface engraved with swirling dark clouds. Vapor constantly condensed at the spout, gently rippling.</p><p>"Although it's a top-grade treasure, my cultivation is too weak. I'm afraid they'll easily see through it," Tan Hao said worriedly.</p><p>"The purple flames of the void will interfere with their vision and judgment. Besides, all I need is to distract them for a moment—that's enough time for me to do what I need to do."</p><p>Qin Sang reassured him.</p><p>His plan was to use the strange phenomena in the herb garden to draw the attention of the Hun Mo Elder, allowing him to seize the treasure and escape through a secret passage.  However, how to shake off the Hun Mo Elder and his pursuers after obtaining the treasure still needed careful consideration.</p><p>Tan Hao took a deep breath and said solemnly, "Qin Xiong, be careful!"</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't risk my life. I'll only act if I'm certain of success. If things go wrong, we'll just divide the herbs and leave," Qin Sang said with a calm smile, turning towards the secret passage.</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet followed closely behind.</p><p>Tan Hao held the Raincloud Kettle in one hand and a talismans in the other, his nerves taut.</p><p>Entering the secret passage, Qin Sang headed towards the path leading to the golden peak.</p><p>After a short while, Qin Sang paused, his expression turning serious as he looked ahead.</p><p>The familiar intertwined red and gold light filled the passage.</p><p>He recalled the layout of Jing Hai Sect. The passage bypassed the mountain pass and led to the golden peak. Qin Sang realized he was at the edge of that mountain pass.</p><p>The walls of the passage were part of the seal.</p><p>Up close, the scene was different from the ‘卍’ seal outside.</p><p>The passage walls glowed a bright red, the fiery energy within seeming on the verge of bursting forth.  The power of the seal manifested on the surface of the walls.</p><p>Clearly visible were two layers to the seal.</p><p>Countless tiny "d" characters flowed on the outermost layer, a Buddhist restriction.</p><p>Inside that, was a restriction unlike any Qin Sang had ever seen—mysterious and complex.  He stared for a while, attempting to understand it, only to feel a splitting headache.</p><p>“It must be the work of an ancient master.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, ceasing his efforts.</p><p>He then noticed fissures in the inner seal, and that the majority of the Buddhist restriction was focused on suppressing these areas.</p><p>Recalling Tan Hao’s mention of the awakening demon, Qin Sang nodded slightly, guessing at the events of that time.</p><p>He studied the seals on the wall for a moment before proceeding.</p><p>Soon, he reached the end of the passage, where a tightly sealed stone door blocked his path.  Buddhist light shimmered on its surface.</p><p>The entire Golden Summit Hall was sealed by powerful restrictions, the passage being no exception.  </p><p>Though unable to see inside the hall, Qin Sang had a complete mental image thanks to Tan Hao’s description, and knew the exact location of the artifacts.</p><p>He first recalled Tan Hao’s explanation of the Golden Summit Hall’s restrictions, then gently touched the stone door.  After that, he made no further movement.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Golden Summit Hall.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren and Yu Yi Yuan Jun landed on the golden brick pavement.</p><p>The hall shone brilliantly, boasting seven doors, three of which were ajar but inaccessible. A golden Buddhist restriction enveloped the entire structure.</p><p>Through the cracks in the doors, the interior was visible.</p><p>It was a Buddhist temple.</p><p>At the back of the hall stood a majestic golden Buddha statue.  As non-Buddhists, they couldn't identify which Buddha it represented. Two arhat statues flanked the main image.</p><p>Strangely, another statue stood beside the Buddha.</p><p>This figure stood with hands behind its back, possessing striking brows and eyes.  Clad in flowing robes, it stood on a square stone, at the same height as the Buddha, suggesting a status equal to the Buddha himself.</p><p>Upon seeing these statues, doubt clouded Yu Yi Yuan Jun's eyes.</p><p>This was highly unusual. The Buddhist order was strict.  Why would the Jing Hai Sect enshrine a non-Buddhist figure in its main hall? A lay devotee, perhaps?</p><p>Yu Yi Yuan Jun stared intently.  Even as a mere statue, the figure emanated an extraordinary aura, far from ordinary.</p><p>She searched her memory, recalling influential figures throughout the history of the Three Realms of Bei Hai, but found no match.</p><p>Lost in thought, Yu Yi Yuan Jun failed to notice the glint of cunning in Hun Mo Lao Ren's cloudy eyes.</p>
