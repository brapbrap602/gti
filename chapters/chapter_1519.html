<h1>Chapter 1510: Deadly Trap (4k)</h1><p>Outside was a boundless expanse of white, misty clouds.</p><p>The next layer was a rapidly expanding sea of fire.</p><p>The sea of fire was a riot of colors, yet the roaring of the fiery energy waves gradually weakened, paling in comparison to the radiant, multi-hued Exquisite Pagoda hovering in mid-air.</p><p>Further inward, crimson flowing flames were just beginning to erupt.</p><p>And huddled in a corner was a cluster of black spirit flames.</p><p>Everyone felt as if they had entered a realm of spirit flames, yet the spectacle before them was so beautiful it seemed unreal. And within this beauty, a danger lurked that sent shivers down everyone's spine!</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The Southern Brightfire, like a newly born red sun, dyed a swathe of the void crimson, devouring everything in its path.</p><p>The Illusory Realm of Mountains and Rivers and the hundred-*zhang* phantom were obliterated by the crimson flames.</p><p>In the next instant, a streak of black light was carried out by the impact of the Southern Brightfire, sent flying.</p><p>Within the black light, it was clear to see, was the Fiend Fusion Token.</p><p>The Fiend Fusion Token tumbled end over end, its precious light dimmed to the extreme. It was as if it had been struck by an immense force, its speed even faster than before.</p><p>Before anyone could clearly see if the token itself was damaged, with a *whoosh*, it disappeared into the depths of the clouds.</p><p>At the same time, those with sharp eyes noticed a faint white light flashing within the Southern Brightfire.</p><p>It had to be the Great Sage Heavenly Roc's Mountain and River Pearl!</p><p>Everyone was experienced by now, and they focused their attention on the Mountain and River Pearl, only to see the white light flash and disappear. The Mountain and River Pearl plummeted directly from mid-air, pale and dim, sinking into the depths of the void in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At the last moment, someone vaguely saw a crack appear in the center of the Mountain and River Pearl, almost splitting the entire bead.</p><p>This treasure had a unique function, but its body was not as hard as swords or armor. It was far inferior to the Fiend Fusion Token, and a direct collision with the Southern Brightfire left it with almost no chance of survival.</p><p>The treasures of two of the most powerful figures of the current age were instantly defeated.</p><p>At the edge of the sea of fire,</p><p>Bi Fang was stamping his feet and cursing furiously.</p><p>It had seen the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and instantly recognized Qin Sang's identity.</p><p>The past decade or so could be described as a string of bad luck.</p><p>Everything began when it, along with Sly Fox and Frog Fish, pursued Qin Sang for thousands of miles.</p><p>Since then,</p><p>the treasures coveted by all the demons had mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>Then, it had been chased by Qin Sang, and had to use a self-mutilating divine ability to escape. It had no choice but to abandon its overseas territory and return to the Demon Realm to recuperate. Then, inexplicably, disaster struck. Tong Lingyu came looking for trouble and, without a word, beat Sly Fox to death.</p><p>Bi Fang was once again seriously injured and fled, forced to seek refuge with the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, feeling extremely aggrieved.</p><p>Enemies meeting, their eyes burned with rage!</p><p>It hated Qin Sang and the Wind Master to the bone. Seeing Qin Sang daring to act so presumptuously in front of so many demons and devils, it believed its chance for revenge had come.</p><p>Its cultivation was inferior to the Great Sage Heavenly Roc and Elder Fiend Fusion, but its innate divine ability was specialized in fire manipulation. Facing the impact of the fiery energy waves, it had some means of coping, and it was not much later than the other two in regaining its footing. Without hesitation, it burned its essence blood, preparing to personally slay its enemy.</p><p>Bi Fang directly manifested its demon body, its demonic fire like blood, its aura truly formidable.</p><p>Then, it witnessed this astonishing scene.</p><p>"Uh!"</p><p>Bi Fang's eyes bulged, and it froze in mid-air, its curses stuck in its throat, as if someone had grabbed it by the neck.</p><p>The hatred in its eyes was replaced by terror.</p><p>A deep fear of the Southern Brightfire.</p><p>Among the demons and devils, there were a few others who relied on special divine abilities or treasures to resist the fiery energy waves and recover first.</p><p>They were all renowned experts, battle-hardened and quick to react. Before they had fully regained their footing, they activated their treasures, or manifested their demon bodies and unleashed divine abilities, following closely behind Fiend Fusion and Heavenly Roc in launching their attacks.</p><p>If Qin Sang hesitated even slightly, even if he was delayed for a moment by Fiend Fusion and the others.</p><p>Once all the demons and devils came to their senses, he would be surrounded and attacked. Becoming mincemeat would be a luxury. A concentrated barrage of attacks would vaporize any spirit treasure, leaving him erased from existence, sharing the same fate as Liuli.</p><p>The Divine Sun Tree unleashed its might, the Mountain and River Pearl cracked, and the Fiend Fusion Token's whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>This was intimidation!</p><p>The Moon Devil was as famous as the Featherclad Primordial Sovereign in the Boundless Sea, stylish and elegant, his appearance indistinguishable between male and female.</p><p>He had a crescent moon pattern at the center of his brow, hence the name Moon Devil. In truth, it was because his cultivation technique was special. His Intrinsic Treasure needed to constantly absorb moonlight, leaving a mark on his brow.</p><p>When the fiery energy waves struck, the crescent moon on the Moon Devil's brow flashed, spreading a clear radiance.</p><p>The clear radiance was like a transparent garment, blocking in front of the Moon Devil, rippling slightly, forming layers of waves. When the flames touched the clear radiance, a portion of them slid away, having a force-dissipating effect.</p><p>The Moon Devil retreated gracefully, his fingers twisting at his brow. The crescent moon separated from his body, transforming into a crescent scimitar, spinning rapidly, incomparably sharp, and slashing out fiercely.</p><p>Seeing the fate of the Fiend Fusion Token and the Mountain and River Pearl, the Moon Devil's face was filled with shock. He couldn't help but hesitate, and the crescent scimitar faltered.</p><p>There were still six firebirds on the Divine Sun Tree. Where the three had flown away, crimson fire circulated, rapidly condensing. Clearly, it was not just a one-time attack.</p><p>If they angered the opponent, and a few firebirds were thrown at them, who could withstand it?</p><p>Unlike the Mountain and River Pearl, this was his Intrinsic Treasure, closely related to his cultivation.</p><p>If his Intrinsic Treasure was destroyed, it would backlash against him. Serious injury would be the least of his worries. What chance would he have to seize the treasure then?</p><p>Whether the treasure in the Exquisite Pagoda fell into the hands of this mysterious person, or was seized by Fiend Fusion or Heavenly Roc, what difference would it make?</p><p>How could the Moon Devil willingly sow the seeds for others to reap the harvest?</p><p>The other devil lords all harbored similar thoughts, each with their own ulterior motives. The Demon Kings were a little more united than the devil cultivators, but they gathered at Heavenly Roc Mountain to feast, not to risk their lives.</p><p>In fact, Elder Fiend Fusion was indeed affected by the damage to the Fiend Fusion Token.</p><p>At the same time as the Divine Sunbird exploded.</p><p>Not far from the battlefield, a streak of blood light suddenly appeared, and ghost mist churned. Elder Fiend Fusion's figure gradually solidified, and he was about to step out.</p><p>He remembered Qin Sang's endless stream of methods and his Thunder Evasion Technique, and directly used the Shadow Shift divine ability to rapidly close the distance.</p><p>The consumption of ghost spirits by this divine ability was determined by the distance, and it was still bearable.</p><p>Even if the treasure couldn't kill Qin Sang, he could intercept him in time.</p><p>If he could kill him directly, that would be even better. He could snatch the Futu Pagoda before the Great Sage Heavenly Roc.</p><p>However, Elder Fiend Fusion never expected Qin Sang to have another trump card. The Fiend Fusion Token's defeat was so complete that it made his face pale and his body tremble.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>another anomaly occurred!</p><p>The Southern Brightfire's range of influence was vast, and its power would greatly diminish away from the core of the explosion, but the flames would not disappear for a while.</p><p>From within the crimson flames, a cluster of ghostly blue cold light suddenly burst out. It concealed a Kui Serpent!</p><p>One cold, one hot, forming a stark contrast.</p><p>The Kui Serpent bared its fangs and claws, exceptionally ferocious. The power of the spirit treasure that Liuli had forcibly suppressed was now completely unleashed, pouncing on Elder Fiend Fusion without a word.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Divine Sunbird to clear the way, firstly, to avoid being trapped and to resolve the battle quickly, and secondly, to use the aura of the Southern Brightfire to conceal the Four Multiplied Kui Serpent Seal.</p><p>When the Divine Sunbird attacked, its momentum could not be concealed at all.</p><p>Liuli, however, was different. She cultivated the *Treasure Control Secret Art*, and at least had some control over the Four Multiplied Kui Serpent Seal. The Divine Sunbird attracting attention was the best cover for the Four Multiplied Kui Serpent Seal.</p><p>Those demons and devils had their minds captivated by the Divine Sun Tree. How could they have imagined that they still had another spirit treasure?</p><p>This was the deadly trap Qin Sang had prepared for Elder Fiend Fusion!</p><p>He was counting on Elder Fiend Fusion's greed for the Futu Pagoda.</p><p>Of course, if Elder Fiend Fusion didn't take the bait, Qin Sang wouldn't lose out. With no one to stop him, he would directly enter the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes tightly, forgetting both herself and the outside world, her mind immersed in the spirit treasure, fully activating the *Treasure Control Secret Art*. Her hand seals changed continuously, directly executing the most powerful transformation that Yin Changsheng had used.</p><p>The Kui Serpent strode through the void, its fierce eyes locked onto Elder Fiend Fusion. The cold flames all over its body condensed in its mouth, and then its body also merged with the cold flames!</p><p>Executed by Liuli, it naturally couldn't compare to Yin Changsheng.</p><p>But its power was still beyond that of a mere treasure.</p><p>Another spirit treasure!</p><p>The faces of the demons and devils were filled with astonishment, their minds reeling in disbelief.</p><p>What was this guy's background?</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The cold flames were as fast as a shooting star.</p><p>Elder Fiend Fusion bore the brunt of the attack.</p><p>As the crisis approached, Elder Fiend Fusion's scalp tingled. He could even feel the aura of death.</p><p>His eldest disciple had not yet recovered from the impact of the fiery energy waves. Seeing this scene, he was immediately scared out of his wits and cried out in alarm.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>At this critical moment, Elder Fiend Fusion let out a long howl. The ghost mist around him was like boiling water. His physical body, which was about to fully solidify, was forcibly stopped.</p><p>Then, Elder Fiend Fusion reversed back into his ethereal form, and the ghost mist surged back, engulfing him.</p><p>At the edge of the sea of fire,</p><p>where Elder Fiend Fusion had originally stood, another cloud of ghost mist appeared. Before the ghost spirit could manifest, a sharp scream came from within the mist.</p><p>The scream was incredibly shrill, filled with despair and unwillingness.</p><p>The ghost spirit possessed intelligence and knew what Fiend Fusion intended to do.</p><p>However, the ghost spirit could do nothing, unable to resist Elder Fiend Fusion's will, and could only obediently act as a scapegoat.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The cold flames pierced through the ghost mist.</p><p>The ghost spirit's scream came to an abrupt end.</p><p>Elder Fiend Fusion's figure appeared at the edge of the sea of fire. His face was covered with dense black ghost patterns, extremely eerie.</p><p>At the moment the ghost spirit perished, the ghost patterns shattered!</p><p>Elder Fiend Fusion's face was pale and bloodless, and wrinkles crawled across his face at a visible speed. Not only did he look more like an old man, but there was almost no sign of life in his body.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly lamented his misfortune and pressed down on the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>He knew how difficult it was to deal with a Grand Master.</p><p>Liuli controlled the Four Multiplied Kui Serpent Seal, even with a calculated ambush, it would be difficult to completely kill Elder Fiend Fusion.</p><p>He had already prepared. After the Kui Serpent succeeded, he would use the Seven Calamities Soul-Slaying Formation, seizing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to slay this devil!</p><p>Both spirit treasures had already been exposed. In the future, Elder Fiend Fusion would be on guard, and there would never be such a good opportunity again.</p><p>To take Elder Fiend Fusion's head amidst an army of thousands, the thought alone was exhilarating.</p><p>It would also be a deterrent to the other demons and devils.</p><p>At that time, who in the three realms of the North Sea would dare to be presumptuous in front of him?</p><p>He didn't expect that such a deep scheme would fail to kill Elder Fiend Fusion. This devil's Shadow Shift divine ability could actually be reversed.</p><p>Fortunately, he had eliminated the ghost spirit, crippling one of Elder Fiend Fusion's arms. It was not a complete waste.</p><p>Judging by Elder Fiend Fusion's appearance, the ghost spirit was probably more than just his right-hand man. Suffering such a heavy blow, at least within the Sacred Ground, Elder Fiend Fusion was no longer a threat to him.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang burst into laughter.</p><p>The laughter reached Elder Fiend Fusion's ears, sounding no different from mockery, making him so angry that he almost coughed up blood.</p><p>The other demons and devils heard the laughter, their minds shaken, and they couldn't help but ask themselves, who was the real devil?</p><p>Amidst the loud laughter, Qin Sang's movements did not stop. His gaze shifted to another formidable enemy, and he saw a golden light rapidly approaching.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc had only performed a simple refinement of the Mountain and River Pearl, so the damage to the treasure had little effect on him.</p><p>Qin Sang also knew that although spirit treasures were powerful, two fists were no match for four hands.</p><p>The previous exchange had only taken place in the blink of an eye, but the other demons and devils were about to escape the fiery energy waves. He absolutely could not be entangled by the Great Sage Heavenly Roc.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang made a decisive decision. His incarnation consumed the remaining true essence, driving the three Divine Birds to fly towards the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, and then his main body took over the Divine Sun Tree.</p><p>By now, both his external incarnation and Liuli were nearing exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang was not worried about this.</p><p>Firstly, Elder Fiend Fusion was seriously injured, reducing one formidable enemy. As long as his main body could still control the Divine Sunbirds, those demons and devils would be wary.</p><p>Secondly, he had the Futu Pagoda and could enter the Exquisite Pagoda first, while the demons and devils had to break through the barrier first.</p><p>Thirdly, the appearance of the Exquisite Pagoda would definitely alarm Tong Lingyu and the others.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The Divine Birds, vivid and lifelike, spread their wings and flew over.</p><p>Facing these Divine Sunbirds, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc felt an inexplicable pressure, even an urge to prostrate himself in worship.</p><p>Seeing Elder Fiend Fusion's miserable state, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc's pupils constricted. He had no time to think, and let out a long cry, spitting out a ball of golden light from his mouth.</p><p>The unknown was the most terrifying.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc had dealt with Tong Lingyu and understood the Four Multiplied Kui Serpent Seal.</p><p>Although he didn't know why this spirit treasure had fallen into the hands of an unknown girl, he knew one thing: Liuli, at only the early Nascent Soul stage, could not sustain a prolonged expenditure.</p><p>As for the Divine Sun Tree, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, having been through countless battles, could also see some clues.</p><p>As long as he had witnessed it, he had a way to deal with it!</p><p>The golden light was a small, exquisite Golden Roc.</p><p>It was different from the Golden Roc that appeared at the entrance to the Sacred Ground. This Golden Roc did not resemble the Great Sage Heavenly Roc himself, but was very similar to the legendary Golden-Winged Great Peng, possessing a fraction of its divine aura!</p><p>The Golden Roc spread its wings and, with equally impressive speed, collided with the Divine Sunbird!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The golden light was blinding, gradually fading into the Southern Brightfire.</p><p>Layers of fire waves surged over.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc's gaze was calm. Hisé??light swiftly changed direction, and with exquisite evasion techniques, he dodged the impact of the Divine Sunbird, only losing a few feathers.</p><p>However, he also missed the last chance to stop Qin Sang, and could only stare at them with a gloomy gaze, separated by the boundless sea of fire.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved his incarnation, pulled Liuli, and flew towards the Exquisite Pagoda. Before leaving, he urged the Divine Sun Tree to cast a shadow in another direction, as if about to attack.</p><p>At the edge of the sea of fire, General Gui's expression changed.</p><p>A streak of black light leaped up from the ground, hastily fleeing. It was a puppet no different from an ordinary person.</p><p>General Gui didn't know how his puppet had been exposed, but he didn't dare to take the risk, watching helplessly as Qin Sang swaggered away.</p><p>There were no more obstacles ahead!</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's figures flashed repeatedly, passing through the layers of flames unharmed, and arrived beneath the Exquisite Pagoda. They touched the golden light barrier and easily passed through!</p><p>The demons and devils finally recovered, roaring in anger and launching a concentrated attack.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of these attacks were blocked by the flames. Even if some of them rushed into the flames, they encountered the golden light barrier and were like hitting a wall, blocked outside.</p><p>Under everyone's watchful eyes, the two figures, without looking back, entered the Exquisite Pagoda!</p>
