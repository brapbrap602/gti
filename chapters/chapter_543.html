<h1>Chapter 536: The Assault on the Spirit</h1><p>Wu Youdao didn't believe a word of Qin Sang's story, angrily shouting, "Sneaky rat! You not only trespassed our sect, but also dared to kill my disciple before me!  I will kill you today!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Would Daoist Wu surrender if it were you? Besides, Wen Yanjie and I had a long-standing feud; I just lacked the time to deal with him before.  If Daoist Wu investigates, you will know what kind of person he was.  I've done you a favor by cleaning up your sect, preventing future trouble and threats to Qingyang Sect."</p><p>"You dare make excuses!"</p><p>Wu Youdao was furious, yet secretly suspicious.</p><p>Qin Sang had accurately named Wen Yanjie, his tone seemingly genuine.</p><p>Had they really had prior dealings?</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator and a Foundation Establishment cultivator were worlds apart.  Unless Wen Yanjie was incredibly foolish and had done something terrible, why would a Golden Core cultivator notice him?</p><p>Despite his thoughts, Wu Youdao didn't stop attacking, instead intensifying his assault.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, "It seems I have no choice but to fight Daoist Wu today. Let's see what skills you have to stop me!"</p><p>Wu Youdao was not a veteran Golden Core cultivator. His two magic treasures were thanks to the legacy of Qingyang Demon Sect's ancestors. Some cultivators who achieved Golden Core around the same time as him were still struggling to gather materials to refine their own magic treasures.</p><p>After fighting for so long, Qin Sang had a good understanding of Wu Youdao's magic treasure.  Unless Wu Youdao had hidden other methods, Qin Sang was confident that he would not be suppressed before his True Essence was exhausted.</p><p>During the fight, he also learned quite a few fire-controlling techniques from Wu Youdao.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner swelled to several meters tall, standing upright before Qin Sang. The banner fluttered, and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire obscured half the sky.</p><p>The other half was Wu Youdao's Qingyang Demon Fire.</p><p>Black and green, two seas of flames clashed wildly, impacting each other.</p><p>Each wave was larger than the last, piling up a black and green volcano in the middle of the fiery sea.</p><p>The demonic fire's aura swept across the land, causing the mountain's birds and beasts to flee.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Li Qing emerged from the restricted area and flew towards Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>His expression was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Returning to Shen Gang Peak, Li Qing found his fellow disciples gathered around a vortex, but not attempting a rescue.  He scanned the crowd, found an elder, and asked, "Senior Brother Ji, why aren't you rescuing them?"</p><p>"Junior Brother Li is back," Elder Ji hurried over, concernedly asking, "How was the restricted area? What treasures were stolen by the thief?"</p><p>Li Qing hesitated, "Following Uncle Master Wu's instructions, I carefully checked the restricted area. I found no signs of intrusion.  The important areas and treasures were untouched.  Even… the protective spirit array of the restricted area showed no signs of being broken."</p><p>Elder Ji was also surprised, turning to look at the vortex, "I've had people patrol everywhere, and found no other abnormalities.  A Golden Core cultivator sneaking in just for a piece of Gang Jade? He could have simply asked; Uncle Master Wu wouldn't have refused, right? Why go to such great lengths, putting himself in danger?"</p><p>"Not necessarily!"</p><p>Li Qing shook his head, "Some time ago, I heard the Sect Master mention to Uncle Master Wu that the Ancestral Saint Fire would soon enter a new period of dormancy.  Upon awakening, it will be even harder to control, requiring more Gang Jade.  Our cultivators above the Fake Dan stage need to refine the demonic fire by absorbing the pure Gang Qi from Gang Jade.  If this continues, we'll eventually be unable to suppress the Ancestral Saint Fire."</p><p>Elder Ji sighed, "Our ancestor left the Saint Fire to protect future generations. Who would have thought it would one day become a major threat?"</p><p>As they spoke, a scream suddenly came from nearby.</p><p>The vortex suddenly swelled, instantly doubling in size. The lightning within the vortex writhed, its aura rampant.</p><p>The surrounding disciples almost got sucked into the vortex and quickly retreated.</p><p>The two rushed to examine it closely. Seeing that the vortex had stopped expanding, they both breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Elder Ji's expression was grave, "The two junior disciples have been trapped for too long. The wind and thunder power outside the vortex has accumulated to a terrifying degree. Fortunately, the Ancestral Saint Fire at the vortex's center hasn't lost control, otherwise, they would surely be in grave danger. We dare not use the Qinghuo Banner Formation to force a breakthrough; we can't control the flame's power and may harm them instead. To save them, Uncle Master Wu must personally intervene."</p><p>Furthermore, any delay might trigger a chain reaction. If the other crystals shatter under pressure, the consequences would be unimaginable!"</p><p>Li Qing trusted his senior brother's judgment and immediately ordered, "Repair the flying vessel at once and assemble the disciples with the green flags…"</p><p>The elder surnamed Ji glanced at Li Qing and mused, "Junior Brother Li, in my opinion, we should first inform Master Wu of the situation in the sect before making a decision."</p><p>Li Qing frowned, "Senior Brother Ji, what do you mean?"</p><p>The elder surnamed Ji transmitted his voice, "Junior Brother Li, I had several disciples assist Junior Brother Yang in repairing the flying vessel, but they reported that the damage is severe and it cannot be repaired quickly."</p><p>Li Qing coldly snorted, his expression turning dark.</p><p>The elder surnamed Ji waved his hand, "The scene of Junior Brother Wen's head being blown to bits, his blood staining the sky, certainly had a great impact on those who witnessed it. I still feel uneasy thinking about it, so we can't blame them. But that's not the point, Junior Brother Li. Consider this: if someone stole a treasure from the restricted area, we would naturally stop them at any cost.  But now, we've only lost a small piece of crystal…"</p><p>The elder paused, noticing Li Qing's thoughtful expression, then continued, "Of course, whether to kill or let him go depends on Master Wu's orders.  But we still need to prepare.  Therefore, I suggest you inform Master Wu first. Only with full knowledge of the situation can Master Wu make an informed decision."</p><p>Having finished, the elder surnamed Ji stepped aside, instructing others to check the surrounding crystals for any abnormalities.</p><p>Li Qing pondered for a moment, then turned and went down the mountain alone.</p><p>…</p><p>In the wild mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Youdao were locked in fierce battle.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Fire Gourd clashed head-on, neither yielding.</p><p>Their battle had already spanned over a dozen mountain peaks, leaving scorched earth in its wake.</p><p>Qin Sang was now desperate.</p><p>No matter what he said or did, Wu Youdao ignored him, showing no sign of stopping. Qin Sang wondered if Wu Youdao had discovered something.</p><p>While fighting, Qin Sang carefully calculated his remaining spiritual energy.  He estimated he could hold out for another half an hour.</p><p>If he couldn't force Wu Youdao back within half an hour, he would have to use the Void Thunder.</p><p>He only had one chance.</p>
