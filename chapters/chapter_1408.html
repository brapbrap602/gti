第一千四百章 Three Spirits Coiled King Formation

A stick of incense later.
The cavern dwelling was silent.
Qin Sang's expression was solemn, lost in thought.
No wonder Valley Master Mu had first lavished praise on the Pure Ocean Sect and the Myriad Spirit Fruit, his words full of enticement.
The so-called Three Spirits Coiled King Formation is a type of insect formation created using three spirit insects and the aid of an altar.
Under the effect of the insect formation and the altar, the power of two spirit insects can be drawn out and poured into the third, forcibly elevating the third spirit insect's divine abilities.
The third spirit insect is also called the Main Insect.
The Three Spirits Coiled King Formation has no requirements for the species of the spirit insects.
However, there is one condition: one of the two spirit insects being drained must have a cultivation realm higher than the Main Insect, and the other must at least be on par with the Main Insect.
This condition is easily met.
Valley Master Mu not only possessed the fourth transformation natal Gu insect, the Sea-drawing Horseshoe Crab, but had also cultivated a Black Demon Ant in the late stage of the third transformation.
He didn't even need Qin Sang to use the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.
The reason Qin Sang hesitated was that the Three Spirits Coiled King Formation would cause serious damage to the Main Insect.
The spirit insects being drained would at most be weakened for a while.
But the Main Insect would have to withstand power exceeding its own limits, forcibly activating its divine abilities. One slip-up and it might self-destruct on the spot.
Moreover, there was no guarantee of finding the entrance to the Pure Ocean Sect.
"You should have tried using Jade-biting Bees, right?" Qin Sang pondered for a long time before asking.
Valley Master Mu hesitated, knowing that he couldn't hide it from Qin Sang, and nodded with a sigh: "The difference in cultivation realm was too great. The insect formation hadn't been running for long before the Jade-biting Bee exploded and died because it couldn't withstand the pressure. Daoist Priest, rest assured, I will personally preside over the Three Spirits Coiled King Formation and minimize the damage to the Fire Jade Centipede as much as possible. As long as we can find the Myriad Spirit Fruit, the Fire Jade Centipede will recover as before."
He knew very well how precious the third transformation Fire Jade Centipede was, and spoke to reassure him.
Seeing that Qin Sang remained silent.
Valley Master Mu quickly added: "Fellow Daoists Qi and the others don't cultivate the Way of Insect Manipulation. Apart from the Spirit Raising Sacrificial Art passed on to Daoist Priest, the Myriad Spirit Fruit we obtain will be divided equally between the two of us. If there are other treasures in the Pure Ocean Sect, we will each rely on our own abilities; whoever gets it first keeps it. We'll swear an oath to that effect. What do you think, Daoist Priest?"
Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he added two more conditions: "Regardless of success or failure, I want a copy of the Three Spirits Coiled King Formation's formation method. Also, I would like to observe the Myriad Flowers Valley's secret techniques of Insect Manipulation."
Valley Master Mu looked troubled.
The Three Spirits Coiled King Formation was fine; it was insignificant because it was unlikely to be used.
But the secret techniques of Insect Manipulation concerned the very foundation of Myriad Flowers Valley. How could they be easily passed on?
"Then I'll take the Three Spirits Coiled King Formation first. After finding the Pure Ocean Sect's entrance, Fellow Daoist can then fulfill the second condition. I swear by my Heart Demon that I will never leak your esteemed sect's Insect Manipulation techniques to anyone," Qin Sang took the initiative to make an oath, dispelling Valley Master Mu's doubts.
Valley Master Mu hesitated for a moment, then nodded in agreement.
"Good! It's a deal!"
"It's a deal!"
…
Reaching a consensus.
The two of them made a prompt decision, left the cavern dwelling, and flew towards the Empty Spirit Sea.
On the way, Qin Sang learned in detail about the Pure Ocean Sect's formations from Valley Master Mu.
That the Pure Ocean Sect was actually Buddhist was something Qin Sang hadn't expected.
Having gone through the Northern Chen Realm, the Canglang Sea, and traveled in the North Sea for so long, as far as Qin Sang knew, all three regions were places where the Daoist sect flourished and Buddhism was in decline.
Buddhist inheritance was incomplete, and they couldn't even find a presentable sect.
This was the first time Qin Sang had encountered such a powerful Buddhist sect.
However, Qin Sang was very clear in his heart that what Valley Master Mu had said before might not be all they knew. They were definitely hiding some information and wouldn't reveal everything to him.
Perhaps the Pure Ocean Sect had some connection with the Witch Clan.
The founding master of Myriad Flowers Valley came from the Empty Spirit Sea and obtained Witch Clan inheritance, while the Pure Ocean Sect was a sect hidden here. There must be secrets hidden within this.
Qin Sang agreed to use the Fire Jade Centipede to set up the Three Spirits Coiled King Formation because the Fire Jade Centipede was about to encounter a bottleneck, and its importance to him was less than that of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.
Playing for big stakes with small capital, this price was acceptable.
Moreover, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly might be able to break the formation, so the Fire Jade Centipede might not be needed.
The Empty Spirit Sea was indeed as rumored.
All around were boundless seas, uniform and monotonous. They flew for a long time without seeing a shadow of an island.
The sea surface was without wind, and there were hardly any waves to be seen.
Entering the Empty Spirit Sea, Qin Sang followed Valley Master Mu and flew for another hour, arriving at a vacant sea area.
Valley Master Mu suddenly descended to the sea surface and flicked his finger, sending a stream of light into the sea.
After a moment, Qin Sang sensed two auras rapidly approaching from the seabed.
'Splash...'
Two figures broke through the water.
One male and one female.
The man was tall and thin, wearing a Daoist robe and a tall crown, with prominent cheekbones; he was Fellow Daoist Qi, as mentioned by Valley Master Mu.
The female cultivator was also dressed as a Daoist nun, and was a close friend of the Qi-surnamed cultivator, surnamed Wang.
Both were in the early stage of the Nascent Soul realm.
"Fellow Daoist Qi! Fellow Daoist Wang!"
Having been introduced by Valley Master Mu, Qin Sang took the initiative to step forward and give a Daoist salute.
"Greetings, Daoist Priest Mingyue!"
The two returned the greeting and smiled warmly.
After a brief exchange of greetings, the four of them plunged into the water.
The sea surface returned to calm once again.
"How deep under the water is the Pure Ocean Sect?" Seeing that they didn't stop descending, Qin Sang asked through sound transmission.
"It's almost there," the Qi-surnamed cultivator turned around, "Didn't Fellow Daoist Mu tell you? The Pure Ocean Sect should be built on an island, but we can't find that island now. Moreover, the formation is very strange. If it hadn't been for an anomaly that appeared once, even if I passed by this place, I probably wouldn't have realized there was something strange here."
Qin Sang nodded lightly and said, "It's difficult to describe clearly with just words. I need to experience it personally to understand the peculiarity of the formation accurately."
Valley Master Mu slowed down his escape speed and aligned himself with them, turning his head to ask the Qi-surnamed cultivator, "Have there been any new changes these days?"
The Qi-surnamed cultivator shook his head and said, "Since that brief anomaly, nothing has appeared again. This time, we'll have to see what you two Daoist Priests can do. If it still doesn't work, I'm afraid we can only try our luck at the Myriad Demons Assembly."
"The Myriad Demons Assembly?"
A look of surprise appeared in Qin Sang's eyes.
Valley Master Mu 'oh'ed and explained, "Daoist Priest has only recently arrived at the Boundless Sea, so you may not be aware. In nine years is the date of the next Myriad Demons Assembly, which is essentially an auction or trade fair for Nascent Souls in the Boundless Sea. At that time, experts from the Boundless Sea will flock to Chaos Demon Island, not limited to the Demonic Path, and even Demon Kings will appear. However, the various forces of the Boundless Sea have a pre-existing agreement that even if there are deep-seated grudges between them, they are not allowed to fight on Chaos Demon Island, otherwise, they will be jointly attacked. With the Chaos Demon Old Man personally in charge, I haven't heard of anyone daring to break the rules in past Myriad Demons Assemblies. If Daoist Priest is interested, you can go and take a look at that time..."
The Qi-surnamed cultivator nodded, "That's right, at each Myriad Demons Assembly, there are always important treasures that appear. Perhaps there will be a treasure that can break this formation. When the Myriad Demons Assembly is approaching, a vague list of treasures will leak out in advance. Daoist Priest can take a look first to see if there is anything of interest."
Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully.
