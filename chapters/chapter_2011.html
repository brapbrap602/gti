<h1>Chapter 2002: Li'er</h1><p>The bronze drum flew north, almost to the edge of the Extreme Heaven Peak's sea region.  No islands were visible in the surrounding expanse, yet Mister Hong showed no sign of stopping.</p><p>Continuing north, desolate, uninhabited islands began to appear more frequently.  Arriving at a vast, empty stretch of sea, the bronze drum's speed abruptly slowed, and Mister Hong tapped his toe on the drum's surface.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>With a faint drumbeat, the void trembled, ripples appearing in the air. A blurry shadow, like a small island, materialized on the sea's surface ahead.</p><p>The shadow gradually sharpened, revealing itself to be an island previously concealed by a spirit formation, now reappearing before everyone.</p><p>The island wasn't large, only ten or so miles in circumference, and although devoid of any structures, it couldn't be considered desolate.</p><p>The entire island was shaped like a saddle, its sloping sides covered in flowers.  No rare varieties were present, but each bloom was strikingly beautiful.  Countless butterflies danced among the blossoms, creating a vibrant tapestry of color and a truly enchanting scene.</p><p>At the heart of this floral sea, in the saddle's center, lay the only patch of green.  The grass was soft and luxurious as brocade, inviting one to imagine lying there, bathed in sunlight, lost in perfect tranquility.</p><p>There was no one on the island. Qin Sang looked at Mister Hong's back, wondering if he was the one tending to this place.</p><p>The bronze drum landed on the shore, and Qin Sang immediately caught the refreshing fragrance of the flowers.</p><p>The butterflies here were unafraid of people; several, drawn by the drum's radiant glow, landed on them.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the time he captured the Heaven's Eye Butterfly in a similarly vibrant flower valley.  Unknowingly, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had already accompanied him for over a thousand years.</p><p>“Be careful not to trample the grass, everyone, or someone might get angry,” Mister Hong said with a smile.</p><p>This 'someone' was likely the Radiant Gold City Deacon.  They would need this person's guidance later, so naturally, they couldn't offend them.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the grassy area, Huai Ting drawing close.  Only the man in the bamboo hat remained aloof, walking to a rock by the shore and sitting down in meditation.</p><p>“I wonder what kind of person this Radiant Gold City Deacon is.  Could they be a great expert at the late Void Refinement stage?”</p><p>Huai Ting asked, brimming with anticipation.</p><p>“We should meet them soon.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the north of the island, where the endless sea met the sky at the horizon. No figure was in sight.</p><p>Mister Hong offered no explanation, returning to the sea of flowers and resuming his role as a farmer.</p><p>They waited from dawn till noon, the scorching sun hanging high in the sky.</p><p>A cloud drifted in from somewhere, obscuring the intense sunlight and bringing a touch of coolness.</p><p>A breeze blew in from the north, growing stronger and stronger.  Waves crashed against the reefs, sending up white spray.</p><p>Out at sea, the weather was unpredictable.  The north quickly became shrouded in dark, ominous clouds, and faint rumbles of thunder echoed in the distance.</p><p>A storm was brewing!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's expression shifted.  He noticed that Mister Hong had also stood up from the flower sea, gazing north.</p><p>Suddenly, wind and clouds surged, lightning flashed, and thunder roared.  Amidst the raging wind and waves, a boat appeared.</p><p>It was a small, black-awninged boat, the kind meant for rivers, yet here it was, adrift at sea, seemingly unmanned.</p><p>The small boat bobbed precariously on the waves, dancing on their crests, appearing as if it might capsize at any moment.  It was pushed towards the island by the surging sea.</p><p>Qin Sang and Huai Ting both stared intently at the boat, finally exchanging glances, their expressions tinged with curiosity.</p><p>As the boat neared the island, a silver bell-like laughter suddenly rang out.</p><p>“Wow! This must be the Flower Island Sister Xing'er mentioned! So many beautiful flowers!”</p><p>The voice was like that of an innocent, carefree young girl, filled with joy. Yet the boat remained empty; the voice seemed to emanate from the boat itself.</p><p>Then, an astonishing scene unfolded.  Creaking sounds echoed from the boat, and its hull abruptly split apart.  However, it didn't completely disintegrate but rather broke into fragments of various sizes.</p><p>These fragments, though of different shapes, were all precisely formed, clearly crafted by human hands.</p><p>Then, as if alive, the fragments began to shift and reassemble, accompanied by a series of clicking sounds as mechanisms locked into place.  After a dizzying transformation, the boat had become a white tiger.</p><p>It was indistinguishable from a real white tiger, its fur, claws, mouth, and nose all lifelike, without a single flaw.  Its eyes were bright and intelligent, lacking only the ferocity of a true predator; instead, its expression held a touch of girlish innocence.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, Qin Sang realized that none of the tiger's parts were made of flesh and blood.</p><p>The white stripes of its fur were made of a spirit metal called Swallow Marrow, while the black stripes were crafted from Sunset Gold, both drawn into fine threads to create the softest fur.</p><p>Its eyes were clearly two Ghost Pupil Crystals, naturally formed in the shape of eyeballs.</p><p>Its teeth were made of Heaven's Snow Silver.</p><p>The pads of its paws were not flesh but a type of Blood Copper, which should have been as hard as steel.  Yet, somehow, it had been refined and softened to resemble flesh.</p><p>And so it was with every part of its body, crafted from various materials, some of which Qin Sang couldn't immediately identify.</p><p>This wasn't a white tiger; it was a metal behemoth!</p><p>A puppet?</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.  This metallic beast was clearly different from his Senior Sister's puppets.  Calling it a mechanical beast seemed more appropriate.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen mechanical beasts before, but they were mostly used as tools within sects, inanimate objects with significant limitations.</p><p>Each part of the white tiger was made of a different material, refined individually, and then connected with intricate mechanisms.  Although reinforced with rune formations, the formation on each part was independent, purely mechanical.</p><p>Yet, it possessed a soul. The girl's voice wasn't a disguise; it had human-like intelligence.  Qin Sang sensed the aura of a Nascent Soul. It seemed that a young girl's Nascent Soul had been somehow embedded into the mechanical beast, making it a living mechanical beast.</p><p>Qin Sang could also refine puppets using beast souls, but he didn't know how to fuse a Nascent Soul with a purely mechanical creation. He knew there were mysteries he had yet to uncover.</p><p>"So beautiful!"</p><p>The white tiger leaped into the air, landing on the island and rolling contentedly on the grass, letting out a sigh of satisfaction.</p><p>"What's your name? Where's Xing'er?"</p><p>Mister Hong inquired.</p><p>"Oh! You must be Mister Hong! Li'er greets Mister Hong!"</p><p>The white tiger sat up, politely bowing.  Then, a human-like sadness appeared on its face. "Sister Xing'er failed to gain the approval of the Profound Tiger and her Nascent Soul has withered. She has passed away."</p><p>Every movement was entirely natural, flawless.</p><p>Mister Hong sighed softly.  "I hope you succeed, Li'er.  What kind of flowers do you like?"</p><p>"Li'er likes red flowers," Li'er replied, her eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>Sensing the girl's innocence, Mister Hong couldn't help but say, "Qing'er, Cai'er, Xing'er... I've watched so many girls wither away. Your Radiant Gold City's Metal and Iron Mechanical Beasts are truly wondrous, but they are also inhumane."</p><p>Li'er didn't dare to criticize her own city, so she lowered her head and listened silently, then spat out a jade bracelet.</p><p>Mister Hong took the bracelet and nodded, then took out another jade bracelet and handed it to Li'er. He pointed at Qin Sang and the other two. "These three fellow Daoists are esteemed guests this time, all heading to the Great Zhou."</p><p>"Li'er will certainly take good care of them."</p><p>Li'er nodded vigorously.  With a leap, she bounded to Qin Sang and the others, her large eyes darting about.</p><p>Her gaze was like that of an innocent child, reflecting a pure and untainted heart.</p><p>The white tiger spat out a jade slip, saying crisply, "Esteemed guests, I am Li'er, the twenty-ninth Deacon of the Radiant Gold City's Zi Branch.  You will be entering my body. You can think of me as a ship, and I will carry you across the vast ocean to Blue Shoal Prefecture in Gen Province."</p><p>As she spoke, clicking sounds emanated from the white tiger's body.  It grew taller and longer, transforming into a giant tiger.  A door appeared on its belly, revealing three separate chambers within.</p><p>Now, it no longer resembled a normal living being.</p><p>"Oh dear, I forgot!"</p><p>Li'er stuck out her tongue, a blush appearing on her face.  She spat out another jade slip.  "This lists the passage fee. Any one of these items will suffice, esteemed guests, or something of equivalent value."</p><p>The three took turns examining the slip, which listed various spiritual items in varying quantities, all of roughly equal value.</p><p>"Can't we use spirit stones?" Huai Ting hesitated, then asked.</p><p>Li'er tilted her massive head. "Within Gen Province, spirit stones can be used for short distances, but Li'er doesn't accept them."</p><p>Qin Sang, forewarned by Master Yue Shang, was prepared. He took out three snakeskin spirit fruits, each the size of an egg.</p><p>"Three Ma Dan Fruits.  May I ask for your esteemed Daoist title?"</p><p>Li'er's eyes lit up.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Qing Feng," Qin Sang replied, retracting his hand. The spirit fruits floated into Li'er's mouth and were swallowed.</p><p>Seeing this, Huai Ting and the man in the bamboo hat also took out spiritual items and paid their fares.</p><p>"When do we depart?"</p><p>The man in the bamboo hat, who had given his name as Wen Sheng, asked as he paid.</p><p>"Li'er will stay here for ten days. During this time, other fellow Daoists will arrive from elsewhere," Mister Hong replied for Li'er as he returned to tending his flowers.</p><p>"How long will it take to reach Gen Province?" Huai Ting pressed.</p><p>"Li'er has heard from the elders that this place isn't truly remote, but our human presence in the South Sea is weak, and Li'er's speed is limited.  For safety, we have to take detours and make other stops along the way. The journey will take about ten years."</p><p>Li'er explained methodically.</p><p>"Safety? Can you protect us on the way?"</p><p>Huai Ting's eyes held a scrutinizing look.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, he was seeing this kind of mechanical beast for the first time and couldn't judge Li'er's strength from appearances.  The Radiant Gold City trusted Li'er enough to send her without a Void Refinement cultivator as an escort.</p><p>However, Li'er's soul was like that of a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, making it difficult to be fully convinced.</p><p>Li'er said earnestly, "Li'er will do her utmost to protect our esteemed guests.  If we encounter danger along the way, Li'er will face life and death alongside you. However, if your enemies come seeking revenge, Li'er will not intervene."</p><p>Mister Hong added, "Li'er represents the Radiant Gold City, and on this route, the name of the Radiant Gold City still carries some weight."</p><p>Hearing this, Huai Ting said no more.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been listening silently, asked the question he cared about most. "Where is Blue Shoal Prefecture located in Gen Province?  Can you give us a map of Gen Province?"</p><p>"Blue Shoal Prefecture is in the southwest of Gen Province, bordering the South Sea. Li'er will deliver our esteemed guests to the prefectural city of Blue Shoal Prefecture. Of course, you can also disembark midway. I do have a map, but it's a very basic one. If you want a more detailed one, you can purchase it from various trading companies in Blue Shoal Prefecture."</p><p>As Li'er spoke, she spat out a scroll.</p><p>Huai Ting leaned closer to examine it. The markings were indeed simple, merely outlining the locations of the various prefectures in Gen Province with lines.</p><p>Blue Shoal Prefecture was located in a corner of Gen Province, far from the provincial capital.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, where do you plan to go? If you don't have a destination in mind, perhaps we could travel together once we reach Blue Shoal Prefecture.  We could look out for each other. I have no fixed plans, intending to wander around," Huai Ting invited.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "I'll decide where to go once I reach Gen Province, but I'm afraid it's unlikely we'll be heading in the same direction."</p><p>"I see. We'll meet again if fate allows," Huai Ting said, sensing Qin Sang's aloofness. He cupped his hands and boarded the ship first.</p><p>Qin Sang entered Li'er's belly and chose a chamber at random.</p><p>The space within was cramped.</p><p>As expected, he would likely spend the next ten years cultivating, so Qin Sang naturally didn't mind.</p><p>Thoughtfully, a small window had been placed on one side of the chamber, made of a special spirit metal that allowed one to see outside.</p><p>There were no formations separating the chambers.</p><p>Qin Sang took out several small flags and arranged them around the chamber, completely sealing it off from the inside and outside, preventing even Li'er from peering in.</p><p>Opening a small gap in the formation, Qin Sang called out, "Li'er."</p><p>"Li'er is here!"</p><p>Li'er's voice was as clear and cheerful as ever, full of energy.</p><p>"Once we reach Blue Shoal Prefecture, if we want to go to another prefecture, do we have to hire you again?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Other Deacons will be there to receive you. Besides our Radiant Gold City, there are other factions that offer similar services. Of course, if there's a Small Teleportation Formation available, that's the fastest way to travel."</p><p>"Are there many places that can't be reached by Small Teleportation Formations?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.  The Great Zhou boasted of being a unified nation, and using Teleportation Formations to connect all its regions would undoubtedly be the most efficient method.</p><p>"Li'er has heard from the elders that the world is unpredictable, filled with hidden dangers.  Sometimes, the world's spiritual energy fluctuates, powerful beings clash, or even unintentionally release their aura, which can disrupt space. If a Teleportation Formation isn't stable enough, it could be affected and send you to another part of the vast world. If you're lucky, you might survive. But if you're banished into the spatial turbulence, it's extremely dangerous," Li'er explained, a hint of fear in her voice.  She paused before continuing, "So, even if someone sets up a Teleportation Formation, without the backing of a powerful faction, no one would dare use it. Besides, Teleportation Formations aren't easy to set up; the cost is too high, and there's no point in building them for short distances. That's why our Radiant Gold City has this business. I hear that the Great Teleportation Formation from Gen Province to White Jade Capital has always been the only one, and no one has ever been able to build a second one..."</p><p>Li'er was quite approachable, willingly answering any questions that didn't involve the Radiant Gold City's secrets.</p><p>After this exchange, Qin Sang had a general impression, but he would have to see for himself to truly understand the landscape of the Great Zhou cultivation world.</p><p>On the third day of waiting, a streak of light flew in from the distance. The person seemed to know Mister Hong, and they talked for a while before boarding. Li'er created another chamber.</p><p>Over the next ten days, people arrived one after another, eventually totaling more than ten, causing Li'er's body to lengthen considerably.</p><p>Qin Sang observed them through the window but didn't go out to socialize.  These individuals also kept to themselves in their chambers, not seeking to make friends.</p><p>They were merely fellow travelers, not interfering with each other.</p><p>On the evening of the tenth day, Li'er leaped forward with all four paws and bounded towards the open sea.</p>
