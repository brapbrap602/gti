<h1>Chapter 2073: The Precious Tree</h1><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After Qing Jun and Qin Sang both left, this place became a sacred land of the Green Ram Temple. Occasionally, sword cultivators would come to pay their respects to Qing Zhu. The valley's layout remained almost unchanged.</p><p>Yu Nu learned the art of winemaking, using the valley's peach blossoms to brew peach blossom wine. Excitedly, she retrieved a sealed jar and invited Qin Sang to taste it.</p><p>It was the same pavilion, the same peach blossom wine, but the person across from him had changed. The one from all those years ago was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his wine cup. The fragrance of the wine filled his nostrils.</p><p>As the sweet nectar flowed down his throat, Qin Sang closed his eyes to savor the taste for a moment, then praised, "Good wine."</p><p>Yu Nu was delighted, her eyes crinkling into a smile.</p><p>Not staying long, Qin Sang bid farewell to Yu Nu and, taking Li Yufu with him, flew eastward for a while, arriving at a mortal realm.</p><p>The morning mist below had yet to disperse.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a peaceful village, nestled between mountains and water, quiet and serene, surrounded by pleasant scenery.</p><p>However, the villagers were far from ordinary. Many possessed the aura of cultivators. The seemingly ordinary village was actually protected by a formation, and the visible scenery wasn't the whole picture. There was another world within.</p><p>Even ordinary cultivation families wouldn't have such grand arrangements.</p><p>"It is said that this is Sect Master Mu's hometown. Sect Master Mu asked Mount Shaohua to bury him here…"</p><p>Li Yufu pointed down below.</p><p>Behind the village, also the area heavily guarded by the formation, there was a tomb. It was Mu Yifeng's tomb!</p><p>Although the formation here was strong, it couldn't compare to the mountain-protecting formations of various sects. Naturally, it couldn't stop them. Without any visible action from Qin Sang, they passed through the formation, arriving before the tomb on the back mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang placed down a jug of wine and silently gazed at the tombstone.</p><p>He hadn't had many friends before, and those he could truly confide in were even rarer. Tan Hao was gone, and now Mu Yifeng was gone too.</p><p>In front of the Bronze Palace, Mu Yifeng shattering his Nine Fire Divine Edge to spare his life was a scene still vivid in his memory.</p><p>Li Yufu sensed his master's sorrow and sighed inwardly. Both Fairy Liu Li and he knew the deep bond between his master and Sect Master Mu. Naturally, they wouldn't lack Sect Master Mu's Azure Spirit Energy, but ultimately, they couldn't reverse fate.</p><p>Just then, Li Yufu suddenly felt an approaching aura. Moments later, a streak of light appeared in the sky. The light seemed to be passing by, but midway, it abruptly changed course and descended towards them.</p><p>This streak of light also concealed its presence, not alarming the cultivators in the village.</p><p>Li Yufu was somewhat surprised. The newcomer was actually the current Mount Shaohua Sect Master—Qiu Mubai.</p><p>Immediately after, Li Yufu noticed Qiu Mubai staring at him in astonishment. He was taken aback, then realized that his master hadn't used any technique to conceal their presence.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly turned around. He hadn't intended to pay a formal visit, but since they had met here, there was no need to deliberately avoid each other.</p><p>Recognizing Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai's entire body trembled. Moreover, Qin Sang hadn't concealed his cultivation from him. Sensing the vast and profound aura emanating from Qin Sang, he was even more shocked.</p><p>Qiu Mubai had never imagined he would face this Junior Brother Qin again in his lifetime. Caught off guard, he was momentarily at a loss for words. As a sect master and a Nascent Soul Initial Stage expert, it had been a long time since he had lost his composure like this.</p><p>It was Qin Sang who first cupped his hands and greeted, "Fellow Daoist Qiu."</p><p>Qiu Mubai's expression shifted slightly as he composed himself and solemnly returned the greeting, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang's address of "Fellow Daoist" indicated his stance.</p><p>With Mu Yifeng gone, the connection between Qin Sang and Mount Shaohua was completely severed.</p><p>Everything that had happened at Mount Shaohua was in the past. Both gratitude and resentment had dissipated with the wind. Qin Sang wouldn't hold a grudge against Dong Yangbo for making things difficult for him.</p><p>No blame, nor preferential treatment. From now on, they were merely fellow Daoists.</p><p>For Qiu Mubai, this was undoubtedly the best outcome.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang didn't speak again, continuing to silently gaze at Mu Yifeng's tombstone. Qiu Mubai's mind was still in turmoil, unsure of what to say.</p><p>Li Yufu felt the atmosphere was somewhat awkward and asked, "Sect Master Qiu, are you also here specifically to pay respects to Sect Master Mu?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai replied, "I was returning from the outer sea and passing by this area. For some reason, I had a sudden urge to visit Junior Brother Mu. I didn't expect to encounter the two fellow Daoists here."</p><p>The more he spoke, the smoother his words became. He also realized that Qin Sang hadn't exerted any pressure on him. Everything stemmed from his own mental barrier.</p><p>Realizing this, Qiu Mubai felt a little more relaxed. Looking at Mu Yifeng's tombstone, he said, half narrating and half explaining, "When Junior Brother Mu returned heavily injured that time, I thought he would, as before, turn misfortune into blessing and use this to break through his bottleneck…"</p><p>Saying this, Qiu Mubai gave a kind smile.</p><p>Qin Sang also revealed a hint of a smile. It seemed everyone knew about Mu Yifeng's "characteristic." Unfortunately, good luck couldn't last forever.</p><p>"Did you find the person who injured him?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qiu Mubai's face showed shame. "The enemy is an island lord of the Chang You Clan, whose cultivation is a level higher than mine. He always stays at the rear and rarely appears on the battlefield. I haven't been able to find an opportunity to avenge Junior Brother Mu!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said calmly, "Leave this person to me."</p><p>They talked for a while longer at the tomb. Qiu Mubai invited them to visit the mountain gate, and Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>With Qiu Mubai's increased cultivation, Mount Shaohua's power was no longer what it once was. It was now one of the prominent sects among the Four Realms of the North Sea. The atmosphere of Mount Shaohua's mountain gate was also far superior to what it was back then, but the core areas remained the same.</p><p>Sword Gate Pass, Pure Moon Peak, Pagoda Peak, Dao Gate Peak…</p><p>Qin Sang constantly saw shadows of the past, and those unforgettable memories.</p><p>Qiu Mubai still cultivated in Dong Yangbo's former cave dwelling. The mountaintop was swept by wind and snow, quite desolate, and the cave dwelling's furnishings were extremely simple.</p><p>After they were seated as host and guest, Qiu Mubai didn't summon any attendants but personally served spirit tea.</p><p>The stone door was open, but the wind and snow couldn't penetrate at all.</p><p>Qiu Mubai said "Please," took a sip from his jade cup, and looked outside through the swirling tea mist. He softly said, "Reviving the sect was Master's lifelong wish, as well as Junior Brother Mu's. Back then, when I took over the position of sect master from Junior Brother Mu, I was always apprehensive, treading on thin ice."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. "Dong Yangbo certainly wouldn't have imagined that Mount Shaohua could achieve such grandeur. Fellow Daoist has done a very good job."</p><p>"If we were in the lower realms, perhaps we could say that. But looking at the vast world, the countless powerful races, the countless mysterious forces, a single Chang You Clan can trap us here. What does a small Mount Shaohua amount to?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai sighed. "The road ahead is full of internal and external troubles. Back then, Master told me not to be too concerned about the sect, but I ultimately couldn't do it."</p><p>"The internal troubles Fellow Daoist speaks of, are they related to cultivation methods?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qiu Mubai's expression became serious. "Precisely!"</p><p>This was the biggest problem facing all cultivators and sects, and Mount Shaohua was no exception.</p><p>But thinking about how Dong Yangbo treated Qin Sang back then, it was already fortunate that Qin Sang wasn't filled with resentment. How could he dare to hope for anything else?</p><p>Now that Qin Sang took the initiative to ask, it ignited a glimmer of hope within him.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "If there were a Great Dao placed before Fellow Daoist, but it required changing cultivation methods, what would Fellow Daoist choose?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai's expression solidified. After a moment of contemplation, he asked, "Would it require changing sects?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "It's neither necessary nor impossible."</p><p>Qiu Mubai understood. No need to change sects meant he could stay in his original sect. But cultivation methods wouldn't be easily transmitted. Cultivating its method meant inheriting its karma. The best outcome would be to honor it and regard it as the superior sect!</p><p>The worst outcome would be that all the sect's disciples would be attracted to the cultivation method leading to the Great Dao and switch to cultivating it, while the sect's own method would gradually be forgotten. Cultivating its method, admiring its Dao, hearts would change, and it would be irreversible.</p><p>Cultivators yearning for the Great Dao was not an empty phrase. Unless Qin Sang set a threshold, everyone would pursue the Great Dao. Who would willingly join a sect with incomplete cultivation methods?</p><p>By then, their own sect's teachings would silently disappear, and the sect would exist in name only.</p><p>Qiu Mubai lowered his head, lost in deep thought. This was an incredibly difficult decision. He knew that with Qin Sang's strength and prestige, he could completely forcibly unify the Storm Realm and destroy other sects. No one could stop his will.</p><p>He hadn't done so, which meant he was giving each sect a chance, preserving a sliver of their lineage. Of course, regardless of Qin Sang's choice, the Green Ram Temple would definitely become the ruler of the Storm Realm, surpassing all other forces.</p><p>Finally, Qiu Mubai let out a long sigh and cautiously said, "Thinking of myself, for the sake of the Great Dao, I am willing to cultivate this method. But thinking of the sect, the sect's teachings cannot be extinguished, and the disciples cannot be broken. Even if I borrow another path to reach a higher realm, I will still return and deduce cultivation methods for my sect!"</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, stood up, and said, "I have just returned not long ago and still need to visit other places, so I won't disturb Fellow Daoist any further.  Regarding today's matter, I hope Fellow Daoist will refrain from revealing it for the time being."</p><p>"I understand."</p><p>Qiu Mubai escorted Qin Sang and Li Yufu out of the cave dwelling. Standing on the mountain peak, his figure remained motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Li Yufu followed behind Qin Sang, his heart filled with excitement.</p><p>His master hadn't explicitly stated it, but it wasn't difficult for him to guess. A grand and vast picture had already been painted in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that Qiu Mubai's attitude should represent most of the sects in the Storm Realm. In any case, when faced with the crisis of a severed cultivation path, if a cultivation method was presented to them, it would be impossible to completely reject it.</p><p>However, if someone was firm enough, as long as it didn't harm his Dao Lineage, he wouldn't necessarily be intolerant.</p><p>Leaving Mount Shaohua, they continued north. Qin Sang learned that Patriarch Han was still alive.</p><p>Back then, when the Pure Yang Sect split, Patriarch Han followed one faction. Later, his cultivation matured, and he subdued the other half of his fellow disciples, restoring the Pure Yang Sect and assuming the position of sect master.</p><p>However, he hadn't yet broken through to the Nascent Soul stage and was currently in secluded cultivation.  He must have obtained some kind of opportunity to have lived until now, but his lifespan was probably nearing its limit. This was his only chance.</p><p>After embarking on the path of cultivation, Qin Sang hadn't interacted much with Patriarch Han and couldn't say they were close.  But he was, after all, an old acquaintance from the Great Sui period, and they had a shared history. He instructed Li Yufu to deliver a medicinal pill without disturbing his cultivation.</p><p>They flew all the way past the Seven Great Passes, arriving at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Without the raging storms, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield had gradually returned to calm. Those ancient restrictions had become dormant, and it looked no different from other places. Mortals lived there, and cultivators also cultivated there.</p><p>The cultivators of the Storm Realm had later explored this place countless times, obtaining various opportunities.</p><p>Qin Sang flew all the way to the edge of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. It wasn't as mystical as imagined, no different from other places. The edge was the ocean, and all the mystical aspects were brought about by the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>After wandering around the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Qin Sang detected fluctuations from several ancient formations, but these no longer held any appeal for him, leaving them for those destined to find them.</p><p>Afterward, as they were about to leave the Small Cold Realm, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. Back then, a Vajra Fruit had been lost. He had asked his disciples to search for it, but to no avail.</p><p>Asking Li Yufu again, there had been no news of the Vajra Fruit all these years. He didn't know who had obtained it.</p><p>On a whim, Qin Sang unleashed his divine sense, sweeping inch by inch over the former North Star Great Desert.</p><p>After spending a considerable amount of time, there was still no trace. Just as Qin Sang was about to give up, he suddenly sensed something. His figure flickered and he arrived above the sea, appearing over a small island.</p><p>This island was located west of the North Star Great Desert, just an ordinary deserted island. Thick layers of bird droppings had accumulated on the island, and it was uninhabited.</p><p>The vegetation here was lush and vibrant. Qin Sang, however, spotted a slender sapling within the jungle.</p><p>The sapling was only knee-high, its trunk thin, with only a few green leaves. It was surrounded by towering ancient trees that blocked out the sunlight.</p><p>It appeared to be an ordinary sapling. Unless the surrounding ancient trees died, there would be no room for it to grow.</p><p>"That Vajra Fruit actually took root and sprouted here!"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. This was indeed a young Vajra Bodhi Tree!</p><p>This tree didn't exhibit any mystical qualities. If Qin Sang hadn't personally seen a true Vajra Bodhi Tree and found the leaf shape somewhat familiar, he might have overlooked it.</p><p>However, the Vajra Bodhi Tree he had seen had golden leaves and a massive trunk, while this sapling only revealed a hint of gold within its veins upon closer inspection.</p><p>This difference might be due to the divine object concealing itself. Before the divine tree matured, it wouldn't reveal its mystical qualities.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept over the entire island. There were no cultivators' cave dwellings here, nor were there any skeletons around. It was unknown how it ended up here.</p><p>Once a Vajra Fruit grew into a Vajra Bodhi Tree, it lost its inherent properties. Only when the divine tree bore new Vajra Fruits would it become one of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>It was unknown how many years and months it would take to see that.</p><p>Regardless, this was an unexpected delight. Such a divine tree, even if it didn't bear fruit, could serve as a treasure of the Green Ram Temple, no less valuable than any other treasure in the world.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a formation, drawing upon the earth's veins, making thorough arrangements before carefully digging out the Vajra Bodhi Tree and temporarily placing it within his Small Cave Heaven. He would transplant it to a suitable location later.</p><p>Then, they left the Small Cold Realm, heading straight for the Hidden Sun Realm, one of the Four Realms of North Star.</p><p>Outside the Heavenly Profound Palace's mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu stood on the snow-covered mountain peak. After waiting for a moment, a figure flew towards them from afar, transmitting its voice from a distance, "Since Temple Master has come to visit, why not come in and be our guest?"</p><p>The newcomer was Tong Lingyu, the current Palace Master of the Heavenly Profound Palace.</p><p>To plan for his Dao Lineage, Qin Sang wouldn't openly reveal himself, but he still needed to meet with those trusted old friends, giving them confidence and enabling them to cooperate with his actions.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin?"</p><p>As expected, upon seeing Qin Sang, Tong Lingyu was also shocked, his mind shaken.</p><p>After the two reminisced for a while, Tong Lingyu sighed from the bottom of his heart, "It's a pity Liu Li isn't here! You know her temperament. Once she sets her mind on something, even nine dragons can't pull her back. All these years, she has shouldered the burden of a realm alone. Finally, there's someone who can share it with her."</p>
