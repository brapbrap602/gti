<h1>Chapter 1446: Miscalculation</h1><p>What secrets does the jade sword hold?</p><p>Is it connected to the Jinghai Sect?</p><p>…</p><p>Although the jade sword was found in a Buddhist temple, it was clutched in the hand of a corpse; it may not be a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the jade sword, these questions flashing quickly through her mind.  She recalled the seven-story pagoda of unknown purpose in her possession, wondering if the two artifacts might be connected.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no intention of acquiring the jade sword. Instead, she pondered the seller's motives.</p><p>There's a fifty percent chance that the person in the bamboo tower is the Hunmo Elder. He shouldn't lack usable artifacts, and he should value such an artifact with hidden secrets even more.</p><p>Could he be trying to lure out someone who truly understands its secrets?</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang leaned back in her chair, unconcerned whether the Hunmo Elder was targeting her or someone else. She wouldn't get involved rashly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed the surrounding chatter had noticeably subsided. The jade sword was indeed unusual.</p><p>But it wasn't unusual enough to warrant the price of a top-grade artifact.</p><p>Several people attempted to bid, but seeing the owner's stubbornness, they lost interest.</p><p>The transaction failed.  The Chongtai Venerable moved on to the next bamboo tower.</p><p>Inside the bamboo tower:</p><p>The Hunmo Elder retrieved the jade sword.  Holding the jade sword in one hand and the Lingzhi Ruyi in the other, his expression was confused.</p><p>True energy surged in.</p><p>A small white orb appeared within the jade sword.</p><p>The Guanyin on the Lingzhi Ruyi also glowed, its closed eyes seeming about to open.</p><p>If anyone had entered the bamboo tower at that moment, they would have noticed that the two artifacts emitted similar energy fluctuations. The jade sword's aura was slightly weaker, a mere imitation.</p><p>However, unless the two artifacts were placed together, or one had seen them before, the average person wouldn't notice the difference.</p><p>“The jade sword's crafting method is similar to the Lingzhi Ruyi.  I spent two years meticulously refining it, disguising its energy to mimic the other. The Xuantian Palace should buy it to investigate.  This would confirm my information and avoid alarming anyone. Why haven't they acted? Did I guess wrong?”</p><p>The Hunmo Elder muttered to himself.</p><p>Seeming unsatisfied with the lack of confirmation, the Hunmo Elder repeatedly examined the Lingzhi Ruyi, his expression less certain.</p><p>He regretted not developing his forces earlier, focusing solely on cultivation to avoid worldly affairs.  Things would have been much easier.</p><p>The Wanmo Conference was backed by several of the strongest forces in the Boundless Sea, mutually restraining each other. He could only influence minor matters, not control them.</p><p>After much deliberation, the Hunmo Elder put the jade sword back up for sale.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was still contemplating the Hunmo Elder's intentions when she saw her jade token light up.  Activating the inscription on the token, she was transported to the Chongtai Venerable's side.</p><p>The "Seven Master Buddha Seal" and the materials needed for refining the Jinchen Sword were all obtained.  Only the Yousha Thorn was costly; everything after that was more affordable.</p><p>“Yuan Yin Water, Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit, Yinming Earth…”</p><p>Qin Sang openly sought these spiritual materials.</p><p>Based on prior information, Qin Sang believed the Mu Valley Master was likely still alive.</p><p>Having the Mu Valley Master here was advantageous, allowing her to reconnect.</p><p>Even if the Mu Valley Master had died at the hands of the Hunmo Elder, she didn't worry.  The Hunmo Elder hadn't gone directly to the medicinal garden upon entering the Jinghai Sect, implying he hadn't performed soul searching, or had failed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang received a response.</p><p>The other party had two Seven-Colored Spirit Fruits, but wasn't interested in the three herbs Qin Sang offered.</p><p>During the final free exchange, after several rounds of trading, Qin Sang gave up two herbs and finally obtained two Seven-Colored Spirit Fruits and the second drop of Tianmian Heavy Liquid.</p><p>Each spiritual advancement requires a complete Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit. This was to prioritize the Fire Jade Centipede and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>As for the Yuan Yin Water and Yinming Earth, they never appeared at the exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang changed tactics, asking if anyone knew the whereabouts of these two spiritual materials, but found nothing. It seemed a trip to the Hundred Flowers Valley was necessary.</p><p>The exchange was drawing to a close.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a sigh, feeling exhaustion.  The mental strain of maneuvering with these old foxes, probing their limits, was comparable to a major battle.</p><p>Her gaze fell on the jade sword, still unsold.</p><p>Throughout the exchange, she had kept an eye on that bamboo tower.  The jade sword's owner remained steadfast, refusing to lower the price despite the lack of interest.</p><p>“If it’s the Hunmo Elder, why sell the jade sword separately?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, unable to fathom his intentions.</p><p>Soon, the Venerable Chongtai announced the end of the trade fair. The layout of the lake island changed rapidly; the bamboo houses shifted and were completely scrambled, finally disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang got up, left the room, gave the jade pendant and spirit stones to the puppet maid, and left Lake Island via the light bridge.</p><p>Shortly after, figures with escaping light frequently appeared above Wanmo City, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't head south directly but changed directions several times, checking for any signs of being followed.</p><p>...</p><p>On Lake Island.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder put away the unsold jade sword, his expression unusually gloomy.</p><p>Then, his eyes suddenly narrowed, as if realizing something. He hurriedly left the bamboo house, then his figure flickered and vanished into thin air.</p><p>On the outskirts of Wanmo City, in a low, ordinary courtyard.</p><p>The interior was simply furnished, like that of an average commoner's house. Yet, two mysterious figures in black robes sat cross-legged inside, looking out of place.</p><p>The two remained motionless, without any aura, like corpses.</p><p>Between them floated a black magic eye.  It opened and closed, extending several invisible threads outwards, disappearing into the distance, their destination unknown.</p><p>Suddenly, both opened their eyes and looked towards the door.</p><p>A figure appeared at the entrance—the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The two hurriedly rose and bowed.</p><p>"The trade fair is over.  Has the Xuan Tian Palace not yet acted?" the Hunmo Elder asked, his voice grim.</p><p>"The trade fair ended?"</p><p>The two were startled, immediately realizing something was wrong.  They replied nervously, "The messages from our subordinates were all normal. The three Xuan Tian Palace elders should be waiting for news and haven't made a move…"</p><p>Before they could finish, the Hunmo Elder cursed them as fools, no longer concealing his anger. He turned into a streak of light and dashed towards a distant courtyard.</p><p>The two disciples' faces fell, and they quickly followed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The courtyard was protected by a hidden restriction.  Several icy-white blasts of cold energy surged towards the intruder.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder snorted coldly, striking out with his black bamboo staff, dispersing the cold energy before bursting into the main hall.  He glanced around, then flashed into the back hall.</p><p>There, he found only three ice sculptures, identical in appearance and aura to the three elders.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The Hunmo Elder laughed angrily, shattering the ice sculptures with his staff and glared fiercely at his two disciples.</p><p>The two disciples stared dumbfounded.  After receiving their instructions, they had been secretly monitoring the elders' residence using secret techniques, avoiding alerting them.</p>
