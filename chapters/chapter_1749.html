<h1>Chapter 1740: Vermilion Bird, Qilin, Phoenix, and Azure Luan</h1><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird believed it had Qin Sang firmly in its grasp, ready to manipulate him as it pleased. Little did it know, Qin Sang's thoughts were elsewhere.</p><p>An ancient divine beast, the Qilin, had transformed into a seed of origin and fallen into this realm. This made Qin Sang think of the "ancients" he had encountered before. According to the Ghost Mother, the Immortal Palace and its inhabitants, such as the spirit of the Vermilion Bird, Bai, and the Demon Lord, had different origins. Beyond the Immortal Palace, there were also ancient powerhouses trapped in this realm.</p><p>The Witch Clan had the Ghost Mother. Among the ancient demons, there was the Jade Bone Demon sealed in the Palace of Sinful Deities and the demon suppressed beneath the Pure Sea Sect. Even among the demonic beasts, the Qilin seed was not the first remnant spirit Qin Sang had encountered. Back in the Northern Dipper Realm, when he obtained the stone slab, his soul had been assaulted by the remnant spirit of the Azure Luan.</p><p>The Qilin seed tempted others to cultivate secret techniques, allowing it to revive within their bodies. The remnant spirit of the Azure Luan lay in wait, dormant until someone with a compatible aura touched the stone slab, awakening it to directly attack their soul. In essence, both were methods of possession.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but draw connections. Aside from humans, he had encountered ancient powerhouses from the Witch, Demon, and Beast Clans! These powerhouses were either sealed or reduced to remnant spirits, and they all ended up in the same minor world. It was hard to believe this was mere coincidence.</p><p>Could it be that an ancient war had once swept through all races, and even these mighty beings were not spared, cast down to the mortal realm, with this minor world unfortunately chosen as the battlefield? What was most intriguing was that these powerhouses seemed to have foreseen their predicament, preparing means to escape this realm, each using their own methods, none of which were the normal paths to ascension.</p><p>The Demon Clan had set up an Ascension Platform. The Witch Clan had connections in the upper realm, allowing them to break through the boundaries and ascend. The Beast Clan simply usurped others' nests, hiding in plain sight. Were there any human powerhouses with similar experiences, and what means had they left behind?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly frowned. He had a feeling that these powerhouses from the three clans seemed to be afraid of something. Were they all like the Ghost Mother, sealed below the Divine Transformation realm, unable to break through in this world, unable to enter the Ruins? Or was there some unknown danger at the Dao Mark of this realm, making them afraid to go there?</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound and felt an inexplicable unease about the Dao Mark's gate. If he was fortunate enough to find the Ascension Platform, should he still explore the Ruins? Could there be some great terror within?</p><p>He didn't know when the Immortal Palace had fallen into this realm, but perhaps he could learn something from the spirit of the Vermilion Bird to verify the Ghost Mother's words.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang suppressed his scattered thoughts and glanced at the chattering flock of nine divine birds. He pondered for a moment before speaking, "If what you say is true, and you haven't deceived me, then not only can you save my life and grant me a great opportunity, but you can also protect my descendants. I truly can't think of a reason to refuse. However..."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone suddenly shifted, "Precisely because of this, I find it hard to believe that such a good thing exists. Even if the Qilin's origin can be found, it must be difficult to subdue, right?"</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird sneered, "Of course, it's not that easy. Unless the Qilin was on the verge of death, it would have left behind means to protect its origin. With your current level of cultivation, don't even think about it."</p><p>In this realm, only the spirit of the Vermilion Bird would dare to look down on a Divine Transformation cultivator. Qin Sang wasn't angered; instead, he smiled. "So, you don't have the ability to devour the Qilin's origin either? Even if we find it in the future, you don't have full confidence. Bringing me along is actually just to find a helper."</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird was momentarily stunned, then angrily retorted, "There are plenty of people in this world who want to help me find the Qilin's origin. You're the only one who doesn't appreciate it! If your strength isn't up to par by then, I won't bring a burden along."</p><p>Qin Sang soothed, "Please calm down, senior. I just want to confirm that I am of use to you, so I can feel at ease following you. Rest assured, my determination to pursue the Dao is no less than anyone else's. Even without the temptation of the Qilin's origin, I would still strive to improve."</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird snorted, its anger slightly abated.</p><p>Looking at the Sun Divine Tree, a strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He had provoked the spirit of the Vermilion Bird for a reason. Since its appearance, he had been silently observing, subtly probing its strength.</p><p>"Senior, don't you feel any discomfort?" Qin Sang suddenly asked a seemingly random question, his expression somewhat eerie.</p><p>"What do you mean?" The spirit of the Vermilion Bird was puzzled.</p><p>"Nothing," Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "I'm just worried that extracting the essence from the Qilin seed might not be compatible with your true spirit. If something goes wrong, not only would you suffer backlash, but I would also be affected, possibly dying even faster."</p><p>As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at the Sun Divine Tree a few more times.</p><p>Since its appearance, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird had not mentioned the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound at all. Judging from its tone, it didn't seem to be affected by it. Could it be unaware? After all, even the Five Elements Crown's demonic spirit, which had not yet formed a tool spirit, had gone mad due to the demonic sound. Could the spirit of the Vermilion Bird be inferior to a demonic spirit?</p><p>A Vermilion Bird spirit that couldn't sense the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound—how many divine birds could it truly control?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that when he was alone, he naturally wouldn't casually mention the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound. When gathering experts from various regions to discuss important matters, he either informed them through telepathy or avoided taking out the Sun Divine Tree in front of so many people.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was already tempted, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird suppressed its anger and patiently explained, "You don't need to worry about that. The essence within the Qilin seed is meant to maintain the Qilin's true spirit, making it the purest essence in the world. If the Qilin seed hadn't already taken root in your body, you could have absorbed it to strengthen your soul. But since it has merged with you, no matter what you do, it will only accelerate its revival. I'm extracting the essence to better suppress it, slowly removing its 'roots' from your body..."</p><p>After hearing this explanation, Qin Sang's heart stirred, but he feigned hesitation, looking troubled.</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird's patience was wearing thin. It angrily shouted, "What are you still worried about! With such indecisiveness, how have you survived this long!"</p><p>"It's not that I don't trust you, senior. I fully understand your intentions, and I'm willing to swear an oath to help you refine the Qilin's origin. But..." Qin Sang forced a bitter smile. "When I obtained that true feather, I was overjoyed, not realizing it was your doing. Knowing that you've been by my side for centuries, watching my every move, I can't help but feel a chill every time I think about it. It's just... unsettling."</p><p>His concern was reasonable.</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird, putting itself in Qin Sang's shoes, softened its tone and reassured him, "I spend most of my time in slumber, so it's normal that you couldn't sense me. Since you've freed me from my prison, as long as you obey, I won't harm you."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression showed surprise. "You can enter the miniature space within the Thousand Jun Ring and sleep there?"</p><p>When not in use, Qin Sang always stored the Sun Divine Tree in the Thousand Jun Ring. This was his biggest confusion. He had tried before and found that the Thousand Jun Ring couldn't store living beings. Could the spirit of the Vermilion Bird also enter the Thousand Jun Ring? Or were tool spirits and the like exceptions to this rule?</p><p>"Your iron ring is somewhat peculiar," the spirit of the Vermilion Bird said, controlling the divine bird to look at Qin Sang's right hand. On his thumb was an unremarkable black iron ring.</p><p>"When you stored me inside, I could attach my spirit to it, but all I sensed was a dark void, making me drowsy. Before I knew it, I fell into a deep slumber. Later, I realized it had no effect on me, so I let it be."</p><p>"Attach your spirit?" Qin Sang raised his right hand, examining the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>This treasure had been obtained from the remnants of the Kui Yin Sect. It was convenient to wear and more discreet than a storage pouch, with ample internal space. Even after encountering various storage treasures, Qin Sang had never replaced it.</p><p>This treasure was likely also brought out from the Purple Palace by the Kui Yin Patriarch, and it too had its secrets.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something, his expression turning serious. The Thousand Jun Ring flashed, and a bone flute appeared.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique had been obtained from this bone flute! Qin Sang only knew the first four layers of the technique; the rest was shrouded in mystery, likely due to his insufficient cultivation level.</p><p>He distinctly remembered that the bone flute also had mystical properties—it couldn't be stored in other storage treasures and had to be carried on one's person, yet it could be placed in the Thousand Jun Ring! Coincidentally, with the help of the Jade Buddha, he could also cultivate the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique from the bone flute.</p><p>Could it be...</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, his mood souring. Just how many mysterious items had been following him around?</p><p>"Senior, can you tell the origin of this item?" Qin Sang held the bone flute, opening his palm.</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird wasn't surprised. It said indifferently, "I noticed your bone flute long ago. Don't worry, it has no spirit. If it did, I would have sensed it when I attached my spirit to the Thousand Jun Ring. But don't underestimate its origin. I can't even discern the material of this bone flute."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He turned the bone flute over in his hands, examining it closely. The material seemed to be some kind of demon bone, but was there a demon bone even the Vermilion Bird couldn't recognize?</p><p>At this moment, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird suddenly chuckled, its tone mocking. "I wonder what's so special about your constitution. Among countless cultivators in the world, why have so many old fellows chosen you?"</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing its implication, focused his mind and activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation. A pair of phoenix wings spread out behind him, lightning dancing across the feathers, illuminating the cabin.</p><p>The lightning's brilliance rivaled that of the Sun Divine Tree and the true feather of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p>"Are you talking about the Azure Luan? Could there still be a remnant spirit of the Azure Luan within me?" Qin Sang glanced at the phoenix wings, his expression calm, almost accustomed to such things.</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird was mistaken about one thing—it wasn't that these beings had chosen him, but that only he could bear such encounters, thanks to the Jade Buddha. Otherwise, he would have long been possessed by the Azure Luan.</p><p>"Yes, yes!" The Sun Divine Bird nodded repeatedly. "Don't worry, the spirit of the Azure Luan has already perished. I didn't expect you to be so capable. How did you manage to devour it?"</p><p>"I didn't do much, nor did I sense the remnant spirit's presence. Perhaps the Azure Luan was already extremely weak, or even long dead," Qin Sang shrugged, then asked, "Senior, do you have a way to help me refine the lightning within these wings?"</p><p>"No!" The spirit of the Vermilion Bird replied firmly, then added, "This is likely a strand of the Azure Luan's remnant origin lightning, different from the essence of the Qilin seed. Moreover, since the Azure Luan's remnant spirit has perished, it can't erode you like the Qilin seed. This lightning is ownerless and is gradually merging with your aura, becoming part of you. No one else can interfere. Any misstep could cause the lightning to erupt, and you wouldn't be spared either."</p><p>"Merging with my aura," Qin Sang murmured, looking at the two wings. "Why don't I feel that?"</p><p>Currently, he could use the Azure Luan's lightning to perform lightning teleportation, relying on the Azure Luan's phantom. But when he tried to sense it himself, he found the lightning within the wings to be extremely狂暴, impossible to control, and he dared not act rashly.</p><p>"Either your cultivation level is insufficient, or you lack the proper method. You'll have to figure it out yourself. But if you can refine and absorb this lightning, even if you can only control it, the benefits will be endless. If it weren't for your potential, I wouldn't have taken an interest in you," the nine Sun Divine Birds raised their heads proudly, looking down at Qin Sang.</p><p>So many secrets hidden within him. Qin Sang clicked his tongue inwardly, choosing not to argue. He retracted the phoenix wings and pondered for a moment before saying, "I can agree to your third and fourth conditions and swear an oath. As for the earlier conditions, I have two requests to make before I can feel at ease. Rest assured, they won't hinder you..."</p><p>After hearing his detailed explanation, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird neither agreed nor disagreed. "Swear the oath first."</p><p>Qin Sang immediately swore a heart demon oath, vowing to do his utmost to help the spirit of the Vermilion Bird find the Qilin's origin. Until the Qilin's origin was found, he would not leave the spirit's sight, and the spirit would not harm him.</p><p>The Qilin's origin was like a mirage—if they could obtain it, they would discuss its分配 later, depending on their respective abilities.</p><p>After he swore the oath, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird, having no reason to doubt him, also made a promise. "Once I've studied and tamed that feather, if your secret technique isn't排斥 to this fire, I'll share a strand with you."</p><p>"Thank you, senior. The stronger I am, the more I can help you," Qin Sang smiled.</p><p>With the spirit of the Vermilion Bird's assistance, refining the Phoenix's true fire would likely be much easier.</p><p>"Senior, could you tell me how to absorb the essence of the Qilin seed? Only if I'm certain this method won't harm me can I fully trust you and allow you to proceed."</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird grumbled reluctantly. However, it was convinced that the Qilin seed had already taken deep root within Qin Sang. Even if Qin Sang learned how to absorb the essence, without knowing how to反客为主 and suppress the Qilin's true spirit, he would still be doomed and would have to rely on it.</p><p>Thus, the spirit of the Vermilion Bird finally agreed to teach Qin Sang the method first, to put his mind at ease.</p><p>After receiving the secret technique, Qin Sang closed his eyes and began to study it intently. This technique was vastly different from any he had practiced before, but that didn't hinder his judgment. It was indeed ingenious and profound.</p><p>Qin Sang found it fascinating, gaining much insight from just one reading. He marveled at the endless wonders of the world. The various divine abilities and secret techniques he had encountered were but the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The spirit of the Vermilion Bird, growing impatient, snapped, "Hurry up and hand over the feather!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, gazing at the Sun Divine Tree. A strange smile played on his lips as the Thousand Jun Ring flashed, and a small box flew out. Opening it revealed a translucent lotus seed.</p><p>"Senior, is this the Qilin seed you spoke of?"</p><p>A long silence followed.</p><p>Then, a piercing scream echoed through the cabin.</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p>
