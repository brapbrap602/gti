<h1>Chapter 1997: Dark Star</h1><p>Qingyang Temple, a secluded temple.</p><p>From Qin Sang's palm, countless pearls emerged, ascending into the air, emitting starlight.  Innumerable pearls formed a miniature galaxy within the cave dwelling. Qin Sang gazed at this star river, his eyes shining with a mysterious light, reflecting the endless transformations of the stars. He was contemplating the Heavenly River Reversal Array.</p><p>Around him lay the fragmented components of the array, yet he hesitated to begin refining them.  While refining magical artifacts and refining array components share similarities, they also differ. Refining array components doesn't demand extremely high skills in crafting, but mastery of array prohibitions is essential; a thorough understanding of the array about to be deployed is paramount.</p><p>All components must be harmonized in their energy. Before refining, one must have a complete vision of each component to achieve a cohesive formation, otherwise, the result will be nothing more than scrap.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang looked up, his gaze piercing through the mountain, towards the sky.  The night was moonless. The clear night sky, the countless stars gathered in the Milky Way, were so brilliant, evoking a profound sense of the vastness of space.</p><p>Qin Sang imagined himself swimming in the Milky Way, traversing between the stars, space seeming boundless, without limits, without beginning or end; he was a tireless fish.  This fish, however, harbored the ambition of leaping the Dragon Gate, constantly thrashing its tail, attempting to stir the 'waters' of the Milky Way, even to become its master.</p><p>Mastery was, of course, a delusion. Qin Sang could, at best, manipulate the Milky Way, linking the array's formation with the stars and galaxy.  But during this contemplation, delusion wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  Qin Sang allowed his thoughts to roam freely, unconstrained.</p><p>Eventually, a sudden flash of insight would strike, locking onto a point of harmony with the Heavenly River Reversal Array, after which the process would proceed smoothly. He dared to do this because of his accumulated knowledge of the celestial Dao.  Others would only drift in thought, unable to focus, unless exceptionally lucky; otherwise, they'd waste their time.</p><p>While Qin Sang contemplated the array, Taiyi was diligently cultivating in Qingyang Temple.  Qin Sang had subtly hinted at his plan to leave and journey the world, leaving Taiyi with a heavy sense of responsibility.</p><p>He naturally wished to follow his master, but understood the gravity of the situation. As a Daoist official, he had responsibilities. Remaining would allow him to oversee Qingyang Temple, easing his master's worries, and continue his cultivation of the fourth-order thunder talisman, promising a bright future. His master would surely not forget him.</p><p>Throughout the Daoist court’s history, all twenty-four governing regions had grown from a single city or region. Qingyang Temple, overseeing the entire realm, could be considered a governing region in itself. If his master decided, it might eventually become the twenty-fifth governing region of the Daoist court.  His master entrusted him with this legacy; a weighty responsibility indeed.</p><p>At the Jitian Dharma Assembly, his master had spent a fortune acquiring various treasures to enhance his cultivation.  Fearing to disappoint Qin Sang, Taiyi never slackened, seated at the main altar, immersed in his cultivation, day in and day out for ten years.</p><p>For ten years, Qin Sang and the others hadn't returned to the Azure Sky Celestial Realm; the preparations of the Four Sects were still ongoing.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang finally left his cave dwelling, entering his specially constructed refining chamber.  With a sweep of his hand, countless spiritual materials flew out, swirling around his head. These materials were all extraordinary rarities, even sealed, they displayed various wondrous properties, illuminating the room with shimmering light.</p><p>Ignoring these materials, Qin Sang picked up a broken array component, suspending it before him for examination.  Suddenly, Qin Sang's thoughts shifted, and several streams of light descended from above.  Without any visible action from Qin Sang, these streams of light were enveloped in flames, burning away impurities, leaving behind a fluid essence.</p><p>The broken component then flew towards the flames, melting and merging with the essence, appearing to a casual observer as a chaotic mixture.  Calmly, Qin Sang manipulated prohibitions, imbuing them within the mixture, gradually revealing an extraordinary texture; the basic form had appeared.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, lost in thought for a long time before continuing, patiently refining the component. After much effort, a complete array component was finally formed, exactly as he envisioned. This successful start boosted his confidence, and his speed increased, completing component after component.</p><p>Qin Sang lost track of time, unaware of how long it had passed.  The torrential flow of materials above him vanished, replaced by a collection of completed array components.</p><p>These magical artifacts varied in form. Some were round and bright like jade beads, while many others were shining swords of gold and iron.</p><p>These swords were identical in design, each engraved with seven stars on the blade, though their luster differed; some were deeper, exuding a more powerful aura.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The last seven-starred sword was finished.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, lightly flicked a finger, and the sword rang out clear and resonant.</p><p>“Finally, all are completed!”</p><p>After a moment of breath control, Qin Sang recovered, flew to the sky above Bieguan, and looked down at the land.</p><p>This formation, meant to protect the sect, needed to connect to the spiritual veins and harness the power of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Before going to Bikong Cave Heaven, Qin Sang planned to test it at Bieguan first. If successful, he would perform the Star Yuan Body Tempering there.</p><p>This required modifying Bieguan to harmonize with the formation.  Without a Nascent Soul cultivator in the sect, even with their full strength, it would take a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his divine sense, awakening those cultivating in the mountains.</p><p>The two Hongmei demons were also brought by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang highly valued them.  Their cultivation to the late Transformation stage in a shattered Lesser World, standing at the peak of that world, showed their exceptional talent.</p><p>After enduring the tribulation thunder of the Greater World, their cultivation had skyrocketed, giving them a high chance of breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>They would become the pillars of Qingyang Sect in the future.</p><p>Dozens of figures flew out from the mountains: Qingyang Sect disciples emerging from seclusion, the Hongmei demons, Ling Shi, and the remaining remnants of Luohun Abyss, including Jing Zang.</p><p>For years they had been imprisoned at Bieguan, neither killed nor released; Qin Sang ignored them, wearing down their spirits.</p><p>With the subjugation of the Luohun Abyss remnants, Yu Lang and Tai Yi would have usable forces.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered everything.</p><p>“Greetings, Grand Master.”</p><p>The Hongmei demons bowed, mimicking the address used for the Two Demon Lords, adding a ‘Grand’ prefix. Xiao Wu, finding it pleasing, followed suit, and the Two Demon Lords had no choice but to comply.</p><p>Ling Shi, having no master-disciple relationship with Qin Sang, followed Tai Yi’s example, addressing him as “Master Commander.”</p><p>The other disciples called him “Ancestor Master.”</p><p>A spiritual wind enveloped everyone, lifting them into the high air.  Standing on the clouds, those perceptive realized what was happening and their faces lit up with excitement, gazing at Qin Sang’s actions from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the previous protective mountain formation, raised both palms, facing the sky.</p><p>The earth roared, mountains shook violently, the magnitude causing concern about their destruction.</p><p>But the mountain was far stronger than anticipated. The ground on either side of the valley vibrated like a carpet, rising and falling, as if countless dragons were swimming beneath.</p><p>The energy of Heaven and Earth wildly surged, causing violent wind and a world-altering upheaval!</p><p>The Hongmei demons were mesmerized, and the Qingyang Sect disciples witnessed this earth-shattering scene for the first time.</p><p>In their eyes, the figure at the center of the storm was as majestic as a god!</p><p>The clouds cleared, the mountain remained, the earth, valley, and greenery all as before, yet it felt like a whole new world.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the artifacts, launching them one after another.  Then he conjured a mass of flowing light, transforming it into stars scattered in the void, instantly vanishing.</p><p>Finally, with a sweep of his hand, the seven-starred swords flew out simultaneously, their blades pointing downwards, piercing the earth, and also disappearing.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang completed the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation, the turmoil subsided.  The onlookers awoke as if from a dream, uncertain how much time had passed, yet this experience left an indelible mark on their hearts.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at them; the seven-starred swords flew out of the ground and towards them.</p><p>Everyone held a seven-starred sword.</p><p>“Concentrate on comprehending the magical swords.”</p><p>Qin Sang commanded.</p><p>Entrusting the seven-starred swords to his disciples—the sect united, defending against external enemies—was the strongest Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation.</p><p>The formation was versatile, adaptable to individuals; it could take the form of swords, or other shapes.</p><p>Qin Sang preferred swords.</p><p>Without delay, everyone sat cross-legged in the clouds, placing the seven-starred swords on their laps.  Mysteries flowed into their hearts, and they eagerly began their comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang released his divine sense, fully perceiving the formation.</p><p>After some time, a figure appeared from the east—Tai Yi, Yu Lang, and the Two Demon Lords arrived, along with a group of elite Qingyang Sect disciples.</p><p>They saw the seven-starred swords flying towards them upon arrival.</p><p>After a century of establishing the sect and accepting disciples, the highest cultivation among the Qingyang Sect disciples was merely Golden Core stage.  Controlling the seven-starred swords, they naturally fell far short of Nascent Soul cultivators, unable to display the full range of variations.</p><p>However, Qin Sang only used the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Formation for Star Yuan Body Tempering, requiring no other variations; with Tai Yi and the others assisting, it was sufficient, allowing the juniors to experience the wonders of a top-tier formation.</p><p>Others continued to study the Seven Stars Sword. Qin Sang retreated to a deep chasm, practicing the *Yi Gu Jue* to prepare for the infusion of stellar energy.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Ripples stirred the Black River as a figure slowly surfaced.</p><p>Qin Sang, naked, revealed a perfect body, every inch radiating immense power!</p><p>Donning a Daoist robe, Qin Sang reappeared on the mountain peak. Tai Yi and the others were leading their disciples in practicing formations, having attained a certain level of proficiency and able to operate it, albeit with difficulty.  Their role was merely to avoid hindering the process; Qin Sang himself was the true conductor of the array.</p><p>At his command, everyone assumed a solemn expression and raised their Seven Stars Swords.</p><p>*Swish swish swish!*</p><p>Tai Yi and the disciples dispersed to different locations around the mountain, each taking up a nodal point.</p><p>Simultaneously, starlight diffused, enveloping the mountain.</p><p>In an instant, the vast mountain and everyone on it vanished without a trace.</p><p>From outside, only a chaotic expanse of starlight could be seen, within which seemed to be countless stars.</p><p>Inside the Reverse Celestial River Killing Array, stars rose into the sky, eventually merging with the Milky Way above, becoming indistinguishable.</p><p>Anyone entering the array would find themselves not on a mountain, but within a vast and glorious celestial river.</p><p>The participants became integral parts of the array, their minds entirely immersed, cut off from the outside world, forgetting everything except the instructions of the array's master.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang stood on the peak, eyes closed, observing the array with his mind.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood beside him, her Sky-Eyed Butterflies flitting playfully around her, eliciting occasional silvery laughter.</p><p>After returning to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have completely forgotten her ordeal, reverting to her innocent, carefree self – a newly reborn, harmless little spirit whose ability to suppress demonic influence was all the more evident.</p><p>Suddenly, the starlight flickered.</p><p>Xiao Wu's laughter ceased, her gaze sharp as she looked towards the outside world, guarding Qin Sang alongside her Sky-Eyed Butterflies.</p><p>*Liiiit!*</p><p>A phoenix cry echoed through the starry river.</p><p>A bluish light emanated from Qin Sang's back, as the Qingluan Dharma form materialized behind him.</p><p>His eyes remained closed, he channeled part of his consciousness to connect with the array, simultaneously cultivating the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.</p><p>Every membrane, every muscle, every bone in his body was fully activated.</p><p>His blood surged, roaring like thunder.</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form tilted its head towards the heavens, restless, ready to take flight.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's mind stirred, and the previously dormant array suddenly activated!</p><p>*Clang clang clang!*</p><p>The disciples felt their Seven Stars Swords violently vibrating. Gritting their teeth, they struggled to control their swords, following the array's rhythm.</p><p>The array mirrored the celestial river, echoing the celestial river in the void. The starlight above grew increasingly brighter.</p><p>The starlight converged.</p><p>A celestial phenomenon appeared.</p><p>The cultivators of Mu Luo Mountain were startled, flying out of their caves to witness the west glowing as bright as day, starlight cascading from the night sky, clearly visible like an inverted Milky Way, rushing towards the former site of the Luohun Abyss.</p><p>Such an extraordinary celestial phenomenon must have been caused by a powerful cultivator, reminding them of the events a century ago, filling them with unease and anticipation of what might happen next.</p><p>Yun Du Heaven.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, who was in deep meditation, was disturbed, his brows furrowed. Appearing in the sky, he gazed west, then at the unusual stars. After sensing for a moment, he murmured, "It seems Daoist Qingfeng has completed the array."</p><p>With that, Gu Yun Sou vanished westward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>At that instant, it seemed as if all the starlight in the heavens was drawn here, illuminating this place alone!</p><p>Substantial starlight descended from the sky, the Milky Way hanging upside down, cascading from the heavens.</p><p>Below this river of stars was Qin Sang!</p><p>Compared to the vast celestial river, Qin Sang's form was insignificant, the mountain itself dwarfed by the cosmic torrent.</p><p>"Liiiit!"</p><p>The Qingluan Dharma form, unafraid of the celestial river, spread its wings and soared into the air.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Milky Way descended.</p><p>The full power of the killing array manifested. Qin Sang's blood nearly froze as he sensed the impending crisis.</p><p>Yet, he neither dodged nor evaded, completely absorbed, suppressing his instinct to flee, rising from the peak to receive the celestial river with his body!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Thunder exploded in Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang felt countless swords piercing his body, familiar pain washing over him like a tide.</p><p>Qin Sang was used to it, but this infusion of stellar energy was far more excruciating than before. Still, he remained unmoved, allowing the starlight to tear through him, refining his physique in the process.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang realized something unusual was occurring.</p><p>Not only was his physical body being refined in the starlight, but so was the Qingluan Dharma form.</p><p>And...</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang and the Qingluan Dharma form abruptly raised their heads, gazing at a particular point in the night sky.</p><p>There were no stars there, yet he vaguely sensed a dark star in the void, resonating with the Qingluan Dharma form.</p>
