<h1>Chapter 873: The Silver Spear</h1><p>A small shop's private room.</p><p>A burly man sipped tea listlessly, his eyes occasionally glancing towards the back room.  He was restless, his fingers twisting a jade cup, fine powder steadily falling from between them, gradually wearing away the cup's surface.</p><p>The shop attendant stared at him wide-eyed, daring not to speak.</p><p>After all, this was a high-level cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The man downed his tea in one gulp, rising to pace restlessly, each step creating a gust of wind.</p><p>The attendant finally spoke, "Senior, please be patient. Our shopkeeper's crafting skills are top-notch in the entire market; you won't be disappointed."</p><p>"You don't understand a thing!"</p><p>The burly man's eyes widened. "I spent two years at sea to catch that silver-tailed beast, finally obtaining a fist-sized throat stone to enhance my silver spear. If it's ruined, not only will I lose the stone, but my spear will also be severely damaged. Why did I let myself be swayed by those fellows and seek out an unknown craftsman? I should have known… sigh!"</p><p>The attendant, scolded, shrank his neck, not daring to retort, and scurried away.</p><p>The burly man was left alone, pacing back and forth, anxiously awaiting news from the back room but afraid to disturb whoever was inside.</p><p>His anxiety was understandable. The silver spear was his only top-tier magical weapon, crucial to his strength.  Its ruin would severely weaken him.</p><p>Just as his anxiety reached its peak, the door opened, revealing a plain-looking middle-aged man with a smile.</p><p>He held a silver spear, radiating brilliance, clearly a superior item. The spearhead was large and sharp, seemingly coated in a glaze, shimmering coldly.</p><p>The burly man rushed to the man, his face etched with urgency.</p><p>"Friend Mingyue, what's the result?"</p><p>His eyes were glued to the spear, unable to look away. The spear felt both familiar and unfamiliar, yet he knew it was his.</p><p>"Friend, see for yourself…"</p><p>The shopkeeper smiled, tossing the spear to the burly man before sitting down at the table and sipping fragrant tea.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang in disguise.  He was using a false identity to craft weapons in the market, studying the art of refinement.  Market cultivators naturally wouldn't have magical treasures for him to refine, but Qin Sang's initial understanding of prohibitions made even top-tier magical weapons workable.</p><p>He took on few jobs, choosing carefully, but the results always satisfied his clients, building his reputation.</p><p>This burly man was getting a great deal.</p><p>Qin Sang had made a breakthrough the previous day, significantly improving his crafting skills. The spear he refined for the burly man was now as powerful as those previously refined using the Nine Nether Magic Fire.</p><p>The burly man lightly moved the spear, and a blue wave shot from the spearhead. The room momentarily transformed into an underwater space, ripples spreading rapidly in all directions.</p><p>'Crack… crack…'</p><p>The jade cups on the table shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his finger, causing white light to flash on the room's walls.  He coldly snorted, "Friend, stop! Do you intend to demolish this shop?"</p><p>The burly man, jolted back to reality, hastily stopped, quickly approaching Qin Sang, bowing. "I was carried away, please forgive me…"</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>The two sat in the newly cleaned room.</p><p>The burly man no longer doubted Qin Sang, speaking with great respect.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "My luck was exceptionally good today, and your weapon had a solid foundation; that's why there was such a significant improvement.  This is unlikely to be replicated."</p><p>He didn't want to become too famous and attract unwanted attention.</p><p>However, the benefits of refining the spear were obvious. The burly man regarded Qin Sang as a master craftsman and eagerly sought to befriend him, revealing much information.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that the burly man belonged to a sect called Dianjun Mountain.</p><p>After some thought, he remembered Dianjun Mountain, a small sect on Lan Dou Island, uniquely situated on the same mountain range as the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>This mountain range, Lan Dou Mountain, was vast. The richest areas and the best spirit veins were occupied by the Lan Dou Sect, leaving smaller sects like Dianjun Mountain to settle in remote regions.</p><p>"I hear that sects near the Lan Dou Sect are closely connected. Some who achieve great merit might even be allowed to study the Lan Dou Sect's true teachings. Your water-type spiritual energy is remarkably refined. The Lan Dou Sect has a famous technique called the 'Water Breath Scripture.' Have you studied it?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>A strong man chuckled wryly, shaking his head.  "Friend, you overestimate me. My sect is insignificant; we're not even on the Lan Dou Sect's radar. Only sects affiliated with the Lan Dou Sect have such opportunities. If I'd truly seen the *Water Breathing Manual*, my cultivation wouldn't be so meager."</p><p>"Is the Lan Dou Sect's true inheritance really that powerful?" Qin Sang continued to probe.</p><p>"Of course. The resources of a major sect are beyond our imagination."</p><p>The strong man, though rough in manner, spoke with genuine respect for the Lan Dou Sect. "The Lan Dou Sect's three most famous true inheritances, the *Water Breathing Manual*, the *Wood Manipulation Canon*, and the *Yin-Yang Celestial Battle Secret Technique*, are all top-tier cultivation methods. Even their slightly less powerful true inheritances are still unattainable treasures for us…"</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly as the strong man detailed the Lan Dou Sect's true inheritances.</p><p>Recently, he'd contacted many Foundation Establishment cultivators, secretly gathering information about the Lan Dou Sect. He already knew quite a bit. But to his astonishment, none of the techniques mentioned had anything to do with stellar energy!</p><p>The strong man, more knowledgeable than those Qin Sang had previously spoken with, recounted all the true inheritances, yet none involved this type of cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang thought it odd.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect once had a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qi Yunzi, who cultivated this type of technique, but no one knew what the technique was, or even who Qi Yunzi was.</p><p>He recalled what Old Man Zhu Shan had said.</p><p>When he met Qi Yunzi, he had just entered the immortal path, while Old Man Zhu Shan was now over four hundred years old.</p><p>Someone from four hundred years ago; if something unexpected happened, it’s understandable that no one remembers him now, especially since the Lan Dou Sect has no shortage of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, a prominent sect like the Lan Dou Sect couldn’t possibly keep its true inheritances secret; only the details of the techniques themselves would remain confidential.</p><p>"Could it be that Qi Yunzi obtained the technique outside the sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder.</p><p>This was problematic; he might have chosen the wrong target.</p><p>If Qi Yunzi perished outside the sect, perhaps even in the Demon Sea, all his secrets would be lost to the wind and rain.  His hopes of learning about stellar energy infusion through Qi Yunzi were fading fast; the Scorpion Poison Grass was looking like the best option.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, while the strong man continued his enthusiastic account, finally concluding, "If you want to learn these techniques, you have to join the Lan Dou Sect. Otherwise, even if you get a chance to glimpse a true inheritance, the Lan Dou Sect won't reveal the most crucial aspects."</p>
