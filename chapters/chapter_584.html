<h1>Chapter 577: The Ancient Medicine Garden</h1><p>As the two walked, they conversed, discussing not only their own affairs but also analyzing the situation between the three realms. After the Abyss's plot was foiled, the advantage clearly lay with the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly Alliance. United, they didn't fear the Abyss and had no need to panic.  Having exposed the Sect Master of the Limitless Gate, even the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Heavenly Alliance owed them a favor, making their future prospects bright.</p><p>The Ancient Medicine Garden wasn't far from the Immortal City.</p><p>Traversing mountains and valleys, the two arrived at the Ancient Medicine Garden in no time.</p><p>It was no wonder it was called a wonderland.</p><p>The scene before them was a stark contrast to its surroundings, worthy of being described as a paradise.</p><p>Immortal clouds drifted like rosy clouds, interspersed with five-colored lights, and a rainbow hung on the horizon. It seemed as if all the most beautiful celestial phenomena in the world converged here.</p><p>The landscape was even more breathtaking. Strange peaks rose high, covered in lush greenery. Lakes of all sizes were scattered like stars, clear and bright, like the purest eyes on earth.</p><p>Countless treasures shimmered amidst the mountains and waters, some forming pillars of light, others like canopies. It was evident that heavenly treasures, divine herbs, and immortal plants thrived here, their presence marked by these extraordinary phenomena.</p><p>There were so many of these phenomena, densely packed, as if someone had gathered countless spiritual herbs from all over the world, making it impossible to take it all in.</p><p>Beneath some of these phenomena, the forms of spiritual herbs could vaguely be seen, but Qin Sang recognized almost none of them.</p><p>Even more astonishing was the presence of countless celestial birds and divine beasts: cranes, phoenixes, qilins, azure dragons, and many ancient mythical creatures.</p><p>So many ferocious beasts, each capable of dominating a region, yet they coexisted peacefully. Some slept soundly, some drank by the lake, and others soared above the immortal clouds, creating a scene of perfect harmony.</p><p>Theyâ€¦ seemed to be the guardian spirit beasts of the medicine garden!</p><p>Heavenly treasures were everywhere, dragons, phoenixes, and qilins guarded the place, and ancient mythical creatures served as mounts. Everything perfectly matched a cultivator's fantasy of immortals.</p><p>The Ancient Medicine Garden was vast, but its edges were clearly and abruptly broken, as if it were only a remnant of its former glory.</p><p>Qin Sang was awestruck. What kind of powerful being could have created this garden, collecting so many rare spiritual herbs and even capturing mythical beasts to guard it?</p><p>"These are illusions created by the Ancient Medicine Garden's restrictions.  Like the Immortal City, most of it is in ruins. It takes great luck to find a single spiritual herb here.</p><p>"Any spiritual herb found in the Ancient Medicine Garden is at least a heavenly treasure, incredibly rare. Many sects in the Small Cold Realm possess precious herbs among their treasured possessions, most of which come from here.</p><p>"Over time, the areas with weakened restrictions in the Ancient Medicine Garden have been thoroughly explored, and even some very well-hidden spiritual herbs have been found.  Some of these herbs wither when transplanted, like the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. They can only remain here, treated as prized possessions by their discoverers."</p><p>Cloud Traveler pointed ahead, warning Qin Sang not to be captivated by the false paradise, lest it disturb his Dao Heart.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously nodded. He knew these were illusions. He hadn't seen any living creatures since entering the Violet Palace, and this place was no exception.</p><p>However, the illusions were incredibly lifelike, as if such a scene had truly existed in ancient times.</p><p>Even knowing they were fake, it was hard not to be immersed in them, unable to look away, and filled with endless wonder.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the Ancient Medicine Garden, they could already sense dangerous fluctuations, daring not to touch the illusory paradise for fear of being devoured by the ancient restrictions.</p><p>The Ancient Medicine Garden was vast. They carefully walked along its boundary, observing their surroundings, ready to avoid other cultivators if they encountered any.</p><p>After a while, Cloud Traveler finally pinpointed the location of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and found an entrance.</p><p>Cloud Traveler stood before the restriction, eyes closed, extending a hand with the Flawless Pearl concealed in his palm.</p><p>The pearl shimmered, emitting white light, as if attempting to decipher the restriction.</p><p>A moment later, Cloud Traveler opened his eyes, retreated a few steps, and said to Qin Sang, "Brother Qin, summon your Night Spectre. With it leading the way, I can focus on breaking the restriction, which will be faster."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed, patting his Corpse Puppet Pouch, from which a dark shadow emerged.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Night Spectre reappeared.</p><p>Its injuries had fully healed. With its green face, fangs, and the corpse Qi emanating from its body, it looked every bit the evil spirit. Its pitch-black eyes seemed to have gained a certain glint compared to before its injury, appearing even more eerie.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's command, the Night Spectre flashed to the front of the ancient restriction with astonishing speed.</p><p>Cloud Traveler carefully examined the Night Spectre, praising, "This corpse's power is comparable to the one in the Ice Cave. Brother Qin must have put great effort into it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded ruefully. Recalling the process, refining this Night Spectre had indeed been challenging. He had nearly failed several times and later almost lost it completely.</p><p>The Night Spectre led the way, with Qin Sang and Cloud Traveler following closely behind, forming a triangular formation. Qin Sang controlled the Night Spectre while Cloud Traveler worked on the ancient restriction.</p><p>Their strategy set, they proceeded as planned.</p><p>Cloud Traveler condensed a sharp cone of spiritual energy in his palm and abruptly struck the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>Where the cone made contact, the illusion shattered like a mirror.</p><p>The real world hidden behind the illusion was revealed.</p><p>It was a bleak and gloomy place, with withered grass, dry riverbeds, broken mountains, and no signs of life.</p><p>Forewarned by Cloud Traveler, Qin Sang immediately urged the Night Spectre forward the moment the illusion broke, with himself and Cloud Traveler close behind.</p><p>The instant they entered the Ancient Medicine Garden, a tiger's roar echoed from ahead.  Looking closely, they saw a winged tiger swooping down from the sky.</p><p>A pungent stench filled the air.</p><p>Shreds of flesh seemed to hang from its sharp fangs. The tiger's aura was incredibly ferocious, its eyes gleaming with killing intent.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen the same tiger in the illusion outside, where it had been docile, sleeping peacefully in the grass while several Nine-Colored Deer played around it.</p><p>Now, the tiger appeared before them in the flesh, its imposing presence and scent leaving no room for doubt.  If they hadn't known beforehand that it was a manifestation of the ancient restriction, it would be easy to mistake it for a real mythical beast and be terrified.</p><p>The tiger's roar shook the heavens.</p><p>With a beat of its wings, it created a gust of wind and suddenly vanished.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A loud crash followed, and two figures, one large and one small, were sent flying backward.</p><p>Despite the tiger's speed, the Night Spectre was no slouch and successfully intercepted it.</p><p>The Night Spectre steadied itself with a flicker, while the tiger tumbled several times, letting out a frustrated roar.</p><p>Clearly, the strength of the illusion was a far cry from that of a true mythical beast.</p><p>This tiger was all bark and no bite, no match for the Night Spectre.</p>
