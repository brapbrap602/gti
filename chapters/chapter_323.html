Chapter 316: Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman


If he had been still standing there, he would definitely die by the man’s sword.
The man flying on a sword had a formidable cultivation at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage!
So, Qin Sang chose to run towards Yu Daiyue instead of towards a direction with fewer people.
Qin Sang urged his Ebonywood Sword to fight off the flying sword, narrowly avoiding the siege, seeing Yu Daiyue and a young man in black suits flying towards him. Both of them were in the early-Foundation Establishment stage.
By then, Qin Sang had been struck by lightning, causing him to become blackened all over, his skin and flesh peeling off. He was pale and short-breathed, looking badly injured, but his eyes were unusually bright, looking deadly at Yu Daiyue.
As if questioning...
Why?
Yu Daiyue’s eyes dodged, somewhat unable to bear it all. “Junior Brother Qin, hand over the treasure that you got in the Corpse Cave and I promise I’ll give you a quick death!”
Corpse Cave?
Aside from the Corpse Order, what other treasures did I get? Why don’t I know about it?
This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, but he did not stop. As if he didn’t hear Yu Daiyue’s words at all, he suddenly raised his palm, revealing the yin-yang compass in his hand. The compass was aimed right at the two of them, with the yin-yang fish spinning rapidly in the center, emitting a faint glow.
Yu Daiyue and the young man in the suit were shocked. Qin Sang’s cultivation base was one level above theirs. Even if he was seriously injured, they would not dare to be careless.
Otherwise, even if a trapped animal fought back, they might end up getting killed by him when he fought to the death.
Now that Qin Sang was heavily injured by the spirit talisman, everyone just needed to slowly wear him out, since he would surely be captured. No one wanted to risk their lives by fighting, and upon seeing the black light from the compass, they all defended themselves by each sacrificing their own magic tools.
A rod-shaped octahedron mirror was in Yu Daiyue’s hand, while the young man’s magic tool was a seven-colored umbrella.
Upon seeing the black light, the young man’s expression changed slightly, and with a “whoosh,” he opened the seven-colored umbrella, protecting himself.
Since Yu Daiyue had never seen Qin Sang’s yin-yang compass before, he also did not dare to take it lightly. His treasure mirror shone, not waiting to fight back but instead protecting him just like the young man.
The next moment, the black light arrived.
“Bang!”
The black light was not able to pierce through the seven-colored umbrella and the octahedron mirror, but the strong repulsive force from it was out of the young man’s and Yu Daiyue’s expectations.
The two of them flew out unsteadily, as if they were forced back, revealing a small gap in the tight blockade.
At the same time, Qin Sang took a deep breath, his face flushed. He followed right behind the black light, seized the opportunity, and escaped death.
He seemed to have exhausted all of his strength and grabbed the opportunity to escape, not even bothering to take back his Ebonywood Sword.
It seemed that, for the sake of his life, Qin Sang was willing to abandon his life-bound spirit sword.
“Quickly! Don’t let him get away!”
Yu Daiyue and the young man hurriedly got rid of the black light and stabilized themselves, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang. They were anxious and shouted.
The mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator looked to be around forty or fifty years old. He had gloomy eyes and a long, thin scar on his face. No one knew if the scar was intentional or not, but it looked extremely fierce.
When the scar-faced man’s sword strike failed, he saw Qin Sang breaking free before he could arrive. He frowned, snorted, and cursed under his breath, calling him trash.
“You’ve been injured by my Thunder Rune. Let’s see where you can run to!”
The scar-faced man sneered. He immediately called back his flying sword, then flew up, his sword light shining and chasing after them at a speed faster than Qin Sang’s escape technique.
Unexpectedly, just when it seemed that Qin Sang was about to pass through the blockade by Yu Daiyue and the young man, he suddenly stopped unbelievably.
He turned around to face the scar-faced man chasing after him!
Right after, a desolate dragon’s roar shocked everyone present. Amid the six pairs of shocked eyes, a dragon spirit flew out of Qin Sang’s Qi Sea, roaring as it soared into the sky.
With the dragon wrapped around him, Qin Sang left behind an afterimage and flew out like a bolt of lightning. At a speed that was beyond everyone’s imagination, he instantly appeared in front of the scar-faced man.
During the past three years, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman had been kept warm, the cracks had completely disappeared, and the dragon essence had recovered to its peak. When Qin Sang drove the talisman, his speed was not slower than the cloud wanderer’s spirit bamboo ship, with its speed being comparable to the late-Foundation Establishment stage.
With the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman in action, as long as Qin Sang wanted to escape, they would definitely not be able to stop him.
But after breaking out of the siege, he only had two choices:
One was to admit defeat and outright escape, and then he could slowly deal with Yu Daiyue himself or report him to the sect.

However, the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Amulet also exposed itself at the same time. Even if Yu Daiyue and the other two did not recognize it on the spot, they would be able to find some clues if they investigated it wholeheartedly, which would lead to a deadly danger to him.

Secondly, like when he killed Luoxing Nan, he ran away, pretended to be exhausted, and then secretly urged the Talisman Treasures or the Ten Directions Yama Array.

But the current situation was completely different from those two times!

Previously, he had only been in the Foundation Stage Initial Level and Luoxing Nan had relied on the Talisman Treasure to be arrogant and fearless of the Ruyi Talisman Treasure. Furthermore, he was alone and he had the assistance of Shangguan Lifeng.

This time, the situation was completely reversed. He was alone but the other side had three people who were at their peak and who could support each other. Once they formed a complete array, even the Ten Directions Yama Banner would not necessarily be able to kill all three of them.

Furthermore, Yu Daiyue knew that he had a Talisman Treasure, so he would definitely be very cautious and would not let him succeed effortlessly with a sneak attack.

Therefore, the moment the abnormality happened, Qin Sang made a decision. Now, while the three of them were separated and on different sides, it should be his best chance.

The first person Qin Sang chose to attack was not Yu Daiyue nor the young man in tight clothes but the only Foundation Stage Intermediate Level Cultivator.

This was because he only had one chance. The Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Amulet and Yin-Yang Compass would be difficult to reuse to achieve such a strange effect once they were revealed.

The best way to capture a thief is to capture their leader!

As long as he kills this person, the situation can be reversed. The other two are not a cause for concern.

At this moment, Yu Daiyue and the other two saw that Qin Sang’s injuries did not seem to be as serious as they appeared. At that time, Qin Sang was enveloped in a beam of light, and the three people did not see the Corpse Fiend being used as a scapegoat.

The person who was the most shocked was the scarred-face man. The moment Qin Sang turned, he felt something was wrong and his intuition flashed with a warning. However, he had not expected that Qin Sang’s speed would be so fast.

In a split second, the scarred-face man only saw a blur before Qin Sang suddenly moved closer to him at an incredible speed.

The scarred-face man was in the midst of pursuing him with all his might, and he wanted to stop the Escape Light and retreat. However, he could not do it right away. Making matters worse, Qin Sang flipped the Yin-Yang Compass in his hand.

A white light suddenly appeared.

The scarred-faced man felt an enormous suction force on him, and he could not escape. Not only could he not stop, but he also accelerated.

The distance between the two quickly shortened. Qin Sang’s face was right before his eyes, and his ice-cold gaze seemed to pierce straight through to his heart.

Under these circumstances, after a brief moment of panic, the expression on the scarred-face man’s face twisted and became increasingly ferocious.
