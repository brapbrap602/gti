<h1>Chapter 1735: White Pieces</h1><p>Everyone flew and talked at the same time.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren, along with the cultivators of the Lan Dou Sect, flew with them, the spirit bird obediently following behind.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren continued to marvel, “Daoist Qin’s concealment technique is truly remarkable. I wonder which sect or school you learned it from?”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at Qin Sang, noticing he seemed lost in thought, without any intention of concealing his identity. He then secretly transmitted a message to Bai Lu Zhenren, offering a word of caution.</p><p>He had a good relationship with Bai Lu Zhenren and didn't want to see him inadvertently offend the True Monarch due to ignorance.  Besides, Qin Sang would have to reveal himself on Tianxing Island anyway.</p><p>A simple sentence, yet it struck Bai Lu Zhenren like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren was shocked.</p><p>Other Lan Dou Sect disciples, witnessing their usually calm sect leader showing such an expression, were both surprised and suspicious.</p><p>“Greetings, junior…”</p><p>After all, he was the head of a sect. Bai Lu Zhenren quickly composed himself and hastily bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to prevent Bai Lu Zhenren from bowing, and said to Bao Zhengnan and the other two, “I’ve just remembered something I need to attend to. I must leave for a few days and will be unable to continue traveling with you all.”</p><p>Bao Xi asked in surprise, “Daoist Qin, what urgent matter requires your attention? Perhaps a Si Sheng Palace disciple could assist?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, “This is a private matter, it's not something I can ask others to handle.  Please rest assured, Daoist friend, I will return soon and will not delay the main mission.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s determination, Bao Zhengnan and the other two did not say anything more. They figured that with Qin Sang's cultivation, he could freely travel anywhere in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at Bai Lu Zhenren, recalling Qin Sang’s unusually warm greeting upon meeting him, and vaguely guessed the reason.</p><p>Sure enough, he then heard Qin Sang say to Bai Lu Zhenren, "Sect Leader Bai Lu, I wish to visit Grand Elder Yang. Could you kindly introduce me?”</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren had no reason to refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a formal bow, and together with Bai Lu Zhenren, they soared into the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>After bidding farewell to everyone, Qin Sang and Bai Lu Zhenren headed northwest.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t need Bai Lu Zhenren to guide him; he still remembered the location of Lan Dou Island.</p><p>Seeing Bai Lu Zhenren’s nervous demeanor, Qin Sang initiated a conversation, chatting with him and learning about the changes on Lan Dou Island over the years.</p><p>When the Yao Hai demons invaded the Canglang Sea, they brought chaos to the region. A combined human and witch force stationed itself on Tianxing Island, fighting desperately against the invaders.</p><p>The major islands in the eastern sea were mostly occupied by demons, their appearance completely changed, and cultivators were displaced.</p><p>Lan Dou Island, protected by the Lan Dou Sect, had the strength to resist the demon incursions. The island's landscape remained largely unchanged from when Qin Sang last visited, but much had changed over the centuries.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had used the "Seed Yuan Magic Fetus" technique to create a clone, nearly becoming a disciple of a sect called Yan Miao Pavilion. That sect no longer existed.</p><p>It was said that Yan Miao Pavilion suffered heavy casualties in a demon uprising, unable to maintain their mountain gate. The Lan Dou Sect stepped in, merging Yan Miao Pavilion with another severely damaged sect, renaming the combined sect Yan Yun Lake.</p><p>He thus learned about the whereabouts of an old acquaintance.</p><p>His clone, when he joined Lan Dou Sect, had befriended a female cultivator named Fang Ting.  This woman was extremely talented, living up to expectations, and had already reached the Yuan Ying stage of cultivation. Yan Yun Lake was flourishing under her leadership, though she had not changed the sect's name back to Yan Miao Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fly directly to Lan Dou Island, instead going to Dongming Island nearby first.</p><p>Half of a star platform was originally stored in the Thunder Pool of Dongming Island. Back then, the Black Snake Mountain cultivators caused a great disturbance on Dongming Island, and Qin Sang seized the opportunity to steal the star platform.</p><p>The aftershocks of that incident still lingered. The Thunder Pool erupted, nearly destroying Dongming Island.</p><p>Afterward, the island's spiritual veins were severely damaged, reducing it to a medicinal field for cultivating inferior spirit herbs. Today, only a small number of Lan Dou Sect disciples, who had heard from their masters, knew that this inconspicuous island was once a sacred island jointly managed by various sects, holding a prominent position.</p><p>Qin Sang entered Dongming Island and easily found a huge sinkhole, bottomless, appearing to an uninformed observer like the result of a subterranean magma eruption.</p><p>All traces of the explosion had been erased. Qin Sang swept his divine sense several times but found no valuable information.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren, not understanding, cautiously asked, "True Monarch, what are you looking for?"</p><p>“This island originally had a Thunder Pool. Within the Thunder Pool, there was a stone platform. Your sect should have obtained a secret technique from there, called the 'Control Thunder Technique'..."</p><p>Qin Sang revealed the secrets of six hundred years ago, as if he were an eyewitness.</p><p>His tone was calm, but Bai Lu Zhenren's expression changed several times, his eyes filled with surprise and uncertainty.  “Why does True Monarch know our sect’s secrets so well?”</p><p>“That stone platform is now in my possession.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, without explaining the stone platform's origin.  "Besides the *Yi Lei Shu* (Thunder Control Technique), did your sect find anything else in the Lei Chi (Thunder Pool)?"</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren's mind raced with speculation. He shook his head.  "Only that secret technique. It caused great calamity within the sect. Since True Monarch knows of the *Yi Lei Shu*, you must also know of the incident at Dou Niu Peak.  The technique has been sealed away ever since.  True Monarch, if you're interested, I'll send it to you upon your return to your mountain..."</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at Lan Dou Island and flew directly towards the Lan Dou Gate.</p><p>Familiar sights filled their eyes, stirring up old memories.</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren invited Qin Sang to sit in the Headmaster's Hall, instructing a disciple to serve tea while he went to summon his junior brother, Yang.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the spiritual tea, took a sip, and sensed two approaching auras.  Soon, Bai Lu Zhenren and a thin Daoist entered.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized the thin Daoist as the former acolyte of Old Daoist Hua Yang.  Years had passed, and the man was now a Yuan Ying cultivator, his bearing and demeanor greatly changed, though his features were still vaguely recognizable.</p><p>Yang Shouzuo, clearly warned by Bai Lu Zhenren, approached with respectful haste and bowed.</p><p>"True Monarch Qin recognizes me?"</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, Yang Shouzuo was puzzled. He was certain he'd never met this person.</p><p>Qin Sang stood, brushed his hand across his face, transforming into a youthful, innocent appearance. He sighed softly. "Master Uncle Yang, do you remember disciple Zhang Yue?"</p><p>Yang Shouzuo's eyes widened, his expression frozen.</p><p>"You... you... you..."</p><p>Rarely flustered, he pointed at Qin Sang, speechless.</p><p>Over centuries, countless disciples had joined the Yin-Yang lineage, but Yang Shouzuo always remembered this one. Zhang Yue, a child with four innate spiritual roots, deemed hopeless by others, yet exceptionally talented in the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*, had been accepted as a true disciple.  Yang Shouzuo had personally presided over his initiation ceremony; Zhang Yue was his very first true disciple.</p><p>After the great upheaval, Zhang Yue disappeared, a loss Yang Shouzuo deeply regretted. The sect suspected him and investigated thoroughly, but the matter remained unresolved.</p><p>A flash of light, and Qin Sang resumed his original appearance. He turned to the stunned Bai Lu Zhenren. "I have something I wish to discuss with Shouzuo Yang."</p><p>Bai Lu Zhenren finally snapped out of it and discreetly withdrew, handing Qin Sang a jade slip before leaving.</p><p>A scan of the slip revealed the *Yi Lei Shu*, identical to the one he already possessed.  The once powerful thunder technique had become too slow for him.</p><p>It seemed Lan Dou Gate was unaware. To uncover the stone platform's origin, he'd have to go to the Wu Shen Continent.</p><p>Casually putting away the jade slip, Qin Sang took the initiative. "Zhang Yue was me, but I am not Zhang Yue.  Shouzuo Yang, I owe you a debt of teaching."</p><p>Yang Shouzuo sat down, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang. He vaguely guessed the truth about those years, yet it was difficult to accept—his former disciple had become a formidable Transformation Stage cultivator!</p><p>Regardless of Yang Shouzuo's reaction, Qin Sang produced an item. "Shouzuo Yang, please examine this jade."</p><p>He brought out a jade piece.</p><p>The moment Yang Shouzuo saw the jade, he felt a connection and showed surprise.</p><p>"I obtained this jade unexpectedly.  Without my cultivation of the Yin-Yang Armor, I would have missed it. Unfortunately, it holds no power for me. Shouzuo Yang, can you discern anything unusual about it?"</p><p>He handed the jade to Yang Shouzuo.</p><p>Yang Shouzuo hesitated slightly, took the jade, examined it, apologized, and closed his eyes, quietly circulating his cultivation.</p><p>The next moment, Yang Shouzuo's aura shifted dramatically; the Yin and Yang energies within him surged.</p><p>To Qin Sang, Yang Shouzuo and the area around him within a zhang seemed to split into Yin and Yang, a fascinating sight.</p><p>Yin and Yang energies gathered in his palm, distinct black and white, supporting the jade and subtly seeping into it.</p><p>Disappointingly, no matter how much Yin-Yang energy was infused, it was like a stone dropped into the sea; the jade remained unresponsive.</p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time.</p><p>Yang Shouzuo stopped, and laughed bitterly. "I can sense this jade is deeply connected to our sect's techniques, but no matter what I do, I can't discern its mysteries.  True Monarch, you should remember that the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique* originally only had one layer. Our ancestor, Yin-Yang Daoist, enlightened the Yin-Yang Dao and continued the technique, giving rise to our Yin-Yang lineage.  But the additions made by our successors, while not entirely wrong, are certainly vastly different."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>Yang Shouzuo looked at the jade, somewhat reluctantly. "From my perception, I only understand a bit more than True Monarch. The mystery lies within the jade's core. If one cultivates the true *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*, one may be able to comprehend this jade's power from there."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said, "Master Yang, might I have a look at your cultivation technique?"</p><p>It was a somewhat excessive request to view someone else's secret teachings.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Yang readily agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Master Yang flicked his finger, sending a stream of light towards Qin Sang.  His expression held a hint of anticipation. "Our ancestor, Yin-Yang Daoist, was incredibly talented. He refined the incomplete scripture, reaching the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage, yet he ultimately could not break through, remaining at that level his entire life.  His successors have been unable to achieve the same, leaving the later stages of the cultivation a blank, and moreover..."</p><p>Master Yang looked ashamed. "We lack the ancestor's talent. After forming the Yuan Ying, we find the cultivation increasingly difficult, even reaching the mid-stage being exceptionally hard. It must be a flaw in the technique. However, refining the technique is no easy feat. I myself don't have that capability, and nor do other Yuan Ying cultivators.  A True Monarch, with their profound abilities, might be able to..."</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang expectantly.  Finding a Transcendence cultivator wasn't easy, and it was rare for someone like Qin Sang to be interested in this particular technique.</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense delved into the stream of light. The complete "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" appeared in his mind.</p><p>Master Yang continuously explained, helping him comprehend it.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, it was difficult to fully grasp it in such a short time.  But Qin Sang's path of cultivation differed from others, and he actually saw something, lightly exclaiming, "This shouldn't be a purely spiritual cultivation technique."</p><p>Master Yang's eyes lit up. He bowed slightly, his face full of admiration. "True Monarch's insight is unparalleled. Our ancestor had the same thought, but unfortunately, he lacked the ability to do anything about it."</p><p>The first layer of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" was complete.</p><p>Based on this, Yin-Yang Daoist developed a technique to cultivate spiritual energy through the absorption and expulsion of Yin and Yang energy.</p><p>But don't forget, the first step of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" is to refine the Yin-Yang armor within the primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation encompassed physical, spiritual, and mental aspects. He perceived the subtleties within; the original technique was absolutely not a purely spiritual cultivation method. It was likely a dual cultivation of spiritual and physical energy, a mutual verification of Yin and Yang, or even more complex.</p><p>Ghost Mother once said that cultivators can be broadly divided into three categories based on the cultivation of physical, spiritual, and mental energy, but there are also those who do not fall into these three categories, or who integrate them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to make changes to the original technique. Yin-Yang Daoist's refinement was purely a path of spiritual energy cultivation, and he could still discern some principles.</p><p>After an hour, Qin Sang withdrew his mind and pointed out a place that needed improvement, much to Master Yang's delight.</p><p>Seeing Master Yang's joyful expression, Qin Sang suddenly said, "When Yin-Yang Daoist obtained the technique, were there any other objects nearby?"</p><p>Master Yang's pupils constricted, his smile fading.</p><p>Yin-Yang Daoist never explained how he obtained the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," but he left behind a treasure related to the technique, mentioning that he relied on this treasure to comprehend the later stages of the technique. Unfortunately, he never fully understood the treasure's mysteries; it only served as guidance before the Golden Core stage.  The techniques beyond the Yuan Ying stage were entirely deduced by Yin-Yang Daoist himself.</p><p>That treasure was a white chess piece.</p><p>He was secretly startled. He knew Transcendence cultivators had immense power, but he didn't expect them to guess it just from the technique itself.</p><p>After some hesitation, Master Yang dared not hide it. "Yes! But like the Jade of Humble Virtue, this object conceals its nature, and none of our ancestors have been able to fathom its mysteries.  Yin-Yang Daoist also only grasped a superficial understanding."</p><p>He took out the white chess piece.</p><p>The piece was pure white, with a smooth luster, indistinguishable from ordinary chess pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his hand, feeling a slight chill.  Following Master Yang's instructions, he used his spiritual sense to investigate the chess piece, activating a faint white light, but that was all. It didn't reveal any further wonders in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Master Yang gritted his teeth. "If True Monarch can help our Yin-Yang lineage complete the technique, I am willing to give this treasure to you!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him and shook his head slightly. "I can help you improve the existing parts, but completing the technique is extremely difficult.  Unless I cultivate the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" myself, it would require immense effort and might not even succeed."</p><p>He had too many things to do and couldn't be distracted.</p><p>Master Yang's face showed disappointment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang's tone changed. "You can try to comprehend it yourselves.  Ancestor Yin-Yang Daoist's approach was too extreme; the cultivation will affect your primordial spirit, which is one of the reasons why you feel the cultivation is so difficult.  I will help you improve the technique and give you something else that should provide you with a chance to break through…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a piece of Soul-Calming Incense and gave him the formula as well.</p><p>Even if given the superior Soul-Calming Incense formula, the Yin-Yang lineage would still not have the ability to refine it, making this gift even more valuable.</p><p>Of course, he was going to take the white chess piece.</p><p>Qin Sang held the white chess piece in his right hand and the Soul-Calming Incense and its formula in his left.</p><p>Master Yang smelled the incense and felt his mind clear, greatly surprised.  He looked back and forth, weighing his options for a long time before finally deciding to accept the incense and the formula.</p><p>With this formula, even if he couldn't do it, future generations would have a great chance.</p><p>"Comprehending the technique will still take some time. Master Yang, why don't you come with me to Tianxing Island to exchange ideas?"  Qin Sang suggested.</p><p>Master Yang had no objections.</p><p>Soon, the three of them flew out of Lán Dòu Island.</p><p>(End)</p>
