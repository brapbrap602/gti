<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1314: A Rare Artifact</p><p>"During this period, all of you must work together and prepare diligently. Once we return from the Purple Palace, it will be time for the grand ceremony. I will invite fellow cultivators from all over to witness the event. Do not let the reputation of the Azure Goat Temple falter," Qin Sang said with a gentle smile.</p><p>In his heart, however, he knew that the newly established Azure Goat Temple was still too weak. The number of disciples and their cultivation levels were far from comparable to those of other sects. Qin Sang had decided that it was better to have fewer disciples of higher quality than to accept mediocrity.</p><p>Li Yufu, leveraging Qin Sang's reputation, had recruited many new disciples, including a few Golden Core stage rogue cultivators. However, they were still under observation and could not yet be entrusted with important tasks.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's words, everyone smiled with joy but also felt the weight of their responsibilities. Qin Sang's fame had spread throughout the North Star Realm. When the time came, most Nascent Soul cultivators from the realm would likely attend the ceremony. They could not afford to make a fool of themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang then took out a jade slip.</p><p>"Yufu, prioritize the mining of these spirit veins," he instructed.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planned to delve deeper into the art of artifact crafting, which would require a vast amount of spiritual materials for practice. These minor tasks could be handled by the younger disciples, sparing him the trouble.</p><p>Afterward, Li Yufu and the others took their leave, but Shangguan Lifeng stayed behind.</p><p>"Master, I have made up my mind. I wish to walk the path of slaughter! From now on, I will abandon the blade and cultivate the sword!" Shangguan Lifeng declared, removing the long blade from his back with a resolute expression.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his gaze fixed on Shangguan Lifeng's eyes.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng met Qin Sang's gaze without fear, his eyes filled with unwavering determination.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>"Very well. I shall now pass on to you the *Bamboo Sword Scripture*!"</p><p>...</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang brought Shangguan Lifeng to the tomb of the Bamboo Sword Master.</p><p>"Senior Bamboo showed me great kindness, and I have no way to repay him. The *Bamboo Sword Scripture* is his final masterpiece. Unfortunately, I could only grasp the sword's intent and not fully cultivate the scripture, making me but a half-successor. From this day forward, I shall act as his proxy and pass the *Bamboo Sword Scripture* on to you," Qin Sang said solemnly, standing before the tomb with incense smoke curling upward.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng stepped forward, his expression grave, and knelt before the tomb, kowtowing respectfully.</p><p>"Disciple Shangguan Lifeng pays homage to my master! Thank you, Master Qin, for passing on this art!"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke softly, "By cultivating the *Bamboo Sword Scripture*, you become the successor of Senior Bamboo. Since we are old acquaintances, from now on, we shall address each other as equals. Call me senior brother."</p><p>"This..." Shangguan Lifeng hesitated, feeling it was improper to overstep. After a moment of deliberation, he said, "Junior Brother pays respects to Senior Brother Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang patted Shangguan Lifeng's shoulder.</p><p>He did not like to determine seniority based on cultivation level. In the future, the rules of the Azure Goat Temple would not be as rigid as those of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>"This sword scripture embodies the lifelong efforts of Senior Bamboo. He was a genius of unparalleled talent, but his fate was tragic, and he met an untimely end. It is a great loss, for the North Star Realm could have soon gained another great cultivator," Qin Sang lamented. He held deep admiration for Senior Bamboo, and every time he thought of the peach blossom in the Nether Valley, he could not help but sigh in sorrow.</p><p>"You are the first to cultivate the *Bamboo Sword Scripture* and will henceforth be the head of the sword cultivation lineage in the Azure Goat Temple. I hope you will remain true to your heart and not betray the efforts of our predecessor," Qin Sang said earnestly as he handed the scripture to Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng knelt on both knees, raising the scripture above his head with both hands. He kowtowed once more before the tomb of Senior Bamboo, swearing to dedicate his life to the path of the sword.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subtly. "Rise. We have a senior sister, the daughter of Senior Bamboo. I will introduce you to her when the opportunity arises. Since you have suddenly abandoned the blade for the sword, you will undoubtedly face many challenges. Do not rush into seclusion. First, go to Yufu and find a spiritual sword that suits you. While you're at it, recruit a few promising sword cultivators. Gain some experience outside, and when you return, you will have a deeper understanding of the scripture."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>A few days after Shangguan Lifeng left, Qing Jun returned.</p><p>During these days, Qin Sang had been engraving puppet seals on the Nascent Soul puppet but had encountered difficulties. He quickly emerged from seclusion to seek Qing Jun's guidance.</p><p>In the stone pavilion, the two sat facing each other. The Azure Luan puppet, now shrunk in size, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, showing a surprising affection for him. To an outsider, it might seem as though Qin Sang were the puppet's master.</p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew out on its own.</p><p>The phoenix and the butterfly played together, frolicking in the air.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet stood to the side as Qing Jun raised her hand and pressed it lightly in the air.</p><p>In the next moment, the puppet's body shone with light. Both talisman seals and puppet seals appeared within it, colliding and entangling with each other as if trying to devour one another, creating a chaotic mess.</p><p>The puppet's face showed signs of struggle, its eyes turning blood-red.</p><p>"The problem is not serious. I overlooked some key points earlier. A few adjustments will suffice," Qing Jun said calmly, her jade-like fingers flicking rapidly as streams of light entered the puppet's body.</p><p>Soon, the puppet seals calmed down, and the talisman seals ceased their aggression. The two forces coexisted peacefully. One by one, the talisman seals were transformed into puppet seals, a process Qing Jun accomplished far more swiftly than Qin Sang could.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang relaxed, leaning back in his wooden chair. He sipped leisurely on a cup of peach blossom wine brewed by his senior sister, watching the Azure Luan and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly play with unprecedented contentment.</p><p>"Senior Sister, what happened earlier? Do you need assistance? I plan to visit the Void Spirit Sect in a few days to seek Bing Han's guidance on artifact crafting. I may stay there for some time," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Qing Jun replied, "It's nothing serious. I still need to verify a few things. You may focus on your own affairs. Bing Han is quite cunning. It won't be easy to get her to share the Void Spirit Sect's legacy. Be careful not to fall into her schemes."</p><p>Just then, a whooshing sound echoed through the valley.</p><p>Bai had emerged from seclusion. In a few flashes, his figure appeared, and before he even arrived, he spoke rapidly, "My cultivation has stabilized. I need to harness the Earth Fiend Qi to further my training. I aim to improve my cultivation as much as possible before the Purple Palace emerges. Brother Qin, where is the Earth Sink Cave you mentioned before?"</p><p>Bai appeared before the stone pavilion and, upon seeing Qing Jun, seemed somewhat wary. He straightened his expression and cupped his hands in greeting. "Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qing Jun."</p><p>Then, Bai's gaze shifted to the Nascent Soul puppet before Qing Jun.</p><p>"The Earth Sink Cave is near Mount Shaohua, guarded only by Qi Refining stage disciples. As long as you don't cause a commotion, there's no need to worry about Dongyang Bo discovering you..." Qin Sang said, sipping his peach blossom wine. Suddenly, he noticed something off about Bai's aura.</p><p>He turned to see Bai staring blankly at the Nascent Soul puppet, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p>"Brother Bai..." Qin Sang called out, puzzled.</p><p>"This thing..." Bai pointed at the puppet, his voice trembling. "Where did you get this?"</p><p>It was then that Qin Sang remembered Bai had never seen the Nascent Soul puppet before. Judging by his reaction, could there be some secret about the puppet?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he sat up straight.</p><p>Qing Jun also looked surprised and stopped her technique.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged glances. "This is a Nascent Soul puppet inherited from the Upper Primordial Tranquil Palace. Not long ago, at the Blood Lake, Dongyang Bo schemed against Gong Liangyu, and I happened to seize it. I hadn't mentioned it to you before... Do you recognize this, Brother Bai?"</p>
