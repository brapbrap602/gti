<h1>Chapter 792: Revenge</h1><p>Chapter 792: Revenge</p><p>Hearing Madam Liu’s shout, Cui Ji immediately went on alert, erring on the side of caution.</p><p>He didn’t stop pursuing Madam Liu, however.  His flying daggers, combined with the Zi You Pearl, launched a relentless attack, overwhelming Madam Liu and pushing her towards defeat.</p><p>“Master Qingfeng!”</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, two exclamations ringing out simultaneously.</p><p>One was a joyful surprise, the other disbelief.</p><p>Cui Ji looked as if he’d seen a ghost.</p><p>He had witnessed Qin Sang’s magical weapon destroyed, severely injured, and surrounded by ferocious beasts—impossible to survive. Yet here Qin Sang was, standing before him.</p><p>Madam Liu recalled Qin Sang’s conflict with Cui Ji.  Seeing Cui Ji’s expression, she immediately realized Qin Sang’s disappearance in the Purple Mist Wasteland must have been suspicious, something they didn’t know.</p><p>“Master… ”</p><p>In that instant, Madam Liu guessed much, her face alight with ecstatic joy.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, interrupting Madam Liu, his tone calm.  “Thanks to Daoist Cui’s generosity, this humble cultivator nearly perished in the Purple Mist Wasteland.  However, my luck held, and I managed to escape. Madam Liu, since you’re also here for revenge, let’s join forces and kill this man first…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang pointed his sword at Cui Ji.  The ebony sword flashed, bypassing Madam Liu, and struck towards Cui Ji.</p><p>In his eyes, Cui Ji was already a dead man; he didn’t bother with pleasantries.</p><p>Madam Liu understood perfectly, hope ignited in her eyes.  She stopped running, hastily producing a bell—the same magical weapon used by the Liu cultivator earlier.</p><p>Seeing the bell, Madam Liu’s face filled with sorrow, deepening her hatred for Cui Ji.</p><p>A fierce look flashed across Madam Liu’s face. She poured all her spiritual energy into the bell without reservation.</p><p>The bell trembled slightly in her hand, its sound crisp and clear. Circular sound waves dispersed, targeting Cui Ji’s flying daggers.</p><p>These were clearly not ordinary sound waves; the ripples shone with a dazzling red light, like fiery rings solidifying into tangible objects.</p><p>The fiery rings radiated intense heat, containing abundant fire elemental power.  As they spread, a firestorm raged across dozens of meters.</p><p>The flying daggers were caught off guard and enveloped by the sound waves.</p><p>Cui Ji’s expression changed.  The moment he saw Qin Sang, he sensed danger and hastily recalled his daggers.</p><p>Silver light surged; the daggers slashed out incredibly sharp blade-energy.</p><p>But this bell was no ordinary magical weapon.  Even though Madam Liu’s cultivation was inferior, her full-power activation of the bell could temporarily restrain the daggers.</p><p>Madam Liu desperately entangled the daggers, buying Qin Sang time.</p><p>She was gambling. During their first encounter, Cui Ji had been on the verge of a breakthrough, yet seemed extremely wary of Qin Sang, indicating Qin Sang’s strength far exceeded appearances.</p><p>The astonishing power of the ebony sword further confirmed her guess.</p><p>Now, the ebony sword was before Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji still intended to utter a few threats, but Qin Sang and Madam Liu's instantaneous coordination caught him off guard, turning to attack him.  The situation became instantly tense.</p><p>His cultivation had greatly improved; although facing a two-pronged attack, he wasn’t panicked and believed he had a high chance of winning.  His only concern was Qin Sang’s ability to defile magical weapons.</p><p>Cui Ji maneuvered his daggers to break free while using the Zi You Pearl to intercept the ebony sword.</p><p>But as soon as they clashed, Cui Ji’s face changed.</p><p>The ebony sword and the Zi You Pearl clashed directly, weaving through countless purple rays, sometimes like a tiger roaring through mountains and forests, sometimes like a gentle breeze—unpredictable.</p><p>The attack never slowed, relentless and all-encompassing. Cui Ji felt suffocated.</p><p>Before, he knew Qin Sang was skilled in swordsmanship, but he had never displayed such oppressive sword techniques.  A single flying sword inexplicably instilled a chill in his heart.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t been able to do this before; his so-called swordsmanship was merely the empty shell granted by his cultivation techniques. Only now was he a true sword cultivator.</p><p>Strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>Qin Sang gave Cui Ji no chance to breathe, flashing forward. With a forceful flick of his palm, the Ten Directions Yama Banner spun out, simultaneously, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire surged towards Cui Ji in a terrifying display.</p><p>The daggers finally broke free from the bell’s constraint. Though worried about his daggers being defiled, Cui Ji couldn't afford to hesitate and used them to block the demon fire.</p><p>The power Qin Sang displayed terrified him; he felt a surge of the urge to flee.</p><p>Madam Liu failed to stop the daggers. Seeing Cui Ji’s actions, she became anxious and swiftly approached.</p><p>“Master, don't let the villain escape…”</p><p>Before Madam Liu finished, a deafening beast roar echoed.</p><p>She was astonished to find a beast’s shadow emerging from the demonic flames.  Taking advantage of the moment when the demonic fire and the flying daggers were locked in combat, the beast, incredibly ferocious, lunged at Cui Jizhen.</p><p>The beast’s shadow moved with incredible speed. The instant it pounced, it split into several forms, surrounding and attacking Cui Ji, making it impossible to distinguish the real from the false.</p><p>“A spirit beast at the Yao Dan stage!”</p><p>Cui Ji was terrified.  At this point, Cui Ji thought he finally understood how Qin Sang had survived—he had a spirit beast of such formidable power, yet he had never revealed it.</p><p>Cui Ji had lost all will to fight, but the situation was clearly beyond his control.  While Cui Ji frantically dealt with the two-headed… [creature’s name],  he received assistance from Lady Liu. Qin Sang, focused on swordsmanship, forced back the Purple Haze, his flying sword like a rainbow piercing the sun, easily breaking through Cui Ji's protective true energy.</p><p>Cui Ji's face was filled with terror. In desperation, he used the Zi You Pearl in a violent collision.  The pearl's body seemed remarkably fragile; colliding directly with the ebony sword, its luster immediately dimmed, and Cui Ji’s face went pale.</p><p>The ebony sword was knocked off course, but a ray of sword light still successfully struck Cui Ji.</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>Cui Ji screamed, his face ashen.  The cumulative injuries sealed Cui Ji's fate.  The flying dagger momentarily stalled, giving Qin Sang the opportunity to gather the demonic fire and knock it away. Then, he used his magical weapon in tandem with the two-headed… [creature’s name], ruthlessly killing Cui Ji.</p><p>Seeing her revenge within reach, Lady Liu fought even more fiercely, her eyes bloodshot, acting almost deranged, causing Qin Sang to stare in astonishment.</p><p>Finally, Cui Ji let out a desperate cry as a flying sword pierced his heart, killing him.</p><p>Qin Sang took a spirit pill to restore his true energy.  His dantian felt empty; the consecutive battles, while constantly suppressing Cui Ji, had taken a great toll, yet he felt exhilarated.</p><p>Having decisively killed Cui Ji unscathed, the breakthrough in his swordsmanship had significantly increased his strength. After some time to hone his skills, he would be able to face Cui Ji fearlessly with his swordsmanship alone.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, and he stood beside Cui Ji’s corpse, unceremoniously looting his belongings and pocketing them.</p><p>Cui Ji died with his eyes wide open, having just broken through his bottleneck only to meet his death.</p><p>As Qin Sang examined his spoils of war, Lady Liu stared blankly, silent.</p><p>Turning around, Qin Sang saw Lady Liu weeping, her expression a stark contrast to her previous frenzy. Cui Ji’s chest and abdomen were mangled, almost entirely the work of Lady Liu. His innards, mixed with blood, lay scattered on the ground, the smell of blood pungent.</p>
