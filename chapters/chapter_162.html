<h1>**Chapter 155: Divine Consciousness**</h1><p>**Chapter 155: Divine Consciousness**</p><p>As he entered the Ghostly Wind Barrier, the Skyfall Tear barrier completely enveloped Qin Sang. Qin Sang only felt his body lighten as he was blasted back by a gale. Immediately after, several more violent winds converged from all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang felt like he had become a piece of meat on a chopping board as heavy blows rained down on him from all sides. The Skyfall Tear barrier was torn to shreds.</p><p>*Bam!*</p><p>Qin Sang was slammed into a cliff face. Before he could even feel the pain, he was yanked back up and thrown towards another cliff face. He was battered and tossed about at the mercy of the raging wind.</p><p>At the same time, a piercing demonic sound flooded his mind, its sinister undulations assailing his Nascent Soul. Qin Sang was able to completely resist the demonic sound thanks to the protection of the Jade Buddha, but for others without resolute willpower or effective defensive measures, the demonic sound alone could severely injure their Nascents Souls.</p><p>The howling wind also carried a bone-chilling coldness, like countless ice shards cutting into the trespassers. If they were ensnared by the demonic sound and had no energy left to activate their protective Dharma artifacts, they could easily perish in the whirlwind.</p><p>His vision spun and danced, and the figures of Qing Ting and the others disappeared from sight. As expected, they had been scattered the moment they entered the Ghostly Wind Barrier. He wondered if the Liu brothers had managed to withstand it.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Skyfall Tear at full power, causing the barrier to become more condensed and cling tightly to his body. He could barely maintain his balance in the storm before starting his descent.</p><p>The Ghostly Wind Barrier was incredibly thick. Inside, there was nothing particularly dangerous aside from the raging winds and the deafening demonic sound. Due to the unpredictable and chaotic winds, Qin Sang could only go with the flow. It took him a while to figure out the pattern and time his descents accordingly.</p><p>He continued his erratic ascent and descent, unsure of how far he had traveled, until he finally broke out of the Ghostly Wind Barrier.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin has also descended.”</p><p>As soon as he emerged from the windstorm, Qin Sang heard Yu Daiyue’s joyous voice. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that three others had safely arrived – Qing Ting, Yu Daiyue, and, to Qin Sang’s surprise, Old Man Baiyun Shan.</p><p>Old Man Baiyun Shan looked composed and nodded at him as if he had been there for quite some time.</p><p>It seemed like his unassuming sack-like Dharma artifact was quite extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts flashed, and he nonchalantly greeted the trio before moving to stand beside them. He stepped onto the solid, rocky ground and gazed around, taking in his surroundings.</p><p>He had expected the Ghostly Wind Barrier to conceal a bottomless ravine below, but unexpectedly, the barrier marked the bottom of the chasm – or rather, the second level of the canyon.</p><p>This level was even more desolate than the one above. The Ghostly Wind Barrier above them blotted out the sky, while the sides were obscured by what were likely cliffs. Not only were the sides invisible, but even the ends of the canyon were concealed by the thick Ghostly Wind Barrier.</p><p>The barrier resembled an upturned bowl, leaving only a circular area for them to stand.</p><p>However, even from outside, it was clear that the canyon became wider as it descended.</p><p>The expanse was vast indeed. It seemed as though the canyon had hollowed out both sides of the surrounding mountains, whether naturally or through human intervention.</p><p>Not a speck of life was visible. The ground was not greenish-black but pitch-black. Qin Sang reached out and touched a protruding piece of black rock. It was ice-cold to the touch – a coldness that was difficult to endure even for a cultivator. Qin Sang withdrew his hand in surprise.</p><p>They were currently standing on the edge of the circular space, and in the middle of it was a massive pool of water. The pool was filled with clear, azure water. Since there was not a trace of wind in this space, the pool was exceptionally tranquil, and one could seemingly see all the way to the bottom.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang approached the edge of the pool and looked down, he could only see an unfathomable abyss. There was not a single fish in sight.</p><p>“No wonder Junior Brother Qin was able to pass the trial of the Red Dust Calabash. After passing through the barrier, your complexion and movements remain natural, and your Nascent Soul is completely unharmed. This is not something that can be achieved solely through willpower. Junior Brother Qin’s divine consciousness must be formidable as well.” Qing Ting’s eyes sparkled with surprise. After all, she had to consume a spiritual pill to free herself from the influence of the demonic sound.</p><p>Yu Daiyue looked at Qin Sang deeply and said with a smile, “Senior Sister Qing Ting has forgotten. When Junior Brother Qin passed the Treasured Calabash Illusion, he was only at the eleventh level of Qi Condensation. Now that he has broken through to Foundation Establishment, his divine consciousness has naturally grown stronger.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Old Man Baiyun Shan glanced at Qin Sang in astonishment, his carefree expression vanishing.</p><p>Qin Sang took in the subtle changes on the three disciples' faces, and then he replied calmly, "Senior Apprentice Sister Qingting, you've flattered me. I was lucky enough to consume a Blue Dark Fruit, which has enhanced my spiritual consciousness a little bit."</p><p>The reason he didn't play up the fact that he was injured by the Demonic Resonance was partly because he had rushed out of the barrier without any warning and didn't have time to pretend, but also because while it's good to hide one's strength, it's also important to show a little bit of what you can do if it won't cause any major problems. If exploring the ruins goes smoothly and they divvy up the loot, they might not necessarily distribute it according to the agreement. In particular, if they happen to find a valuable treasure, that could potentially make them change their minds. Qin Sang didn't believe in this so-called "brotherhood of disciples." Of everyone present, Qin Sang and the Liu brothers had the lowest cultivation bases. The others didn't know that Qin Sang's foundation had been damaged, but Yu Daiyue knew, so they might easily underestimate Qin Sang. By letting them know that they shouldn't mess with him, he could save himself a lot of unnecessary trouble. As long as he didn't reveal the Jade Buddha, these people would only think that he had a strong spiritual consciousness, and wouldn't imagine that he had any way of defending against attacks that targeted his primordial spirit. Moreover, because of the constant exposure to sword qi and killing symbols while he was cultivating the "Primordial Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter," Qin Sang's spiritual consciousness was indeed stronger than that of disciples at the same level. He had thought about looking for a technique for cultivating spiritual consciousness, but these techniques were rare and the Pagoda Peak didn't have any particularly good ones. Also, his talent was too poor and he wouldn't dare to get distracted at the moment. Otherwise, his chances of reaching Golden Core Stage would become even more remote. Qingting suddenly realized what he meant and nodded her head in envy: "The Blue Dark Fruit has wonderful effects for enhancing spiritual consciousness, but it's hard to find in the current cultivation world. Junior Apprentice Brother Qin is very lucky." Qin Sang nodded, and then turned his gaze and pointed to the pool in front of them, asking, "Senior Apprentice Sister Qingting, is the formation restriction in the pool?" Unexpectedly, Qingting shook her head and replied, "It's not in the pool, the entire pool is the formation restriction. Junior Apprentice Brother Qin, if you use your spiritual consciousness to test it out, you'll understand what I mean." Qin Sang looked at the pool in surprise, then sent out a wisp of spiritual consciousness to probe the surface of the water. The previously calm pool suddenly rippled gently, and while it seemed harmless to humans and animals, it firmly blocked Qin Sang's spiritual consciousness outside the water ripple; no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't get it to penetrate even the slightest bit. Just then, the sound of a sword rang out from overhead. Qin Sang looked up and saw Li driving his sword towards them, his sharp sword qi tearing through the barrier of the Eerie Wind. They waited a bit, and Wu Yuesheng and the Liu brothers also descended one after another, which caused the group of people who had been worried the entire time to finally relax.</p>
