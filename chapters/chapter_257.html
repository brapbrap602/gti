A viscous, gelatinous fluid flowed in Old Dique's palm. But it wasn’t golden. Instead, it was the color of magma—red.</p><p>Up until now, Qin Sang hadn't smelled any spiritual fruit fragrance.</p><p>He stared at the fluid, his eyes filled with doubt. He couldn’t say why, but the drop of fluid gave him a familiar feeling. He was sure that he hadn’t seen it before. The only possibility was that he had read about something similar in ancient books.</p><p>Old Dique used his spiritual energy to envelop the fluid, suspending it in mid-air. It shone with a mesmerizing luster like jade. More surprisingly, golden light occasionally flashed within the fluid.</p><p>The golden light was so faint that one might easily overlook it without careful observation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly discovered that this golden light was extraordinary. It was like runes born from heaven and earth, something beyond human creation, exceptionally mysterious.</p><p>Could this be…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled something, his gaze tightening with astonishment.</p><p>“Crimson Fire Gold!”</p><p>Old Dique looked at the fluid in front of him with an entranced expression, murmuring its true name, confirming Qin Sang's guess.</p><p>Crimson Fire Gold.</p><p>A rare and unusual spiritual object found in heaven and earth. Its form was like liquid gold, but it was crimson in color, resembling molten fire, giving it the name Crimson Fire Gold.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang was so astonished was because he read in the records that this spiritual object was not a spiritual medicine but a material for refining weapons, and a precious material that could be used to refine magical treasures!</p><p>The ancient books clearly stated that Crimson Fire Gold was a marvelous object born in heaven and earth. How could it have grown from a vine?</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang discovered that this fluid wasn’t exactly the same as real Crimson Fire Gold. The golden light it emitted wasn’t as dense as described in the ancient books.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was racking his brains over this, Old Dique reached into his spiritual beast pouch, releasing two Fire Jade Centipedes, and separated a drop of Crimson Fire Gold in his palm.</p><p>As if they had seen exceptionally delicious food, the two centipedes rushed forward relentlessly, vying to devour it.</p><p>That drop of Crimson Fire Gold shrank at a visible speed, swallowed into the Fire Jade Centipedes' stomachs. Then, Old Dique placed his palm in front of him, looking at the Fire Jade Centipedes with expectation.</p><p>Qin Sang also focused his gaze on the Fire Jade Centipedes.</p><p>After swallowing the Crimson Fire Gold, the Fire Jade Centipedes suddenly became sluggish, their former vitality gone. Soon, their bodies underwent new changes. Tiny flames appeared at the tip of each attached paw, as if the centipedes were walking on fire. Their bodies, which resembled jade, appeared even more crystalline and translucent.</p><p>However, these flames soon extinguished, and the Fire Jade Centipedes returned to their original appearance. But Old Dique’s expression only grew more excited.</p><p>Was this…a transformation?</p><p>Qin Sang had read a lot of information on Fire Jade Centipedes since obtaining them. He knew a great deal about their habits and understood that their paws being alight with flames signified the start of their transformation!</p><p>The transformation of strange insects was similar to the breakthrough of cultivators.</p><p>With each transformation, their strength would take a qualitative leap.</p><p>However, the difficulty of transforming strange insects was extremely high, even more difficult than human cultivators breaking through!</p><p>Moreover, the conditions for transformation were different for each type of strange insect.</p><p>The Jade Beast Sect was most adept in controlling beasts. It was said that they even knew very little about the world's strange insects. Coupled with the fact that strange insects were almost extinct in the world of cultivation, no one wanted to delve into them anymore.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipedes were currently at the peak of the Mortal Demon stage, which was equivalent to the thirteenth level of Qi Refining in human cultivators. In fact, the Fire Jade Centipedes already had this strength when Qin Sang found them twenty years ago.</p><p>If one only considered strength, the Fire Jade Centipedes should have begun their transformation long ago.</p><p>They had swallowed so many Sun Stones and Fire Essence Stones over the years, yet not only had their strength not improved, they hadn’t even shown signs of transformation. This was how difficult it was for strange insects to transform.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn’t dare let the Fire Jade Centipedes transform lightly. After transformation, the strength of Fire Jade Centipedes would allow them to rival him. Without recognizing him as master, it would be very difficult to subdue them with just external restrictions.</p><p>After consuming a drop of Crimson Fire Gold, they actually showed signs of transformation! Of course, these were just signs for now. Whether they could successfully transform and how long it would take to complete the transformation were both unknown.</p><p>But this still astonished Qin Sang. He turned his gaze and stared at the fluid.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Fire Jade Centipedes' transformation was definitely due to the Crimson Vine fruit.</p><p>I wonder whether the Jade Fire Centipede could have undergone metamorphosis due to the liquid or because it had eaten enough spirit objects that after swallowing this single drop of liquid, quantitative change led to qualitative change and it transformed.</p><p>Ground-Scar Senior started laughing out of a sudden.</p><p>“Hahaha…… That’s really what happened! That’s really what happened!”</p><p>He immediately put the Jade Fire Centipede into the Spirit Beast Pouch, turned his head and looked at Qin Sang, his gaze playful.</p><p>As if he was overjoyed to have gotten the Red Gold Tendril Spirit Fruit, the old monster decided to take the initiative to explain, “This old man enjoys collecting rare insects in the world. I happen to have heard that Devil Ancestor Kui Yin obtained the Heart-Devouring Bug from the ancient demons. I stayed hidden near Kui Yin Sect for over 30 years before finally finding a chance to capture someone who had been controlled by the Heart-Devouring Bug. But to my astonishment, the Heart-Devouring Bug turned out to be a dead creature, and Devil Ancestor Kui Yin used some special means to refine the remains of the bug into a poison bug. It looked perfect but was useless in the end and I wasted so much time on it. I never thought that Old Man Yi would be so ambitious. Not only did he attack Yuanzhao Sect, but he also dared to plot against Mount Shaohua. He didn’t even think about how capable he was. Without Devil Ancestor Kui Yin who was powerful enough to shake heaven and earth, Kui Yin Sect has become an empty shell. How dare they attempt to swallow the elephant? As expected, he ended up bursting from being too full… What was the purpose of you when Old Man Yi sent you to Mount Shaohua?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze flickered as Ground-Scar Senior believed that he was a spy planted in Mount Shaohua by Old Man Yi. This was the best outcome he could have hoped for.</p><p>He had no purpose, he merely wanted to find a place to stay.</p><p>“This junior does not know. Sect Leader Yi did not make it clear when he met me. Later, I got news that Kui Yin Sect had been destroyed by Yuanzhao Sect and Sect Leader Yi has never contacted me after that…”</p><p>Qin Sang answered.</p><p>Ground-Scar Senior sneered. “Old Man Yi has met his end, so of course he wouldn’t be able to contact you. Not only Old Man Yi, but Kui Yin Sect has also been pursued relentlessly by Yuanzhao Sect and is on the brink of extinction. There’s only a few members left and it’s no different from being exterminated. Out of the three great Gold Cores, only one is left and he was severely injured in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield due to the helpers invited by the new Sect Leader of Yuanzhao Sect. He was forced to give up his physical form and escape to save his life. He’s probably barely hanging on in some dark and gloomy corner, and may even have already died from the movement of the stars in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. So you don’t need to worry, no one from Kui Yin Sect will come to bother you again.”</p><p>Qin Sang has also been secretly investigating the current situation of Kui Yin Sect and Yuanzhao Sect, but he didn’t have many ways to do so. Coupled with the fact that Yuanzhao Sect seemed to be deliberately suppressing the news, the information he was able to get was dubious.</p><p>In particular, most of the information he heard about the Gold Core level was hearsay and not reliable.</p><p>This was the first time he heard about the exact whereabouts of the last Nascent Soul cultivator in Kui Yin Sect from Ground-Scar Senior.</p>
