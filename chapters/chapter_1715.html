<h1>Chapter 1706: Hunting the Fiend</h1><p>The skiff sailed the Western Desert.</p><p>Teleportation to the North Sea.</p><p>Entering the storm belt.</p><p>Hurricane winds howled, and human figures flew through the storm.</p><p>Before long, a golden light flew from the front, revealing a monk with a dignified and serene bearing, who pressed his palms together and bowed to Venerable Huiguang and the others.</p><p>“Xingzhi, has luring the fiend been smooth?” Venerable Huiguang asked.</p><p>“Reporting to Senior Uncle, frequent victories are being reported from the front. The carefully prepared lures set by fellow Daoists of various sects have all been effective.  There are no casualties so far, but no one dares to approach the fiend.  The fiend's strength remains unknown…”</p><p>Xingzhi reported the situation in detail.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang nodded and glanced at Holy King Qinghu.</p><p>“Old monk, set up the formation here.  Make sure there are no mistakes. This battle only allows victory, not defeat!” Holy King Qinghu stepped forward and disappeared into the depths of the storm in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The others followed Venerable Huiguang forward for a while and saw five celestial pillars standing straight on the sea surface from afar.</p><p>There were no islands below the celestial pillars, and it was unknown what supported them.  A cultivator sat cross-legged on top of each pillar.</p><p>The celestial pillars were made of extraordinary materials, forged jointly by the human and demon races. There were five identical celestial pillars and a group of formation guardians in the South, but they were not needed for the time being.</p><p>Before getting close, the avatar discerned some clues, "Golden Rainbow Formation, Earth Subduing Formation... all common Five Elements Formations in the cultivation world."</p><p>The avatar couldn't help but think of the Five Elements Divine Restrictions on Emperor Bestowal Mountain. These formations were not as profound as the Divine Restrictions, but they were superior in that they were controlled by people, more flexible, and the formation masters were all experts.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang made arrangements.  The main controllers of the Five Elements Formation were all eminent Buddhist monks.</p><p>In addition, a series of spirit formations with different functions were arranged around the perimeter, forming an inescapable net.</p><p>The formation was quickly arranged.</p><p>Experts from all sides continued to arrive, all following the Buddhist arrangements, some staying on the periphery, where the pressure would be less.  But there were also those who wanted to experience the might of the fiend up close, to reflect on themselves, so they entered the Five Elements Formation.</p><p>The avatar chose to stay outside, but saw Mo Xingdao summoned into the Five Elements Formation by Venerable Huiguang.</p><p>“This poor monk and the Holy King must control the Five Elements to wield the Five Elements Crown and cannot be distracted. When the fiend appears, we will need Fellow Daoist to act, using your puppets to lure the fiend into the trap,” Venerable Huiguang instructed Mo Xingdao.</p><p>With the assistance of numerous cultivators here, and several eminent Buddhist monks presiding over the formation able to share the pressure, the two Nascent Soul cultivators could manipulate the Five Elements Crown, freeing Mo Xingdao’s hands.</p><p>This was different from the fiend hunt at the Eight Sceneries. This time, the lure had to constantly engage and adjust to the fiend.  Others had to wait until the fiend was drawn to the converging point of the grand formation's energy before they could strike. There was no room for error, only then could complete success be achieved. Apart from the two Nascent Soul cultivators, only puppets proficient in Yin and Yang Escape techniques could accomplish this.</p><p>With the trap set, everyone waited intently for the fiend to appear.</p><p>No one noticed that someone had quietly approached.</p><p>Qin Sang, light as a swallow, bobbed on the water's surface, maintaining a safe distance, his gaze fixed on the distance.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, remaining motionless.</p><p>Time passed day by day.  Unexpectedly, a whole month passed without a sign of the fiend.</p><p>Just as everyone was letting their imaginations run wild, worrying if something had gone wrong, Holy King Qinghu finally returned.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A green shadow parted the waves and rushed into the formation.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu said in a solemn tone, “Be careful, the fiend's cultivation might be beyond early Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Venerable Huiguang and Mo Xingdao both looked serious upon hearing this, but showed no sign of retreat.</p><p>No matter how strong this fiend was, they had to face the challenge. No one knew when the next fiend would arrive, and they could not wait any longer.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mo…”</p><p>Venerable Huiguang shifted his gaze. Mo Xingdao nodded, listened to Holy King Qinghu describe the fiend’s divine abilities, and then flew out of the formation alone in the direction pointed out by the Holy King, a shadow following closely behind him.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Fierce winds and waves continuously battered the celestial pillars, causing them to slowly sink into the sea.</p><p>Everyone looked up at the depths of the storm, their nerves taut.</p><p>Suddenly, a roar like a thunderclap shook the heavens and earth. Judging from the roar, the fiend was still some distance away.</p><p>But the pressure from the roar penetrated the storm and traveled through the water. Everyone felt incredibly oppressed, and many showed looks of astonishment, witnessing such a terrifying fiend for the first time in their lives.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The roars grew closer and closer.</p><p>Soon, cultivators proficient in spiritual eye techniques saw a vision.</p><p>Waves surged in the distance, and a gigantic figure appeared in the storm.</p><p>Among those present were not only human cultivators but also demon kings. Seeing the fiend’s enormous body, they couldn’t help but think of the renowned Dragon Whale Great Sage of the East Sea.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Sage, possessing the bloodline of a dragon whale, was known as the foremost Great Sage of the demon race, independent of the Holy King’s Palace. Its true form was that of a dragon whale, its size unparalleled among the demon race of the East Sea.  Yet, compared to this fiend, it seemed petite and delicate.</p><p>A wall of water advanced towards them at an alarming speed, leaving the sea surface behind it pitch black.</p><p>The blackness was the fiend's body, shaped like a manta ray, its two fleshy wings extending endlessly. A gentle flap of its wings sent forth mountainous waves, its power comparable to the collapse of heaven and earth, chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>In front of the fiend, a human figure flickered in and out of existence.</p><p>Compared to the fiend, this human figure seemed exceptionally small. A casual wave from the fiend could crush him to dust, yet he was incredibly tenacious, vanishing into thin air whenever an attack approached, then reappearing ahead.</p><p>The fiend was enraged by this elusive little insect and pursued it relentlessly.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Everyone simultaneously received Venerable Huiguang's warning.</p><p>The avatar's gaze deepened as he looked towards the fiend, sensing that its pressure was even stronger than the one he encountered years ago.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The figure luring the fiend flickered again, reappearing very close to the formation, rushing inside through a gap deliberately left for it.</p><p>As the puppet charged forward, it was suddenly enveloped by a shadow.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock and horror, discovering that the fiend had somehow flown into the sky. Its wings were like clouds hanging from the heavens. Its left wing, carrying astonishing wind pressure, was aimed at the puppet, slamming down fiercely.</p><p>This wasn't ordinary wind pressure. It invoked the might of heaven and earth.  Anyone else would have already lost the ability to resist, but the puppet vanished into thin air once more.</p><p>The moment the puppet disappeared, a five-colored crown abruptly appeared above the fiend.</p><p>The difference in size between the two was vast, but the fluctuations emitted by the crown were no less impressive.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu stood on either side of the crown. The five celestial pillars simultaneously emerged from the sea surface, and the Five Elements Formation displayed five different phenomena, distinct from each other, yet connected through the Five Elements Crown.  All the phenomena combined to form a gigantic five-colored canopy, covering the sky and blotting out the sun, enveloping the fiend.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Five Elements Crown erupted with flowing light, appearing similar to before, but with different power.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Light of Restriction and Annihilation, restriction in the forward flow, annihilation in the reverse.</p><p>Back then, the ancient demon was intent on killing and used the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light from beginning to end. Now, the priority was to imprison the fiend.</p><p>Five-colored light instantly diffused across the fiend's entire body. Its black form immediately became multicolored, layers of light halos contracting like layers of cages.</p><p>Not only that, while the Five Elements Crown exerted its power, sounds of something piercing through the air rang out continuously. Iron chains like蛟dragons shot into the formation, connecting with each other, crisscrossing and entwining around the fiend, also carrying the power of imprisonment.</p><p>The avatar was one of those manipulating the iron chains.</p><p>There were also other various phenomena.  Everyone worked methodically, and the various arrangements took effect one after another, sealing off this area of heaven and earth along with the fiend that had crashed into it.</p><p>Before this, anyone who knew the full extent of the trap would have thought the cage was indestructible.</p><p>Next, they witnessed a shocking scene.</p><p>As the cage barely took shape, the fiend roared like thunder, and vast waves of smoke and mist suddenly surged from its body, like a bursting dam, powerful enough to shake heaven and earth.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’</p><p>More than half of the iron chains snapped. The celestial pillars swayed, and while the Five Elements Crown remained relatively stable, the two Nascent Soul cultivators were staggering.</p><p>Mo Xingdao reappeared in the distance, his heart pounding as he watched the scene.</p><p>He had several close calls while luring the fiend, using up all the treasures the two Nascent Soul cultivators had given him.</p><p>He took a few pills and quickly recovered, flying towards the battlefield.</p><p>Just as he was about to rejoin the formation, he suddenly heard a voice transmission, "Fellow Daoist Mo, do you happen to have the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit with you?"</p><p>It was Qin Sang, seeing the opportune moment, deciding to trade now!</p><p>Mo Xingdao paused slightly, his eyes flashing with surprise, "Has Fellow Daoist brought the Five Elements Pill?"</p><p>After a brief exchange, Mo Xingdao remained outside the battlefield, controlling his puppets remotely to assist the others.</p><p>By now, the confrontation had reached its fiercest point.</p><p>The fiend unleashed its divine might, but the other side had meticulously set a trap, with Nascent Soul cultivators presiding.  How could it be so easily breached?</p><p>After the initial chaos, they gradually figured out the fiend’s attack patterns and quickly adjusted.</p><p>The chains closed and broke, repeating countless times.  The avatar and the others manipulating the chains were also greatly exhausted.</p><p>"Prepare to merge the formation!"</p><p>Venerable Huiguang warned gravely. This was the crucial step that would determine victory or defeat. Once this step was successful, they would have a fifty percent chance of capturing the fiend alive. Of course, merging the formation also concealed dangers.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Liu…"</p><p>The avatar looked at a tall and thin Daoist beside him. This person was an elder of the Qiongying Sect, said to hail from an overseas immortal island.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Liu understood and took over control of the iron chains from the avatar. Similar rotations were happening elsewhere.</p><p>Those who were replaced retreated to recover. The avatar, however, retreated further and further, then turned and fled into the depths of the storm belt without looking back. Some people noticed his actions, dumbfounded.</p><p>Despite being at the crucial moment of merging the formation, Holy King Qinghu still glanced over, a hint of disdain flashing in his eyes, too lazy to pay attention.</p><p>Just as Mo Xingdao felt surprised and bewildered, a voice suddenly rang in his ear, "Fellow Daoist Mo, it's been a while."</p><p>The voice was close at hand.  Mo Xingdao's back tensed, a chill running through his body. He abruptly turned his head and saw a figure that had materialized beside him at some point.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>He never expected Qin Sang to dare show his true body!</p><p>No, not his true body, but an illusory form condensed from divine sense.  This wasn't a simple divine sense manifestation; it had actually condensed into a true form!</p><p>Mo Xingdao fully extended his divine sense, becoming even more astonished. This person’s true body must be nearby, yet he hadn’t sensed it at all.</p><p>The illusory figure held a jade bottle, smiling at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent and took out the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.</p><p>They confirmed the authenticity of each other's treasures.</p><p>The illusory figure vanished in a flash, its whereabouts unknown, leaving only a sentence, "Many thanks for your cooperation, Fellow Daoist. Until we meet again!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent, glancing at the fiercely contested battlefield. He wasn’t sure if the two Nascent Soul cultivators had noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, he turned his head and gazed at the endless storm, silent for a moment, then let out a soft sigh.</p><p>In the distance, the true body and the avatar reunited, putting away their treasures, and departed without hesitation.</p><p>"There was no demon king ambush…"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen complications, he had chosen to trade at this time, cunningly selecting the crucial moment of merging the formation.</p><p>He had expected Holy King Qinghu might order her subordinate demon kings to lay an ambush. Qin Sang wouldn’t have minded killing a few demon kings to enrich his treasury.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Holy King Qinghu had truly kept her word.</p><p>Little did he know that while Holy King Qinghu held the title of Holy King, she lacked the true substance of one.  Her murderous nature was too heavy, and she neglected external affairs.  The powerful clans within the East Sea demon race feared her, but their submission was merely superficial.  In reality, they secretly colluded and disobeyed her in secret.</p><p>The demon kings available to Holy King Qinghu were limited, and other demon kings might not be willing to offend a powerful enemy for her sake.</p><p>Unhindered all the way, escaping the storm belt, Qin Sang didn't dwell on it any longer and headed straight back to Deer Wild.</p><p>Spirit gathering formations, pills, spiritual materials…</p><p>He put away all the various treasures, but didn't examine them first.</p><p>There was something he had been eagerly anticipating, waiting for his avatar to return.</p><p>Deer Wild changed direction, traveling along the edge of the North Sea, heading directly west.</p><p>It continued until it neared the storm belt, stopping in an uninhabited area in the west.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar flew out of Deer Wild, entering a desolate mountain range.</p><p>This was a location Qin Sang had specifically chosen to summon a Heavenly Devil.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>Two figures flew to a spot above a basin.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guards stationed in the basin, sensing something, flew up to greet them.</p><p>“Patrol the surroundings. No one is allowed to approach!”</p><p>Qin Sang commanded sternly, landing on the ground.</p><p>Several black, square platforms stood in the basin, their material indiscernible.</p><p>There were seven platforms in total, arranged according to the positions of the Big Dipper.  There was nothing connecting the platforms, yet a mysterious aura flowed continuously between them.</p><p>This was the altar required by the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*.  It was less an altar and more a special formation that could break through invisible barriers and call upon Heavenly Devils from other realms.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to a position directly opposite the handle of the dipper.</p><p>His avatar also approached, standing behind Qin Sang, acting as a protector while also ready to switch places or take on any calamities.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down cross-legged, his mind focused inward, meditating quietly for a long while, silently circulating the secret technique within the *Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture*.</p><p>In the next moment, one of the seven platforms lit up with black light.</p><p>Above the platform, within the black light, a mass of black qi twisted and writhed.</p><p>Then the second platform displayed an anomaly.</p><p>The order in which the platforms transformed wasn't strictly based on their distance from Qin Sang; there was no discernible pattern.</p><p>As more and more platforms displayed anomalies, masses of black qi surrounded Qin Sang.  His consciousness subsequently fell into a hazy state, as if pulled into the depths of boundless void by a strange force.</p><p>He heard peculiar sounds, not human voices, but as if strange energies were flowing within the void.</p><p>His mind remained clear, not lost because of this. He focused on recalling the scripture.</p><p>According to the scripture, when the secret technique was completed and a Heavenly Devil was contacted, there would be a special sensation.</p><p>However, as time passed and the secret technique was completed, Qin Sang didn't sense anything unusual.</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill descend.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p>
