<h1>Chapter 409: Good News</h1><p>The Flying Horned Wyverns still gathered and swam in the secluded pool.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if Wandering Scholar would be curious about why the pool had suddenly expanded several times its original size.</p><p>He stealthily dripped the Bewitching Venom, masking his presence from the wyverns, and returned the way he came.</p><p>Having not encountered Wandering Scholar along the way, Qin Sang had to leave alone, smoothly arriving at the plains before the inner valley barrier.</p><p>Within the mountain, the Star-Venom Toads' habitat was the only place Qin Sang worried about. He was concerned that the two Wuji Sect members had also returned and might encounter him there.</p><p>However, staying in the inner valley was even more dangerous. With a firm resolve, Qin Sang entered the mountains.</p><p>Fortunately, there weren't so many coincidences. Qin Sang left the inner valley safe and sound.</p><p>Traveling on and off, it took Qin Sang a full fortnight to leave Boundless Valley and head straight for Azure Sun Market.</p><p>Wandering Scholar hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>He and Wandering Scholar had agreed to meet here after leaving Boundless Valley.</p><p>Since Wandering Scholar had successfully obtained the Midnight Lily, Qin Sang wasn't worried.</p><p>He guessed that Wandering Scholar was probably refining the spirit herb within Boundless Valley. After all, it was a coveted treasure, and having finally glimpsed the hope of healing his hidden injuries, Wandering Scholar must have been eager to start.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang waited patiently in Azure Sun Market.</p><p>During these days, he didn't stay in his cave to cultivate, but frequently went out to inquire about the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, especially about the Azure Sun罡Qi within it.</p><p>Nine days later.</p><p>Returning from outside, just as Qin Sang was about to open his cave, his eyes suddenly narrowed, then lit up with joy. Pushing the door open, he saw Wandering Scholar sitting peacefully inside.</p><p>Wandering Scholar's complexion was radiant, noticeably better than before, with no trace of old age.</p><p>Even more astonishing was his cultivation level, now at Foundation Establishment Mid-Stage, on par with Qin Sang.</p><p>He had finally crossed that threshold!</p><p>"Congratulations, Senior, on healing your hidden injuries!"</p><p>Qin Sang was happy for Wandering Scholar and offered his congratulations repeatedly.</p><p>Because of his hidden injuries, although Wandering Scholar possessed profound cultivation, he was unable to break through to Foundation Establishment Mid-Stage.  This was why he had reluctantly stopped cultivating and traveled far and wide, searching for pills and medicines.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that in less than a month, Wandering Scholar would not only refine the Midnight Lily, but also experience such immediate effects, directly breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p>"Thanks to you, Brother Qin!"</p><p>With his greatest worry resolved, Wandering Scholar's eyes couldn't hide his joy. He stood up and bowed to Qin Sang. "Although I haven't completely healed my injuries, at least before the Core Formation stage, I won't have to worry about my cultivation being limited by them. I can return to my sect and focus on cultivating for a while!"</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly upon hearing this. "Senior, you consumed the spirit herb, but it didn't fully heal your hidden injuries?"</p><p>Wandering Scholar shook his head.</p><p>"The Midnight Lily I consumed, although a heavenly treasure, wasn't specifically targeted towards my injuries. Fortunately, its potency is strong, and it still played a significant role, addressing the urgent issue. I am already very content.</p><p>"Moreover, although my Nascent Soul is injured, it may not necessarily affect Core Formation. The specific situation won't be clear until after the Pseudo Core stage.</p><p>"However, by then, I will be far more capable. Even if it does affect Core Formation, seeking other healing spirit herbs won't be as difficult, though not necessarily easy."</p><p>Wandering Scholar stood tall, his expression and tone filled with confidence and fighting spirit, without a trace of hesitation.</p><p>Infected by Wandering Scholar's emotions, Qin Sang nodded slightly. He also believed that with Wandering Scholar's character and abilities, he would definitely achieve his goals and resolve the hidden dangers!</p><p>"Brother Qin, I am limited by age and strive against time. I dare not delay my cultivation. Now that I can finally address this hidden danger, I must return to my sect first. Could you grant me some time? Once my cultivation is stabilized, I'll go request the Harmonizing Pill." Wandering Scholar said sheepishly.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "Senior, there's no need to rush. My injuries don't affect my cultivation. As long as you find a Harmonizing Pill for me before I prepare for Core Formation, it's fine. Please prioritize your own cultivation. If I encounter any difficulties in the future, I might have to rely on you, Senior."</p><p>Wandering Scholar breathed a sigh of relief. Hearing this, he said seriously, "Thank you, Brother! Don't worry, if you face any difficulties in the future, just send a message to the Taiyi Pill Sect, and I will do my best to help! Upon returning, I will visit Li Yufu at Emerald Bright Mountain and accept him as my disciple. I hope this young man can withstand the loneliness of the immortal path and live up to your expectations!"</p><p>Then, the two talked about some other matters, and Qin Sang seized the opportunity to ask Wandering Scholar about many cultivation questions.</p><p>Wandering Scholar had just broken through to Foundation Establishment Mid-Stage, and his cultivation was not as high as Qin Sang's, but he had very insightful perspectives on many issues and was more than capable of guiding Qin Sang, greatly benefiting him.</p><p>"Are you interested in the Dry Sky罡Qi, Brother?"</p><p>Wandering Scholar was a little surprised to hear Qin Sang ask about Dry Sky罡Qi, but didn't inquire further. After thinking for a moment, he said, "Although Dry Sky罡Qi is as famous as Earthly Yin Qi, the Dry Sky罡Qi formed in the mortal world is far rarer than Earthly Yin Veins. As far as I know, there are only two places in the entire Small Cold Realm where Dry Sky罡Qi exists! One is the Azure Sun Demonic Sect."</p><p>Wandering Scholar pointed north, in the direction of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. After these days of inquiries, he had learned that Dry Sky罡Qi was much rarer than he had imagined. After searching for so long, he hadn't found any useful information.</p><p>"Where is the other one?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Wandering Scholar gave Qin Sang a meaningful look, then shook his head. "Brother Qin, I don't know why you're looking for Dry Sky罡Qi. Take my advice, unless you desperately need it, it's best not to target these two locations.</p><p>"The Azure Sun Demonic Sect goes without saying. The Azure Sun罡Qi is related to the Azure Sun Demonic Fire and is the foundation of their sect, located in a heavily guarded area.</p><p>"The other location with Dry Sky罡Qi, although not a demonic sect, is even more dangerous. It's in the cave residence of the current number one cultivator in the Small Cold Realm, the Pure Yang Sect Master!"</p><p>"The Pure Yang Sect Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, shocked.</p><p>The Pure Yang Sect was the most prominent among the Eight Righteous Sects, thanks to the formidable strength of its Sect Master, rumored to be the number one cultivator and the strongest Nascent Soul expert in the Small Cold Realm!</p><p>Even with a hundred times the courage, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to target the Pure Yang Sect Master!</p><p>"Why would a Nascent Soul expert's cave residence be built on Dry Sky罡Qi?"</p><p>Qin Sang was very unwilling. He had originally wanted to collect the Dry Sky罡Qi in advance as a precaution.</p><p>Although Wu Shang had mentioned in his letter that Dry Sky罡Qi was hard to find, who would have thought there were only two locations in the entire Small Cold Realm, both occupied by powerful figures!</p><p>Wandering Scholar said, "It's said that the Pure Yang Sect Master's cultivation technique is special and requires Dry Sky罡Qi. Some suspect that it is precisely because of this technique that the Pure Yang Sect Master became the number one expert in the Small Cold Realm. If that's true, it's unlikely he would be willing to part with it. However… if Brother Qin could ask your sect's Nascent Soul ancestor to intervene and request some Dry Sky罡Qi, he probably wouldn't refuse Duke Dongyang."</p><p>"Senior, don't joke. I don't have that kind of influence…"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly and sighed.</p>
