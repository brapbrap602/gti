<h1>Chapter 1910: Ancestor Guan</h1><p>Tianliang Mountain, Yu Daozi.</p><p>Qin Sang learned a new name.</p><p>“Yu Daozi knew about the Yin family's collusion with the Thirteen Eagles of the Northern Desert?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Patriarch Yin’s expression suddenly became vacant.</p><p>“I was only a registered disciple of Master. After breaking through to the Golden Core realm, I was sent down the mountain to manage the Yin family in Sihuo Town. I rarely saw Master's face. Although the Thirteen Eagles of the Northern Desert have some connections with my Yin family, it was Senior Brother Huang who orchestrated it…”</p><p>“Senior Brother Huang was originally Master's third disciple and had already reached the Nascent Soul realm. I don't know what offense he committed, but he was suddenly expelled from the sect and became a pariah. Senior Brother Huang then joined Mingshan, one of the so-called Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds…”</p><p>“Master has countless registered disciples.  Not only our Yin family, but also various powers throughout the desert send their descendants to Tianliang Mountain. Most of them will be accepted as registered disciples by Master…”</p><p>“After these registered disciples descend the mountain, they all have contact with Senior Brother Huang. Senior Brother Huang ordered us to secretly recruit sand bandits. Occasionally, Mingshan would send orders, asking us to do things and relay messages…”</p><p>“If there were benefits, we would receive at least thirty percent…”</p><p>Patriarch Yin sat upright in the high chair, speaking freely, revealing hidden secrets as if reporting to a superior.</p><p>He spoke of arson, murder, and plunder, but his tone and demeanor were frighteningly calm.</p><p>Witnessing this bizarre scene, Patriarch Gu froze in place, not daring to move, his forehead twitching, and cold sweat drenching his body.</p><p>“Another Three Mountain Bandit Stronghold emerges. It seems I'll have to visit them one by one.” Qin Sang shook his head and looked at Patriarch Gu.</p><p>“Is Patriarch Gu also a registered disciple of Yu Daozi?”</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, Patriarch Gu's heart lurched, and he couldn't help but gulp.</p><p>‘Gulp!’</p><p>The sound was extremely jarring in the hall. He wished he could slap himself, and carefully said, “Senior, you are discerning. My Gu family has absolutely no connection with Tianliang Mountain or the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds. I never thought Patriarch Yin would dare to harbor sand bandits and slaughter innocents…”</p><p>Under Qin Sang's knowing gaze, Patriarch Gu gradually trailed off, finally letting out a wry smile.</p><p>“If I were to say I knew nothing, Senior would certainly not believe me. Although the Yin family always hides behind the scenes, they inevitably leave traces. I did indeed suspect them long ago. However, my Gu family could only establish connections with Hunye City to secure our position as the rulers of Sihuo Town. How could Hunye City compare to Tianliang Mountain? I could only secretly restrain the Yin family, preventing them from being too blatant…</p><p>“To be honest with Senior, I only just learned about the Yin family's relationship with the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds.</p><p>“Fortunately, Tianliang Mountain considers itself righteous, and the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds also have their scruples.  Thus, a fragile balance is maintained. If I were to truly confront the Yin family, I fear my Gu family would be trampled flat by sand bandits the next day…”</p><p>Patriarch Gu lamented, venting his inner anguish and fear.</p><p>He rambled on, but received no response. Only then did he realize that the two were long gone.</p><p>Turning his head, he saw Patriarch Yin had already expired.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Patriarch Gu rushed out of the hall to find all of Patriarch Yin's personal guards lying on the ground, as if asleep, dead without a sound.</p><p>Voices could still be heard within the Yin Estate.</p><p>Some lived, some died.</p><p>“Not completely annihilated?”</p><p>Patriarch Gu was puzzled, unable to fathom the mysterious person's intentions. He swiftly returned to the Gu Estate, immediately ordering all Gu family members to return and remain indoors, while secretly dispatching people to investigate.</p><p>Soon, someone reported back.</p><p>“What happened to the Gou family?” Patriarch Gu anxiously inquired.</p><p>“The Second and Third Branches, those close to the Yin family, suffered heavy losses among their experts, with some even dying in their own meditation chambers. The entire Gou Estate is in chaos, and the news has spread throughout the city…”</p><p>“Karma, retribution… Could there truly be a soul-reaping Yama in this world?”</p><p>People often say there are deities watching from above.</p><p>But cultivators all know that the Divine Dao is in decline, and such rumors hold sway only among the mortals in the south and are completely disregarded by cultivators.</p><p>It is said that there are powerful beings among the mountain spirits and earth deities, but neither in number nor strength can they compare to cultivators. The dominant power in this region, the Cloud Capital Heaven, is a cultivation sect.</p><p>Patriarch Gu dismissed his subordinates with a wave of his hand, collapsing into his chair, his gaze fixed on the carved beams and painted rafters above, his eyes vacant.</p><p>A long time passed.</p><p>A faint sigh echoed through the room.</p><p>“Those who commit too much evil… will inevitably face divine retribution someday.”</p><p>…</p><p>A chilling wind blew.</p><p>The world was shrouded in a grayish haze.</p><p>The gray fog was actually sand and dust whipped up by the wind.</p><p>For hundreds of miles around, the sand was gray. Once the wind picked up, even in broad daylight, the sky would darken, creating a gloomy atmosphere.</p><p>Beneath the wind and sand, majestic mountains and towering ridges sprawled across the land like crouching dragons.</p><p>The mountains emanated a sinister aura, like a man-eating beast, daunting to behold.</p><p>Several figures appeared at the foot of the mountains, slowly walking towards the range.</p><p>“This is Mingshan.”</p><p>Qin Sang had eliminated numerous sand bandits along the way, yet there wasn't a trace of blood on him.</p><p>He had gained a deeper understanding of the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds.</p><p>The Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds referred to Mingshan, Luomeng Mountain, and Jishan. They were said to be the lairs of the three most powerful sand bandit forces in the Northern Desert, and also served as the headquarters for the sand bandit alliance.</p><p>The three mountains were interconnected, each with a Nascent Soul ancestor presiding over them. Although they started as sand bandits, they had now become three unfathomable forces, and even the cultivation sects of the Northern Desert were wary of them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the mountain's terrain and headed towards the main peak.</p><p>They did not conceal their presence, and their arrival in Mingshan was immediately detected.</p><p>“State your name!”</p><p>A towering pillar of fire suddenly erupted from the summit, accompanied by a thunderous shout.</p><p>Under the firelight, several figures flickered in and out of view, their auras sharp, their voices filled with killing intent.</p><p>Before the words could fade, they were interrupted by a rumble of thunder.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Thunder echoed through the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dark clouds gathered, and Mingshan, already dim due to the wind and sand, became pitch black.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning descended from the heavens, striking the fire pillar directly.</p><p>Amidst cries of alarm, the fire was extinguished. Those beneath the pillar, though not struck dead, were involuntarily flung into the air.</p><p>“I've plundered nine times…”</p><p>“I once followed the Mountain Lord to slaughter three sects…”</p><p>“I seized women as concubines, and if they dared to refuse, I annihilated their entire families…”</p><p>…</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, the individuals confessed their crimes, their voices resounding throughout Mingshan.</p><p>After confessing, thunderbolts descended from the sky, obliterating them on the spot, their blood writing their sins.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The sound of thunder reverberated through Mingshan.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the mountains, yet his speed was not slow at all. Every time he passed a peak, similar scenes would unfold.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Lightning bolts rained down, one after another.</p><p>This scene resembled divine punishment!</p><p>The thunderclouds and lightning followed Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>Qin Sang resembled a deity, though in the eyes of those in the mountains, he was a terrifying demon god!</p><p>Under the lightning, Mingshan was illuminated as bright as day, revealing countless terrified faces.</p><p>Within Mingshan, who didn't have innocent blood on their hands?</p><p>For a time, panic gripped Mingshan.</p><p>At the main peak of Mingshan, the summit was resplendent with gold and jade. Figures continuously flickered, among them Nascent Soul cultivators with powerful auras.</p><p>The leader was a refined man with a feather fan and silk scarf, the very Senior Brother Huang mentioned by Patriarch Yin, named Huang Daoxun.</p><p>At this moment, his composure was gone, replaced by fury.</p><p>“Who is he! Which blind fool provoked such a powerful enemy?”</p><p>His roar echoed across the summit.</p><p>Everyone remained silent, unable to offer an answer.</p><p>A black-robed elder beside him spoke, “There was news earlier of several sand bandit groups in the north being mysteriously annihilated. It should be this person's doing.  This old man was just about to descend the mountain to investigate, but I didn't expect him to dare attack Mingshan.  This person's strength is unfathomable.  Perhaps someone mistakenly harmed his descendants. Mountain Lord, please calm down, let's inquire and hand the person over…”</p><p>Huang Daoxun took a deep breath, composing himself, and shouted, “Activate the Nine Formations of Youtian!”</p><p>With that, he led the black-robed elder and others, mounting their flying swords and heading towards the front mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>"The Dao Court Thunder Arts are truly extraordinary. Using them to empower the Jade Clarity Summoning Thunder Talisman, which holds the rudimentary High Upper Divine Firmament Lightning Method… I thought I had already thoroughly grasped it, but it seems there are so many more variations…”</p><p>Qin Sang led his horse into the mountains, accompanied by heavenly thunder.</p><p>He didn't even glance at the sand bandits struck down by lightning, but instead focused on comprehending the Thunder Arts.</p><p>He started with the familiar talisman that held three Dao methods and gradually delved into the Five Thunders Academy's Thunder Arts.</p><p>In a short time, he had made considerable progress.</p><p>Just then, the earth trembled before him. Nine peaks surrounding the main peak erupted with soaring profound yellow spiritual light, clearly activating the protective mountain formation.</p><p>Between two beams of spiritual light, several figures flew towards him, their magical treasures already summoned, their faces filled with vigilance.</p><p>The leading Huang Daoxun cupped his hands from afar, “This humble one is Huang Daoxun, Mountain Lord of Mingshan. I don't know where I have offended fellow Daoist, why…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Huang Daoxun saw Qin Sang look up and smile warmly at him, his heart inexplicably skipping a beat.</p><p>Then, Huang Daoxun witnessed a scene he would never forget.</p><p>The harmless-looking little girl on horseback raised her right hand and extended a finger.</p><p>A five-colored beam of light shot out from her fingertip, as slender as the girl's finger itself.</p><p>The beam was silent.</p><p>Struck by the beam, one of the peaks, the foundation of the Nine Formations of Youtian, exploded with a deafening roar.</p><p>An entire mountain peak, right beside them, had been shattered.</p><p>In their minds, the impenetrable Nine Formations of Youtian were as if nonexistent.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Qin Sang gently patted Xiao Wu's small hand.</p><p>He could have broken the formation with his Thunder Arts, but a large part of this trip down the mountain was for Xiao Wu, so he had to let her participate.</p><p>The newly formed formation immediately displayed a massive gap.</p><p>Before Huang Daoxun could recover from the shock, the sounds of self-confessed crimes echoed from behind him, as thunderclouds enveloped the main peak.</p><p>These voices included the Nascent Soul elders of Mingshan!</p><p>“My master is Elder Yu Daozi of Tianliang Mountain! You cannot kill me!”</p><p>Huang Daoxun cried out in terror.</p><p>“So, your wickedness down here was supported by your master?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Back then, it was Master who secretly ordered me down the mountain…”</p><p>Huang Daoxun's eyes glazed over as he spoke, slowly rising into the air, perishing under the heavenly thunder.</p><p>When the dark clouds dispersed and the thunder subsided, a deathly silence fell over Mingshan. The few survivors fled in terror.</p><p>…</p><p>Throughout the Fire Domain and into the desert, Tianliang Mountain was a rather prestigious sect.</p><p>Although there were no Deity Transformation cultivators within the sect, both the Grand Elder and the Sect Master were powerful Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators.</p><p>Unlike the demon-infested Muluo Mountain Range, the Fire Domain, due to its connection to the Cloud Capital Mountain, had reputable forces that generally acted righteously. Tianliang Mountain had a decent reputation.</p><p>On this day, Tianliang Mountain received two uninvited guests.</p><p>Inside the Welcoming Guests Hall.</p><p>The Sect Master of Tianliang Mountain, in a rare occurrence, personally appeared to receive the guests. However, the atmosphere in the hall was tense.</p><p>“Is fellow Daoist joking?  My Tianliang Mountain's Grand Elder, colluding with sand bandits?  Preposterous!  Who dares to slander him!”</p><p>The Tianliang Mountain Sect Master slammed the table and stood up.</p><p>The Daoist and the little girl opposite him remained unmoved.</p><p>“Truly worthy of a renowned sect. These spirit fruits are excellent. Xiao Wu, try some…”</p><p>Qin Sang handed Xiao Wu a fruit and looked at the Tianliang Mountain Sect Master, “Slander or not, summon your Grand Elder for a confrontation, and wouldn't it be clear? Hiding in his cave like a turtle, can he wash away his sins?”</p><p>The last sentence boomed like thunder, echoing out of the hall and shaking the entire sect.</p><p>“Insolent!”</p><p>The Tianliang Mountain Sect Master's expression changed drastically, then froze.</p><p>In the east, lightning illuminated the sky. Thunder, like a dragon, streaked towards a spiritual peak, descending with unstoppable force. The Tianliang Mountain formation didn't even have time to react.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The summit exploded, accompanied by a shrill scream.</p><p>A distorted figure emerged, flickering with lightning, wrapped in thunderous chains, limbs involuntarily spread as if suspended in mid-air.</p><p>A Whip Dragon Lightning Talisman had directly captured Yu Daozi from his cave.</p><p>All the disciples of Tianliang Mountain witnessed their lofty Grand Elder, powerless to resist, being dragged towards the Welcoming Guests Hall.</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>The Tianliang Mountain Sect Master pointed at Qin Sang, trembling with rage and shock.</p><p>“Who are you! If you dare kill me, my Ancestor will avenge me! Ancestor, save me!”</p><p>Yu Daozi, restrained before the hall, struggled frantically and roared madly, like a lunatic.</p><p>Hearing the roar, the Tianliang Mountain Sect Master was also stunned.  If Tianliang Mountain had an ancestor, how could someone act so recklessly within their sect?</p><p>“There's someone above you?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled in surprise.  Others would have the elders come after the younger ones were dealt with, but he had killed the younger one and was actively seeking out the elder.</p><p>Judging by the Tianliang Mountain Sect Master's expression, it seemed some conspiracy shrouded Tianliang Mountain and even this part of the cultivation world, a conspiracy he had inadvertently disrupted.</p><p>"Ancestor Guan is a mighty being from another domain, lurking in the Fire Origin Valley.  I acted on Ancestor Guan's orders, secretly sending disciples down the mountain, cultivating forces for his use, and gathering various blood medicines and cauldron vessels for him. When the time is ripe, he will replace the Sect Master…”</p><p>Yu Daozi suddenly stopped struggling, voluntarily revealing his scheme.</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Daozi’s expression became increasingly contorted.  Despite being a Nascent Soul late-stage expert, he couldn't break free from Qin Sang’s control.</p><p>Uproar erupted throughout Tianliang Mountain.</p><p>The Tianliang Mountain Sect Master regained his composure, silently watching the unsightly Yu Daozi.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Grand Elder's body suddenly exploded, just like the sand bandits, his flesh and blood becoming ink, writing his crimes on the mountain wall.</p><p>Countless crimes, too numerous to record.</p><p>At some point, both Qin Sang and Xiao Wu had vanished. The Tianliang Mountain Sect Master remained standing where he was, motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Tianliang Mountain, Qin Sang suddenly increased his speed, flying directly towards the Fire Origin Valley.</p><p>As the wind whistled past, Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He had killed countless evildoers along the way, yet it seemed to have little effect on his enlightenment.</p><p>“Did I misunderstand the Sword Spirit's meaning, or are these opponents too weak? Do evildoers also have a hierarchy? This Ancestor Guan is a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator, a formidable figure by any measure. He's perfect for verification…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, soon spotting a fiery red valley.</p>
