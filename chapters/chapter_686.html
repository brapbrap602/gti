<h1>Chapter 678 Refining Instruments</h1><p>Chapter 678 Refining Instruments</p><p>For cultivators, as long as spiritual energy is abundant, nothing is a problem.</p><p>The city on Duyan Island, though seemingly simple and crude, actually houses a considerable number of ordinary people and low-level cultivators, presenting a thriving scene.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, few places can maintain stability like Duyan Island.  With abundant demonic beast resources nearby, not only are the original islanders prospering, but many cultivators from other places are venturing across the sea by boat.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Ran Luo and others off the boat and, under Ran Luo's guidance, easily found the cave abode.</p><p>The cave abode chosen by Elder Zou was on the edge of the city, near a barren mountain.  This location was carefully selected.</p><p>This mountain is called Red Stone Mountain. Unlike other stone mountains, the stones on this mountain have a faint reddish hue, due to an underground fire vein within. The island lord has created many fire chambers on the mountain, making it an excellent place for both instrument and pill refinement.</p><p>Ran Luo and Elder Zou were organizing personnel, leaving Qin Sang undisturbed in his cultivation.</p><p>Ten days later, Ran Luo came to visit.</p><p>“Daoist, have you rested well? If you are free, shall we begin refining the magical instruments now?  Our Chamber of Commerce has acquired many demonic beast corpses in this period, enough to fill several warehouses.  Elder Zou and the Chamber's alchemists have already sorted them; parts suitable for refining  煞妖丹 (Sha Yao Dan) and 血骨丹 (Xue Gu Dan) and other spirit pills have been set aside. There's still more than half left, and we need to ask for your help, Daoist.  Everything is ready on Red Stone Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang was already prepared and readily agreed, “Please lead the way, Daoist Ran.”</p><p>Refining instruments on Duyan Island necessitates going to Red Stone Mountain.  Especially for large-scale refining of instruments and pills, a cultivator's spiritual fire would be insufficient to meet the demands.</p><p>Qin Sang was reluctant to expose his Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and needed the earth fire as cover.</p><p>Renting a fire chamber on the mountain was expensive; the Qiong Yu Chamber of Commerce was paying, and he certainly wouldn't try to save them money.</p><p>The two walked side-by-side, quickly arriving at Red Stone Mountain.</p><p>Ascending Red Stone Mountain, one could feel the intense heat of the earth fire permeating the air. An ordinary person would likely dehydrate and die there within a short time.</p><p>Ran Luo led Qin Sang through a winding path to a stone wall halfway up the mountain.</p><p>A cave entrance had been carved beneath the stone wall, with several people waiting there.</p><p>Elder Zou was among them.</p><p>Behind Elder Zou stood two individuals. One was a kind-looking, smiling old man with a white beard. He nodded amiably to Qin Sang and Ran Luo upon seeing them.</p><p>The other was a thin young man with a stern expression. Qin Sang keenly sensed hostility in the young man's gaze.</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, remembering the identities of these two individuals.</p><p>He had heard Ran Luo mention previously that the white-bearded elder was the chief alchemist recruited by Elder Zou, and the thin young man was an instrument refiner.</p><p>“Blocking someone else’s path,”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, but he didn't feel much, nor did he care about the thin young man's hostility.</p><p>Instrument refinement, too, comes down to skill. If he was outmatched, there was nothing to say.  If his skill surpassed the thin young man’s, the position of chief instrument refiner would naturally be his.</p><p>“Daoist has arrived,” Elder Zou greeted them, stepping aside. “Allow me to introduce you.  Elder Jia is an old friend of mine; I practically forced him out of retirement to help. This is Daoist Zhuo. Daoist Zhuo hails from the renowned Jian Ding Sect, a very famous sect in the entire East Sea region.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, “This humble cultivator, Qingfeng, greets both Daoist friends.”</p><p>He had never heard of Jian Ding Sect, guessing it was a sect known for its instrument refining in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The young man surnamed Zhuo remained composed, returning Qin Sang’s bow calmly, curiously asking, “I wonder which sect Daoist Qingfeng belongs to? Elder Zou and Manager Ran spoke highly of your skills in instrument refinement. You must have unique insights into this Dao. Perhaps your sect has ties to our Jian Ding Sect?”</p><p>“This humble cultivator is a wandering cultivator. I inadvertently obtained a method of instrument refinement; it likely has no connection to your honorable sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.  Young Master Zhuo did not press further.</p><p>Elder Zou took out a pouch and handed it to Qin Sang.  “Daoist, please examine.  How many magical instruments can you refine from the spirit materials and demonic beast corpses inside?”</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the contents with his spiritual sense, discovering a wealth of items within the pouch: many spirit materials, beast bones and hides; there was even a complete spine, seemingly that of a Jiao dragon.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined everything, then pondered for a moment before saying, "With these materials, I should be able to refine five top-grade artifacts.  Lower-grade artifacts are harder to estimate; it depends on how many materials are left."</p><p>"Five?"</p><p>Elder Zou and Elder Jia exchanged surprised glances.</p><p>The thin young man, however, was stunned, his face showing disbelief. He himself had only dared to attempt three top-grade artifacts to ensure a successful outcome. He exclaimed, "With just these materials, you can really refine five top-grade artifacts?  Are you exaggerating?"</p><p>Qin Sang confidently replied, "My fellow Daoists, please wait a few days. You'll know after I've finished refining them."</p><p>Elder Zou clapped his hands. "Excellent! The furnace room has been prepared for you, Daoist. No one will disturb you during this time.  If you need anything, just instruct the staff. Elder Zou will await the good news."</p><p>A guard then emerged, and Qin Sang took his leave, following the guard into the cave.  He selected a high-quality furnace room.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang enter the cave, Elder Zou smiled slightly and turned to Ran Luo. "That Daoist Qingfeng can actually refine five top-grade artifacts.  Such skill is rare even in the entire Eastern Extreme Alliance. It's a pity he can't refine magical treasures, but this is still quite remarkable.  Manager Ran, you deserve the credit for recruiting him."</p><p>"Previously, Daoist Zhuo told me he could only guarantee refining three top-grade artifacts. Daoist Qingfeng immediately offered five, and with such confidence. It doesn't seem to be an exaggeration.  We should indeed congratulate Elder Zou on recruiting such talent,"</p><p>Elder Jia added.</p><p>The thin young man remained silent. If this person could truly deliver, he, being outmatched, dared not express any further dissatisfaction.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man who had been silently observing stepped forward and said in a deep voice, "Elder Zou, Manager Ran said this person has been wearing a hood since arriving from the Witch God Continent and has never shown his true face.  Could he have committed a crime in the Inner Sea? If we don't investigate his identity, we might be implicated."</p><p>Elder Zou shook his head. "We're only engaging Daoist Qingfeng as an Outer Sea guest cultivator. Even if he committed a grave crime in the Inner Sea, what does it have to do with us? There's no need to worry. In a few days, after Daoist Qingfeng emerges, we'll formally appoint him.  Then I'll go to other islands to check on the Chamber of Commerce's business.  The affairs on Duoyan Island are now sorted.  From now on, internal matters will be handled by Elder Jia, and external affairs by Manager Ran.  I ask everyone to cooperate."</p><p>Everyone readily agreed.</p>
