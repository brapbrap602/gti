<h1>Chapter 275: Invitation from Brother Yu</h1><p>Even if the uncharted herb garden doesn’t have Spirit Herbs that can make up for the foundation, there might be other good things. In any case, it won’t be a loss.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Corpse Puppets were all destroyed, only a few zombies remained.</p><p>But after thinking it over, Qin Sang still decided to focus on tempering the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman, and if possible, restore it before he set off.</p><p>On one hand, it’s hard to procure the corpses of Foundation Establishment Cultivators; when he used to go fishing, it took a long time to succeed even once. On the other hand, when it comes to life preservation, the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman is far more useful than Corpse Puppets.</p><p>Qin Sang had yet to learn about the true power of the Talisman, but he could guess that when it was fully restored and he activated it, at the very least his speed would be comparable to that of Foundation Establishment Late-stage Cultivators.</p><p>This would allow him to respond calmly to many dangerous moments.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman in his palm and communicated with the Vermillion Serpent’s spirit essence in the Talisman, learning that the essence’s spirit had first been gravely injured by the Golden Bell and then had consumed large amounts of energy to resist being swallowed by the magma; it would also need quite a long time to recover.</p><p>If he could restore the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman, it would also speed up the recovery of the spirit essence.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang had subdued the Vermillion Serpent’s spirit essence, he wasn’t afraid of it turning against him when it completely recovered. Moreover, the Vermillion Serpent’s spirit essence wasn’t a true Vermillion Serpent, but was more like a Spirit Device that could unleash the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman’s speed. It didn’t have any great fighting capabilities and couldn’t help in battle.</p><p>After communicating with the Vermillion Serpent’s spirit essence and gaining a deeper understanding of the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman, Qin Sang put it back in his Dantian and used his full strength to activate his Spiritual Qi, wrapping it around the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman.</p><p>As the tendrils of Spiritual Qi entered the Talisman, it shone brilliantly. Vaguely, one could hear the roars of a Vermillion Serpent. The two halves of the Talisman began to slowly join together, and a milky white light flashed across the joint.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sensed that the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman’s recovery speed had increased by severalfold. He nodded slightly, stopped for now, and turned his gaze to the bone fragment.</p><p>《Book of the Void Seal》 and 《Soul Stealing Curse》 were essential to master. Besides these, there were also a few very useful magic incantations in 《Sounds of the Ascended Demons》, and Qin Sang prepared to cultivate them together.</p><p>Qin Sang sent his divine sense into the bone fragment, closed both eyes, and the cave fell into silence.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, divine light shooting from them, and he cried in a low voice, “Congeal!”</p><p>Before him, a fantastical giant seal abruptly took shape; it was square and bare save for a few mysterious seal characters. As Qin Sang’s thoughts raced, the seal suddenly shrank and then flew into his forehead.</p><p>Inside his Divine Soul Space, the Jade Buddha shone goldenly. The Heart Devouring Insect Gu was quietly趴着 outside the golden light.</p><p>At this moment, the Void Seal flew over, fitted over the Heart Devouring Insect, and sealed it. The undulations emitted by the Heart Devouring Insect were suppressed to the lowest level.</p><p>This small worry could finally be resolved.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a heavy weight lift from his heart and his body suddenly relax slightly. He revealed a faint smile on his face and immediately mastered the magic incantations of 《Soul Stealing Curse》 and so on. Then, while he dedicated himself to tempering the Nine Dragons Celestial Carriage Talisman, he also awaited the arrival of the Cloud Demonist.</p><p>Cultivation passed without end, and a year quickly flew by.</p><p>Suddenly, the cave’s restriction was touched.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditation. The Talisman rotated slowly in his Qi Sea, and the crack in the middle had become much smaller. It was just a fine line that couldn’t be perceived by the naked eye. The Vermillion Serpent’s spirit essence had also recovered a lot and no longer seemed so weak.</p><p>Now that the Talisman could barely be used, it should be capable of reaching the speed of Foundation Establishment Middle-stage.</p><p>However, the Talisman was still very fragile, and one had to be careful when using it.</p><p>Qin Sang, pensive, opened his eyes and sent his divine sense outside. He was surprised to find that the person outside his cave wasn’t the Cloud Demonist, but Yu Daiyue.</p><p>What brought him here?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a secret doubt, but he couldn’t keep the man from his door, so he withdrew the cave’s restrictions and got up to welcome him.</p><p>“Brother Yu, what business brought you to my humble cave? Please, come inside.”</p><p>Qin Sang put on a smile and cordially invited Yu Daiyue inside.</p><p>“I learned that Junior Brother Qin was in secluded cultivation,” Senior Brother Yu cupped his hands, smiling as he walked inside. “For a long time I hesitated on whether to visit so as not to interrupt your cultivation.”</p><p>“This distinguished guest has arrived, how could I not be honored, as your junior brother?!”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to create an ice seat and brew some tea. Gesturing, he said, “Brother Yu, please sit. My cave is humble and I hope Brother Yu won’t laugh at me.”</p><p>Yu Daiyue took stock of the cave, which only had a single ice bed, and shook his head in admiration. “Junior Brother Qin does not indulge in pleasures or let material goods disturb him. This is the mentality that a Cultivator should have; it’s no wonder your cultivation has grown so rapidly, surpassing your senior brother.”</p><p>Upon hearing Yu Daiyue say this, Qin Sang felt extremely troubled.</p><p>Ever since their encounter in the trial realm, Yu Daiyue has been convinced that Qin Sang’s strength had grown in leaps and bounds, and despite Qin Sang’s explanations, he remained skeptical, so Qin Sang no longer bothered to say much.</p><p>When Yu Daiyue sat down, he spoke straightforwardly, “Junior brother Qin, to avoid interrupting your cultivation, I’ll be blunt. I wonder if your destined spirit sword still needs to devour spirit wood?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. When they were at the Corpse Sect base, Yu Daiyue had said he would keep an eye out for spirit wood for him, and Qin Sang didn’t think he’d still remember.</p><p>“Many thanks to senior brother Yu for your concern. My destined spirit sword is quite a glutton, and spirit wood is naturally the more the better. If senior brother Yu has any superior spirit wood, this junior is willing to buy it at a high price. I certainly won’t disappoint senior brother Yu.”</p><p>Qin Sang had over ten thousand spirit stones on him, which should be enough to buy most spirit wood. As for better spirit wood, Yu Daiyue probably wouldn’t bear to sell it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Daiyue shook his head and said, “Junior brother Qin has misunderstood. I don’t have any spirit wood right now, but I know there’s a plant of underworld fire pan tong in the ancient ruins, so I’d like to invite junior brother Qin to return to the ancient ruins together.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s surprise, Yu Daiyue explained, “Junior brother Qin has been cultivating diligently, so he may not know yet…”</p><p>It turned out that after Qin Sang and the others left, Che Yutao and the others had requested help from several other Nascent Soul cultivators and had worked together to clear out the ancient ruins. This included a man with the surname Du whom they had met at the Yuanqing Pure Palace after using the ancient teleportation array. He had personally come from the Yuanging Pure Palace.</p><p>Only now did Qin Sang realize that this man was a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, one step away from Soul Formation. No wonder Che Yutao was so respectful toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang asked with concern, “Were senior uncle Che and the others able to save Old Man Dique and Daoist Xuanyu?”</p><p>Unfortunately, Yu Daiyue also did not know the details, but he did know that the situation at the ancient ruins had stabilized. Most of the fire spirit beasts had been killed, and the remaining ones couldn’t do much.</p><p>Of course, these fire spirit beasts were still very dangerous to Foundation Establishment cultivators, but as long as they traveled together and were careful, they shouldn’t encounter too much trouble.</p><p>Supposedly, some of the restrictions on the peaks had been damaged and were no longer as strong, making it more likely they could be cracked. Many people, like Yu Daiyue, had already gathered their companions and entered the ancient ruins to search for treasure.</p><p>“I discovered this underworld fire pan tong earlier. It’s just that I don’t have the strength to break the restriction on my own. Then the strange things happened at the ruins and I’ve had to delay until now.”</p><p>Chapter 275: An Invitation from Senior Brother Yu</p><p>An untouched herb garden, even if it doesn't hold any spirit herbs that can mend foundations, might still have other good things. It's worth a look.</p><p>Qin Sang's horde of Devil Corpses was completely destroyed, leaving only a few zombies.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to focus on nurturing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, hoping to restore it before his departure.</p><p>Firstly, the corpses of Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't easy to come by.  His previous attempts at "fishing" for them had only been successful once in a long while. Secondly, from a survival perspective, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman was far more valuable than the Devil Corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't yet determine the talisman's true power, but he guessed that after its restoration, activating it would allow him to move at speeds comparable to a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>In many dangerous situations, this would give him the ability to react calmly.</p><p>Holding the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang communicated with the Flood Dragon spirit within. He learned that its soul had been severely injured by the golden bell and further weakened by resisting the lava. It would take considerable time to recover.</p><p>The talisman's restoration would also accelerate the spirit's recovery.</p><p>Now that the Flood Dragon spirit had submitted to Qin Sang, he didn't fear any backlash after its full recovery.  Furthermore, the spirit wasn't a true Flood Dragon, but more akin to a tool spirit. Its primary function was to activate the talisman's speed and it lacked the power to assist in combat.</p><p>Having gained a deeper understanding of the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman through communication with its spirit, Qin Sang returned it to his dantian and channeled his spiritual power to envelop it.</p><p>As strands of spiritual energy flowed into the talisman, it radiated a brilliant light.  The faint roar of a Flood Dragon echoed as the two halves of the talisman drew together, the gap between them shimmering with a milky white light.</p><p>Clearly sensing the accelerated recovery of the talisman, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. He paused and shifted his attention to the bone fragment.</p><p>Mastering the *Void Imprint* and the *Soul Snatching Curse* was essential.  In addition, the *Demonic Sounds of the Heavens* contained several useful spells which Qin Sang intended to cultivate as well.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his divine sense into the bone fragment, his eyes closed tightly, and the cave fell silent.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, divine light flashing within. He shouted in a low voice, "Condense!"</p><p>Before him, an illusory square seal materialized.  The seal bore no inscription but was covered in mystical runes. Following Qin Sang's thoughts, the seal shrank dramatically and flew into the center of his forehead.</p><p>Within his soul space, the jade Buddha emitted a yellow light, and the Heart-Devouring Insect lay dormant just outside its glow.</p><p>The Void Imprint arrived and precisely enveloped the insect, sealing it. The insect's aura was suppressed to a minimum.</p><p>This persistent worry could finally be partially resolved.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a great weight lift from his chest, his body feeling lighter.  A smile appeared on his face as he diligently mastered the *Soul Snatching Curse* and other spells.  He then continued to nurture the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman while awaiting Yun Youzi's arrival.</p><p>Time passed quickly in cultivation, and a year soon went by.</p><p>The cave's restrictions were suddenly triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state. The talisman rotated slowly within his qi sea, the crack down its middle now a barely perceptible line. The Flood Dragon spirit had also recovered significantly, no longer as weak as before.</p><p>The talisman could now be used, albeit cautiously, offering speeds comparable to a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, it was still fragile and required careful handling.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang opened his eyes and swept his divine sense outwards. He was surprised to discover that the person outside his cave wasn't Yun Youzi, but Yu Daiyue.</p><p>What was he doing here?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled but couldn't turn him away. He deactivated the cave's restrictions, rose, and went to greet him.</p><p>"Senior Brother Yu, what brings you to my humble cave? Please, come in."</p><p>Qin Sang put on a welcoming smile and ushered Yu Daiyue inside.</p><p>"Knowing that Junior Brother Qin was in secluded cultivation, I hesitated for a long time before deciding to disturb you. I was afraid of interrupting your training," Yu Daiyue said with a bow as he entered.</p><p>"An honored guest graces my home, brightening my humble abode.  I'm overjoyed!"</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang conjured an ice chair and offered tea. Gesturing towards the seat, he said, "Senior Brother Yu, please be seated.  My cave is simple, please forgive its lack of amenities."</p><p>Yu Daiyue glanced around the cave, which contained only an ice bed, and shook his head, sighing, "Junior Brother Qin is not one for worldly pleasures, undisturbed by external distractions. This is the true mindset of a cultivator. No wonder your cultivation has progressed so rapidly, surpassing even mine."</p><p>Hearing Yu Daiyue's words, Qin Sang felt a pang of helplessness.</p><p>Ever since their encounter in the Trial Space, Yu Daiyue had been convinced of Qin Sang's rapid increase in strength. No matter how Qin Sang explained, Yu Daiyue remained skeptical, so Qin Sang simply stopped trying.</p><p>After Yu Daiyue sat down, he got straight to the point: "Junior Brother Qin, to avoid disrupting your cultivation, I'll be frank.  Do you still need spirit wood for your natal spirit sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Back at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's base, Yu Daiyue had mentioned keeping an eye out for spirit wood for him. He hadn't expected Yu Daiyue to remember.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Yu, for your concern. My natal spirit sword is quite the glutton. Spirit wood is always welcome. If Senior Brother Yu has any high-quality spirit wood, I'm willing to pay handsomely for it. I certainly won't disappoint you."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly confident that the over ten thousand spirit stones he possessed were enough to exchange for most spirit wood.  As for even better spirit wood, he figured Yu Daiyue wouldn't be willing to part with it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Daiyue shook his head. "Junior Brother Qin, you misunderstand. I don't have any spirit wood on hand. However, I know there's a Earthfire Pantong tree within the ancient cultivator's ruins.  That's why I wanted to invite you to return to the ruins."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's surprise, Yu Daiyue explained, "Junior Brother Qin, you've been diligently cultivating, so you may not know…"</p><p>It turned out that after they left, Che Yutao and the others had invited several more Foundation Establishment cultivators to help clear the ancient ruins. Among them was the Du cultivator they had met at the Upper Primordial Pure Palace via the ancient teleportation formation. He had come personally from the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang only now realized that this person was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, just one step away from Nascent Soul. No wonder Che Yutao was so respectful towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang ventured to ask, "Did Senior Uncle Che and the others manage to rescue Elder Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Yu Daiyue didn't know the details, only that the ancient ruins had stabilized, and most of the fire spirit beasts had been eliminated. The remaining ones posed no significant threat.</p><p>Of course, for Foundation Establishment cultivators, these fire spirit beasts were still quite dangerous. But as long as a few people entered together and remained cautious, they could manage.</p><p>It was said that some of the restrictions on the mountain peaks had been weakened by the upheaval and weren't as strong as before, increasing the chances of breaking them.  Many people, like Yu Daiyue, were gathering companions and entering the ancient ruins to search for treasures.</p><p>"I discovered the Earthfire Pantong tree earlier," Yu Daiyue said, "but I lacked the strength to break the restriction on my own. Then the upheaval in the ruins occurred, and the matter was put on hold until now."</p>
