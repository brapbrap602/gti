**Chapter 252: Moths in the Shadow**

They joined forces centered around Sikong Muyue to crack the seals on various peaks. The seal on this peak had clearly been under attack for a long time, and it was only now that it had been broken.
The moment the seal was broken, everyone on the Bagua let out a collective sigh of relief, their hearts heavy with exhaustion and a sense of awe. Even with so many of them working together and Sikong Muyue leading them, they had nearly failed to break through.
It was evident how powerful the surviving seals were. Thankfully, Sikong Muyue had stepped forward and gathered a team to break the seal together. Otherwise, they would have had to return empty-handed.
With the seal broken, an exquisite palace of carved railings and jade tiles was revealed within.
The treasure was in the palace. Some people's eyes lit up with greed, but none of them rushed in to seize it. Instead, they all sat down cross-legged and seized the opportunity to restore their spiritual energy.
Sikong Muyue was the only exception. She tapped the Bagua with her finger, and the remaining black and white energy transformed into a large hand that charged into the palace in a predatory manner.
Everything that stood in its way was smashed with brute force. In the blink of an eye, the palace fell into disrepair.
The large hand returned, clutching dozens of objects. There were weapons such as swords and daggers, magical artifacts such as mirrors, flutes, and towers, as well as several spiritual materials and jade bottles containing pills. Unfortunately, the pills were dim and had lost their spiritual energy.
Everyone emerged from their meditation and stared fixedly at the treasure in the large hand. However, they all suppressed their greed and waited for Sikong Muyue to distribute it.
Sikong Muyue's gaze swept over them. With a wave of her hand, she tossed aside some of the objects that no longer had any spiritual energy. She then grabbed a spiritual sword with her spiritual energy and said, "Yan Guang Sword, an extreme-grade spiritual artifact. Starting bid."
"One thousand low-grade spirit stones!"
"One thousand three…"
"I don't have enough spirit stones. I would like to offer Sea Rock Gold worth one thousand spirit stones in exchange… Is there anyone willing to accept…?"
…
Sikong Muyue auctioned off the treasures they had acquired one by one and then evenly divided the proceeds among everyone, including herself. No one objected, and the atmosphere was surprisingly harmonious.
It was only because she was a master at the Core Formation stage that she had such prestige and could quell such unruly people.
They seemed to have done this more than once. There was rarely any dispute, and they distributed the items with great efficiency. Then, they manipulated the Bagua to fly towards another seal.
Qin Sang and Elder Di Que looked up and watched this scene unfold.
Before Qin Sang entered the courtyard, Sikong Muyue had yet to appear.
Elder Di Que did not enter the four heavenly peaks and instead wandered around outside, which surprised Qin Sang. He had not expected Sikong Muyue to do the same.
Now it seemed that everyone who had entered the ancient cultivator's abode had flocked under Sikong Muyue's command. After all, with a master at the Core Formation stage leading them, they could safely and steadily receive a share of the treasure. Who wouldn't be happy about that?
Qin Sang noticed that Mu Yifeng and Yu Daiyue were among them, but Yun Youzi was not.
Elder Di Que's face grew increasingly unsightly. Finally, he snorted and shouted, "Follow me!"
Qin Sang did not know why Elder Di Que was so furious. Knowing that it was best not to provoke him, he quickly leaped after Elder Di Que. However, he saw that Elder Di Que was heading straight for the depths of the mountains, towards the four heavenly peaks.
Distance can be deceiving.
This worldly saying was equally applicable here. The four heavenly peaks rapidly grew larger in their field of vision. Before they had even approached them, Qin Sang could already feel their imposing aura.
Qin Sang did his utmost to keep up with Elder Di Que's speed. Just as they were about to reach the foot of the nearest peak, Elder Di Que paused. His gaze was sharp as a hawk's as he swept it over several peaks below.
Then, Elder Di Que pressed down with his palm, and a burst of Mystical Sound of a Thousand Illusions energy erupted from it. The area was silently enveloped, and then Elder Di Que emerged from the void and stepped onto one of the mountaintops. "Come out!" he commanded.
The mountain was deathly silent.
An impatient look crossed Elder Di Que's eyes. He stared at a cliff face on the mountain and coldly said, "Must this old man drag you out himself?"
As soon as he finished speaking, a layer of black light emerged from the cliff face, and a man stepped out from it.
Qin Sang recognized this man. His name was Ren Hong, and he was at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. He was from the Wind Thunder Sect.
The Wind Thunder Sect was on par with the Medicine King Sect and held a prominent position in Xuanlan Pass.
As Ren Hong walked out from the cliff, the black light automatically withdrew. Only then did Qin Sang realize that there was a seal on the cliff, and Ren Hong had already broken part of it.
"Ren Hong greets Senior!"
Ren Hong's expression flickered, but he did not dare to show any disrespect to Elder Di Que. He asked with doubt, "May I ask why Senior summoned me?"
Elder Di Que glanced at him and said indifferently, "You have already broken two layers of the three-layered seal here. It seems that you have some skill in the art of seals.

"However, the third level of restrictions is not simple. Unless you have reached the nascent soul stage, no matter how much knowledge you have, it will be impossible to break through."

Ren Hong gave a wry smile when he heard this, "Senior, you have an eye for a person. I have indeed tried many times, without being able to shake it a bit. I was about to give up. I don't know if you have the time, I am willing to help senior break the restriction and give all the treasures inside to you..."

"I wouldn't stoop so low as to take your things, a junior!"

Old Man Dique gave a cold snort, his tone softening slightly, "However, I am in need of some assistance for an urgent matter. If you promise me, I can help you break through the restriction, and all the treasures inside will be yours. Are you willing?"

Ren Hong was taken aback, he glanced at Qin Sang, who had been standing silently to the side, and said after pondering for a moment, "I do not know what Senior needs me to do. Is it inside or outside the house? It shouldn't take too long, right?"

Old Man Dique impatiently said, "Of course it's inside the house! After we leave the house, I can't be bothered with you!"

"This..."

Ren Hong hesitated for a moment and, as he saw that Old Man Dique's gaze had begun to turn unfriendly, gritted his teeth and made a decision, "I will definitely do my best to assist you, Senior. Please do us the honor of acting!"

Ren Hong had already learned the rules of the restrictions on the cliff, but unfortunately his strength was lacking and he could not break through. If Old Man Dique took action, it would naturally be easy as pie for him.

While Old Man Dique took action, he did not forget to conceal the surrounding area, not wanting anyone else to discover his presence.

Soon, the restrictions on the cliff silently disappeared, revealing a hidden cave. When Old Man Dique retracted his magic weapon, he stood with his hands behind his back and seemed to have no interest in the treasures in the cave.

Only then did Ren Hong breathe a sigh of relief and, after bowing to Old Man Dique, disappeared into the cave for a while before coming back out.

Afterwards, Qin Sang and Ren Hong, one to the left and one to the right, followed Old Man Dique as he continued to fly towards Heaven Peak.

Soon, three figures arrived at a celestial peak.

Old Man Dique landed at the foot of the mountain, looked around to the left and right and then suddenly darted towards an inconspicuous rock. A grey line shot out from under the rock.

It was an inconspicuous moth!

An illusionary moth!

When he saw that moth, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He had seen it before in the 御灵宗 atlas.

Illusionary moths are also strange insects. They are not as rare as fire jade centipedes, but they are also very scarce.

Illusionary moths do not have powerful abilities and they have short lifespans, just like ordinary insects. They have only one ability, which they have perfected, to blend into rocks and stones so well that they appear to be inanimate objects.

Even cultivators would find it difficult to notice them.
