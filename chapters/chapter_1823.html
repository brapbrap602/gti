<h1>Chapter 1814: Resolution</h1><p>A fierce poison entered his body.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively suppressed the power of the poison pearl, restraining his true energy and blood, offering almost no resistance.  He immediately felt discomfort.</p><p>Because this wasn't a genuine, original cultivation technique, many methods were unusable.  Lacking any buffer, Qin Sang directly endured the poison's impact.</p><p>His physique, comparable to a demon cultivator, could withstand it.  He quickly composed himself, exhaled a浊气 (zhuoqi - impure breath), and entered a meditative state.</p><p>His cultivation technique circulated, completing a cycle in an instant. His true energy enveloped the poison, and his breathing gradually calmed.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, raised his hands, and quickly formed a hand seal.  A peculiar fluctuation immediately arose within him.</p><p>This fluctuation was very strange. Transmitted through his true energy, it affected the poison, and gradually, the poison began to vibrate as well.</p><p>Through this fluctuation, Qin Sang gained initial control over the poison.  He changed the hand seal, and the poison immediately separated. A small amount of impurities were extracted, and the remainder transformed into the purest poison.</p><p>At this moment, the poison and Qin Sang's true energy were still distinctly separate, but showed signs of merging.</p><p>As time passed, the poison was gradually refined and integrated into his true energy.  This proved the method feasible, and the subsequent process went smoothly. Soon, all the ingested poison was refined.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a look of surprise.</p><p>Perhaps because the amount of poison he refined was still small, or perhaps because the technique was indeed as unique as he anticipated, Qin Sang’s true energy showed no signs of disorder.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed for a moment, then immediately activated the poison pearl, separating out more of the fierce poison to refine it repeatedly. In a short time, he achieved what had previously taken several days of arduous effort.</p><p>During the refinement process, Qin Sang also felt the lingering poison accumulating in his blood and bones.</p><p>If left untreated, it would certainly become a hidden danger.</p><p>Qin Sang drew out the residual poison, activating the poison-refining body-tempering secret technique. He mobilized the residual poison that had invaded his blood and bones. An even more intense pain surged through him, as if his entire body, including his marrow, was being scoured by a powerful poison, feeling as if his body would melt.</p><p>However, this level of pain couldn’t move Qin Sang.  He remained seated, unmoving, his internal energy surging to its peak before slowly subsiding.</p><p>After completing the exercise, Qin Sang looked thoughtful, reviewing the entire process of refining the poison and tempering his body.</p><p>When he internally examined his body, residual poison remained, though greatly reduced after double refinement. It was undeniably present, like a malignant tumor, deep within his bones, extremely difficult to remove.</p><p>When he first started cultivating, he could have removed it by breathing exercises, but it would have been time-consuming, defeating the purpose of rapid improvement. It was better to continue with normal cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the poison pearl and activated the detoxifying glow. As expected, it forced out more residual poison, much easier than using breathing exercises.</p><p>He concentrated his senses and felt that the residual poison was seemingly gone.</p><p>This showed the poison pearl's importance, at least in the initial stages of cultivation, mitigating the risks of the poison technique.</p><p>Through repeated attempts, various problems were verified, gradually progressing towards Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang opened his Qianjun Ring, from which a jade bottle flew out, containing a drop of flower dew.</p><p>According to the "Poison God Canon," flower dew is one of the most suitable poisons for cultivation: it’s easier to refine, and the amount of residual poison is less than with other potent poisons.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The jade bottle opened, and Qin Sang opened his mouth and sucked the flower dew into his stomach.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>It was like swallowing a ball of fire, immediately exploding within him. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, unexpectedly finding the toxicity so fierce, he hurriedly entered a meditative state.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the initial burst, the flower dew gradually calmed, and the refining process was very smooth, just as the “Poison God Canon” had described.</p><p>However, the resentment energy Qin Sang was most concerned about wasn't detected during the refinement of the flower dew.</p><p>“Is the effect gradual, even undetectable to me? Or…is the flower dew extremely pure, truly unaffected by resentment energy?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised. He thought for a moment, then took out the round pearl and opened its seal.</p><p>The pearl was like water. Qin Sang attempted to draw out the flower poison within, immediately triggering a violent reaction.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared and successfully extracted a strand of flower poison.</p><p>Compared to the flower dew, this strand of flower poison had already merged with the resentment energy and couldn't be separated.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the process, refining the flower poison, and immediately felt a difference.</p><p>Soundlessly, the resentment energy in the flower poison spread within his body, invading his Purple Mansion, seemingly attracted to his primordial spirit.  Qin Sang tried everything, but couldn't stop the resentment energy's invasion.</p><p>However, the resentment energy ultimately encountered an unbreachable wall and was blocked.</p><p>The resentment energy, unable to advance, lingered for a while before gradually dissipating.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly felt every shift in the resentful energy, nodding silently to himself, reassured about its impact.  However, its presence made refining the flower essence less smooth, leaving more residual toxins.  For cultivation, the flower essence remained the superior choice.</p><p>With all his questions answered, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief.  A look of weariness crossed his eyes; the whole process had been incredibly taxing. He slowly withdrew his cultivation, stood up, and left the cave.</p><p>Standing atop the mountain, he gazed at the surrounding hills and flower fields.  The vast world truly held wonders beyond imagination; who could have guessed such a unique flower existed, and that a hidden field of them lay deep within the mountain?</p><p>“The flower essence doesn't ripen all at once. I'll have to harvest it periodically, requiring frequent trips between locations...”</p><p>Qin Sang realized a crucial point: harvesting the essence couldn't be delegated; he had to do it himself.  Continuing his cultivation on Sword Heart Island was problematic, regardless of travel time.</p><p>The current situation was volatile. The Gui Fang nation was rapidly expanding its demonic influence in the Evil Plains, with the Daoist Court remaining inactive, a potential prelude to war.  The Evil Plains were no longer safe.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, a new idea forming.  Could he cultivate here permanently?  If other cultivators knew his plan, they would think him mad.</p><p>Entering the Evil Plains intensified the chaotic energy's erosion of the spirit.  It was said that deep within, even stabilizing true energy would prove futile—though most cultivators lacked the ability to reach such depths.</p><p>The location of his current cultivation site within the mountain wasn't deep enough; his true energy remained stable. Even a cultivator of Dong Xuan Zhenren's level would fear mental instability and wouldn’t dare stay for long.</p><p>But Qin Sang was not only unafraid; he found the idea increasingly ingenious. For him, it was the ideal spot to cultivate.  Hidden here, no one would disturb him.  As long as he remained, external turmoil would have no effect.</p><p>Gui Fang and the Daoist Court might clash near the mountain, but Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn’t dare enter.  In time, he’d connect the poisonous lake and the illusionary forest, relying on both locations to contend with any foe.</p><p>“Wait, I almost forgot about them…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered the Heaven-Eyed Butterflies and the Fire Jade Centipedes, nearly overlooked. He possessed the jade Buddha, but the insects relied on the mountain and the inner truth he visualized for protection.</p><p>“The butterflies can benefit from the jade Buddha to a degree, so they shouldn't be a problem. The inner truth I visualize also carries the Buddha's essence, surpassing any protective spirits.  But I wonder how long the centipedes can endure. Three or five years would be fine.  I can’t interrupt my alchemical pursuits.  I need to consult the Sword Master on the sword path, obtain the Bright Flower Pill for the butterflies... I'll have to return eventually to help them recover. Otherwise… should I ask someone else to care for them?”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the mountain and called out the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Over the past ten years, feeding on leftovers from the butterflies, the centipede had made significant progress.  If it successfully molted, it could almost keep pace with him; otherwise, it would become useless.</p><p>“Let's see your fate!” Qin Sang murmured, his decision made: his cultivation would be his priority.  Before that, he had to return to the mountain to handle some matters.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally listed his tasks, his hands continuously forming hand seals, not sparing materials as he refined formation devices, repairing the existing formations to the best of his ability.  This would be his cultivation grounds, and it deserved meticulous preparation.</p><p>After a flurry of activity, the spirit formations were renewed.  Qin Sang soared into the air, surveying the land with satisfaction. With a thought, he activated another layer of the array.</p><p>Beyond the boundary, toxic mist and violent winds intensified.  The outer poisonous waters were also affected, filled with turbulent currents, whirlpools, and dangerous poisonous restrictions, deterring any approach. Even Daoist Court officials would retreat at the sight, choosing to detour unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out more flags, layering them in place.  Even if someone infiltrated the poisonous lake, they would be lost and unable to find the hidden flower field.</p><p>Only after ensuring absolute safety did Qin Sang stop.  Looking at his cultivation grounds, he smiled. He chose the highest peak to create a new cave and set up multiple seals around the eye of the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the strange poison that killed the disciples of the Lougu Mountain was from this formation eye. Its potency was not to be underestimated. While it wouldn't erupt spontaneously, the conflict between the Daoist Court and Gui Fang might trigger the golden light, causing changes in the eye; precautions were necessary.</p><p>Beyond that, there were virtually no other changes.</p><p>Qin Sang took a moment to catch his breath, then swiftly left the spatial area.</p><p>The strange occurrences here were all caused by a spirit array, harmless to Qin Sang.  He moved quickly, not towards the exit of the Poison Lake, but deeper inside.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang reached the other side of the Poison Lake, his figure appearing at the edge.</p><p>"Hmm, there are actually vast auspicious clouds here…"</p><p>Qin Sang left the Poison Lake and found auspicious clouds separating the lake from the next illusion.</p><p>The moment he stepped into the clouds, a deafening roar of thunder filled his ears.  Passing through the clouds, he saw a pitch-black expanse ahead.</p><p>A boundless night, yet far from peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, lightning ripped through the darkness, like a fissure opening in the void, its power terrifying.</p><p>The instant the lightning appeared, Qin Sang, outside the illusion, felt a jolt to his heart, a sense of imminent danger.</p><p>Having received instruction from the High God of the Celestial Heavens and cultivated three types of lightning talismans, Qin Sang was acutely sensitive to the power of lightning. He confirmed that it wasn't real lightning, but far more dangerous.</p><p>The 'lightning' vanished instantly.  A long time passed before another bolt struck, with the same overwhelming power.</p><p>The rest of the time, the night remained eerily calm, a strange silence.</p><p>"I'll explore this later," Qin Sang mused.</p><p>There was plenty of time to cultivate in the Poison Domain.</p><p>This was one of Qin Sang's reasons for staying: to independently open a path to the depths of the Ritual Altar and await news from Mo Xingdao.</p><p>His return arrangements also primarily depended on Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Qin Sang spent some time observing the area before flying away.</p><p>The two True Persons were already on their way back.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the way he came, encountering no one until the entrance to the Ritual Altar. He then traveled alone through the Abyssal Wasteland, his journey unimpeded, soon reaching Mount Ju.</p><p>Back at Mount Ju, after a brief rest, Qin Sang headed straight for Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The island was covered with Sword Heart Orchids, vibrant with life; several pavilions nestled among the dense forest.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang appeared above Sword Heart Island, he alarmed the sword servant.</p><p>The servant flew swiftly into the air. Seeing Qin Sang, he exclaimed joyfully, "The True Person has returned safely!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  "Did Qingtan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren come by?"</p><p>The sword servant nodded repeatedly.  "Not long ago, the two True Persons visited the island, saying the True Person was in danger…"</p><p>As he spoke, the sword servant crushed a token, his joy evident. "The master isn't in the cave; he was about to gather people to rescue the True Person from the Abyssal Wasteland. Knowing the True Person is safe will surely make him very relieved."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He hadn't expected the Sword Master to go to such lengths for him.  After a moment of silence, he returned to the island with the sword servant.</p><p>Shortly after, a tearing sound came from outside the island, a streak of light speeding towards them.</p><p>Before seeing anyone, Qin Sang heard a hearty laugh, "My dear brother, indeed a lucky man!"</p><p>Before the words finished, three figures entered in succession.</p><p>The speaker was the Sword Master, followed by Bo Xian Shanren and Youhuang Zhenren.</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren looked somewhat exhausted.  Seeing Qin Sang, he looked relieved, bowing deeply. "It was we who caused trouble for the True Person. Fortunately! Fortunately!"</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren's beautiful eyes flickered, a smile playing on her lips. "What did I say? I told you Qingfeng Zhenren's abilities were extraordinary, beyond our comparison.  It's laughable how anxious you two True Persons were…"</p><p>She turned to Qin Sang. "When the Sword Master heard the bad news, he immediately contacted us, rushing around, sparing no expense to gather antidote treasures to rescue the True Person – alive or dead! If the True Person had returned any later, the antidote treasures on Mount Ju would have been completely depleted by us."</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren added, "Daoist Qingtan is currently traveling among the Daoist sects, and will soon be joining us."</p><p>Qin Sang, his expression serious, bowed deeply, his gratitude unspoken yet profound.</p><p>Indeed, adversity reveals true character.</p><p>It was clear that the Sword Master was the driving force.</p><p>Qingtan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren's relationship with him was casual. Without the Sword Master's insistence, they might not have been so dedicated.</p><p>"The path of cultivation is arduous; we cultivators should help each other. It's nothing to mention," the Sword Master patted Qin Sang on the shoulder.  "It's good you're back, brother. This ordeal might not be a bad thing."</p><p>They all sat down, and Qin Sang recounted his experiences.  He had prepared a narrative, and the True Persons' faces changed at the most perilous parts.</p><p>The Sword Master ordered the sword servant to hold a banquet for Qin Sang to calm his nerves.</p><p>By the time the banquet ended, it was late at night, and the two True Persons left.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Sword Master drank together under the moon.</p><p>"To be frank, senior brother, though it was extremely dangerous, it was also a fortunate encounter, greatly beneficial to my future cultivation. However, I won't be able to continue cultivating on Sword Heart Island; I need to leave for a long time."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>The Sword Master finished his cup of fine wine.</p><p>Fortunes of war were not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>He wasn't surprised, and didn't ask what the fortunate encounter was, only saying, "Just ask if you need anything, brother."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, smiling.  "I've always remembered our agreement to duel, senior brother. I will often return to visit you."</p>
