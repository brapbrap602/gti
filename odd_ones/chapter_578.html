      The difference between a Grade B and Grade A lay in the level of
                their lifeform. After entering Grade A, one’s genes would be
                optimized to become even more perfect. The body would become
                more adapted to the release of energy, and the energy loss would
                also be greatly reduced. At the same time, even the energy
                output would also be transformed. In layman’s terms, endurance
                and attack power would increase. Thus, Grade A was known as the
                Calamity Grade.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As its name suggested, as long as they released power, a Grade A
                Super would definitely be able to wreak havoc akin to a natural
                disaster on a planet in a short time frame. Before the emergence
                of Beyond Grade A Supers, Grade A was the strongest level in the
                Galaxy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Even then, Grade A remained a significant milestone.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In his previous life, the level of the players had at most
                reached Grade A, so Han Xiao was acutely aware that once someone
                passed through the threshold of Grade A, their strength would
                immediately experience a great improvement!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This was a new phase!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Currently, he was at Level 136, and his main class was at Level
                11. With excitement, he began to pump in his experience.

      At this level, there would not be able sort of easy missions
                given. Han Xiao glanced at it, and immediately knew that he
                would not be able to complete it in a short amount of time. He
                unhesitatingly used up the last Mission Completion Card, and the

      Out of the seven options, five of them belonged to the Void
                evolution system.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Void System was a rare evolutionary chain that was difficult
                to obtain. A normal Race Evolution would only have a small
                chance of drawing the chance to evolve in the direction of the
                Void System. Because Han Xiao had injected himself with the bone
                marrow of the Void Dragon and managed to obtain a portion of the
                Void Genes fragment, he had been able to draw the [Void Prowler]
                race in his previous evolution.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After becoming a [Void Prowler], his evolutionary chain had
                shifted from being part of the human race to being a branch of
                the Void System while retaining some of the characteristics of
                the human race. The Void System was a variant evolution and had
                a high degree of integration of many different species.
                Therefore, he was offered many evolution options, marked with
                the characteristics of ‘human form’.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Of course, he still had options that did not retain his human
                form, such as [Eye of the Void]. If he selected that, he would
                become a large eyeball with a tentacle attached to it. It would
                have an innate ability of Void Gaze, which could inflict Fear
                onto anyone.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [High Energy Entity] was another state of an energy life, where
                they existed as soul-based creatures, similar to that of a Lich.
                As long as their soul core was not damaged, the energy body
                could be repaired at any time even if it was destroyed. This was
                a species suitable for those who were Mages.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao naturally wanted to retain the potential evolutionary
                direction of his Void System. However, he also needed a human
                form to complete mechanical manufacturing. Some of his expertise
                could only be activated in human form, so only four of the Void
                Evolution options that preserved his human form would meet the
                requirements.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">

       I have a high level of tankiness, so I don’t need to worry

                  bonuses…

     </p>

     <p class="calibre5">
      An avalanche of pain exploded from deep within his body. Han
                Xiao had long prepared for it and gritted his teeth as he
                endured the pain that would make an ordinary person faint as he
                tried to feel the changes in his cells and genes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      His body uncontrollably phased in and out of its Void form, and
                his Void Vision flickered and disappeared constantly, as though
                looking through dozens of frames per second. This time, the pain
                in his brain was the strongest, and it was as though thousands
                of needles had stabbed into his head, giving him some sort of
                brain acupuncture.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The [Chaos Observer]’s attributes were biased toward
                Intelligence, which was one of his reasons for picking that
                route. The second reason was that Han Xiao recalled that this
                route would have a chance of evolving into a high-level Void
                Entity in the future, with more potential than the other three.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Luckily, the pain this time was not as severe compared to when
                he had evolved into the [Void Prowler]. Han Xiao was already
                considered a Void creature, and the reaction to changes in the
                genes was not so drastic.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Huu, huu…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After a long period of time, the pain gradually faded. Han Xiao
                took ragged breaths, covered in sweat as though he had just been
                dragged out from a lake. The world in his eyes was much clearer,
                and the thoughts in his brain spun much faster, like bubbles in
                boiling water.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After appreciating it for a few seconds, Han Xiao looked at the
                interface to access his new race talents.

      “Four talents!” Han Xiao’s face lit up. This was one more than
                Void Prowler provided.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After trying them all once, he got a rough idea of them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The one that he was most familiar with was the [Advanced Void
                Travel]. It was just an upgraded version of the original [Void
                Travel], lasting up to three minutes. The phasing was also
                increased, meaning that he could now phase longer distances and
                complete more things during that time. However, the cooldown
                remained at five minutes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The other three talents were the special talents of the [Chaos
                Observer], of which [Chaos Entity – Release] was the core. The
                other two required [Chaos Entity – Release] to be activated
                before they could be used.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The moment Han Xiao’s thoughts moved, his entire person suddenly
                dispersed, turning into a gray fog. This was a weird field of
                energy, where light was swallowed up by it, but it retained its
                gray color instead of being displayed as black.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was as though space was used as the canvas, with a touch of
                gray paint applied on it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In addition, his sensory organs also morphed along with his
                appearance. He no longer needed ‘eyes’ to see things, no longer
                needed ‘ears’ to hear things. The chaos fog provided him with
                sight, hearing, touch, smell, and more. In fact, its acuteness
                was increased many folds, and even his movements were no longer
                consistent with human actions. The chaos fog served as the core,
                drifting around, and could even shift into many shapes, akin to
                a cloud moving by itself. Its speed was quite fast and even had
                the ability to phase through walls.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Not only that, but the new sensory organs were hard to describe.
                Simply miraculous.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       This is a chaos body?
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought
                to himself before realizing that he did not have a brain
                anymore, so how could he think? After pondering for a while, he
                suddenly came to the realization that after forming a ‘chaos
                body’, he had technically changed from a physical lifeform into
                an energy field. Inside this field, the chaos fog constituted
                his organs and body parts at a microscopic level. It was
                precisely all these molecular and atomic structures that formed
                a circuit of thinking, conducted through bioelectricity.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Since he could create Artificial Intelligence, it was not
                surprising to have an alternative path of thinking.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He then tried out the other two talents. [Void Vision –
                Observer] utilized his chaos body that could phase between the
                void dimension and the physical world. This was unlike [Void
                Travel], where time was almost static. When he utilized this
                ability, time flowed as per normal, but he could hide within the
                gap to observe changes in the outside world and with a larger
                field of vision.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He could also place [Observer’s Mark], which was related to his
                new sense organs. As long as the markers were set around a
                certain person, place, or spatial coordinate, they could be
                observed across space synchronously, akin to a split screen mode
                with a maximum of five markers at any one time. The markers
                could also be replaced.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Wait a minute… this observation, this is simply akin to
                  voyeurism!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was rendered speechless.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Could it be that I’ve become a sentry ward‽
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       This is getting more and more ‘perverted’… I like it!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After turning into a chaos body, his interface was also
                refreshed accordingly, displaying the status of his
                ‘transformation’, which included a ninety-five percent immunity
                to damage. The energy possessed in his human form would turn
                into the HP level of the chaos body, meaning that energy was
                required to maintain this state. Most skills and abilities were
                frozen, but [Advanced Void Travel] would be greatly enhanced,
                and the cooldown reduced from five minutes to 15 seconds.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If the HP of the chaos body was fully depleted, it would force
                the human form to take shape once again. However, his energy
                would be completely depleted, and there would be a negative
                status of [Severe Injury]. At the same time, [Chaos Entity –
                Release] would enter a forty-eight-hour cooldown period.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       This also means that the chaos body does not have much combat
                  capability and is mainly used for its observation and
                  scouting. It’s an auxiliary function.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Deactivating the [Chaos Entity – Release] skill, the fog rolled
                and shrank toward the center, condensing back into a human body.
                The color of his skin regained its original human-like color as
                Han Xiao returned to his normal shape.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Taking out a mirror, Han Xiao took a look. This time, it was not
                his wishful thinking, but he seemed to have grown more handsome.
                In addition, he had grown taller. His eyes in particular were
                breathtaking, giving people a mysterious urge to dig them out.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Those were the changes brought about by the Race Evolution. In
                his interface were more notifications.

      A special rank bonus was a privilege one could only obtain when
                they arrived at Grade A. With the baseline of 10,000 Ona for
                their energy level as a gauge, for every 10,000 Ona increased,
                they would receive a new rank bonus. However, the distance from
                Grade A to Beyond Grade A was still too far apart.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Within the Grade A range, it was also divided based on strength.
                The easiest way was just to compare one’s combat capability or
                to distinguish the difference in level, attributes, skills, and
                expertise. A Grade A+ Super could easily deal with a newly
                promoted Calamity Grade Super, probably even steamroll them.

      These were the two exclusive talents that would only be awakened
                when one reached Grade A. Of which, the skill [Superhuman] was
                fixed, and the other skill would suit one’s profession. Han Xiao
                had played a few different professions previously, so he was
                quite clear on this.

      [Mechanical Force Field]: When you apply a Mechanical Force
                bonus, a machine will be used as the center point, forming a
                force field around it. Machinery within this range will randomly
                have a 40 – 80% bonus effect (non-stackable), which only
                consumes the strength of one machine. The range of said force
                field is dependent on one’s Intelligence attribute.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">

     <p class="calibre5">
      This was an ability limited to Mechanics, which would serve as
                one of the core skills of the Army Style. Just by adding another
                machine, without a change in consumption, the surrounding
                machines would be able to enjoy a bonus effect, enhancing their
                longevity on the battlefield. Using the language of players, it
                was called a ‘splash effect’.

                equipment, mechanical creations, summoned entities, and other
                means of combat that you possess). The bonus effect depends on
                the character’s total Level.

      Thus, his current ability strength increase was thirty-two
                percent.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If the previous ability was meant to increase one’s stamina and
                endurance on the battlefield, [Superhuman] was the main reason
                for the great increase in damage dealt by Calamity Grade Supers.
                The ability strength was basically equivalent to one’s attack
                power.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This bonus was independent of all talents and skills. No matter
                how high one’s attack power was, it would take that as the base
                and increase in percentage based on that.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The stronger one’s attack, the greater the increase.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The higher one’s level, the greater the bonuses.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This explained the terrifying attack power that Ames had
                displayed the other time. Of course, the main reason was also
                because Floating Dragon was durable enough.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With all the notifications having come to an end, Han Xiao used
                his remaining experience to improve his [Mechanical Force Field]
                skill, raising it another two levels, before allocating all his
                free attribute points to Intelligence.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Having reached Level 140, the experience consumption was even
                greater. Just rising two levels required nearly two billion
                experience. If Han Xiao only used the mission rewards given at
                Version 2.0 as the standard experience gain, then God only knew
                when he would next be able to level up.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The players’ mission rewards naturally rose with the versions.
                At that level, experience reward would start from tens of
                million at the very least.

      Filling his body full of a surging strength, Han Xiao revealed
                an expression of excitement as he clenched his fists. He felt as
                though he could now destroy Harmon with just one punch.

      Looking at his interface, he observed the overall changes that
                had occurred.
