<h1>Chapter 1237: The Spirit-Fixing Jade</h1><p>The creation of the Nascent Soul puppet involved a demonic soul-refining technique, inherently making it an evil puppet.  Even true Nascent Soul cultivators, unless they achieve the realm of spirit body transformation, risk having their primordial spirit devoured by the puppet’s spirit, causing damage.</p><p>Initially, this damage was manageable, and the puppet master could recover with time and cultivation.  Compared to the power of a Nascent Soul-level combatant, this cost was insignificant.</p><p>Furthermore, the Upper Clarity Palace discovered an astonishing use for the puppet.  Due to the limited records left by their ancestor, it remained unclear whether it was due to the materials, a secret technique used in its creation, or a combination thereof, but an unforeseen effect emerged.  </p><p>All primordial spirits devoured by the puppet left behind a soul imprint, eternally trapped within.  Golden Core disciples could sense these Nascent Soul imprints, gaining a taste of the Nascent Soul realm during their Golden Core stage.  The benefits were obvious, significantly increasing the chance of breaking through cultivation bottlenecks.</p><p>However, obtaining this experience was perilous.  The puppet dared to devour even the souls of Nascent Soul cultivators, let alone Golden Core cultivators.  A single misstep meant complete soul absorption and eternal damnation.</p><p>The true power of the puppet's ability only manifested after the Upper Clarity Palace obtained the method for creating the Inner View Spirit Talisman.  The Palace flourished for a time.</p><p>Elder Di Que’s plot against Daoist Xuan Yu, aiming to seize the Inner View Spirit Talisman, stemmed from his belief that it aided Nascent Soul formation. He was mistaken; the puppet was the key, with the talisman only playing a supporting role. However, the talisman did help in overcoming the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>The talisman's true function was to create an inner view space within the cultivator's Purple Mansion, protecting their primordial spirit.  Its creation required a cultivator to begin refining it at the Foundation Establishment stage, demanding immense effort, continuous spiritual energy nurturing, until the peak of the Golden Core stage. As such, only the creator could use it; upon the creator's death, the talisman would self-destruct, making it impossible for others to take.</p><p>Even without Qin Sang’s interference, Elder Di Que wouldn't have obtained the talisman. Upper Clarity Palace disciples refined the talisman, reaching the peak of the Golden Core stage and facing the Nascent Soul tribulation, perfectly positioned to utilize the puppet within the talisman's protection.</p><p>Although refining the talisman was challenging, the allure of Nascent Soul cultivation meant nearly every disciple possessed one.</p><p>However, things changed. A catastrophic event wiped out the Palace's Nascent Soul cultivators, leading to a steep decline.  Faced with imminent destruction, a peak Golden Core disciple took charge, deploying the puppet against the invaders.</p><p>The battle was brutal.  The disciple successfully repelled the enemy but discovered his primordial spirit had been partially devoured by the puppet, rendering Nascent Soul cultivation impossible. His incomplete spirit meant he'd never reach Nascent Soul, even if he survived, possibly impacting any future reincarnation.</p><p>Eventually, the Upper Clarity Palace produced a new Nascent Soul ancestor, improving the situation.  But as the puppet devoured more souls, the cost of using it grew steeper, becoming unbearable even for the ancestor.</p><p>A late Nascent Soul cultivator from the Palace, renowned across the Northern Star region for their mastery of spirit body transformation, attempted to refine the countless soul imprints within the puppet, resolving the issue.  They discovered the sheer number of souls, a horde of vengeful spirits, made it impossible. While they could still barely control the puppet, refining the souls resulted in a devastating backlash.</p><p>Now, the situation is worse.  The risk of experiencing the Nascent Soul imprints has become too great. Even with the Inner View Spirit Talismans, modern disciples dare not attempt it, leaving the puppet sealed away, a deterrent against external threats, awakened only in times of dire need.</p><p>Otherwise, how could Shangyuan Quiet Palace have gone so long without producing a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>As for the Inner Scene Primal Talisman, while its effects are unique, its allure has greatly diminished.  Furthermore, its refinement process is lengthy and consumes excessive cultivation time. Only disciples of exceptional talent choose to cultivate this secret talisman.</p><p>Successive Palace Masters of Shangyuan Quiet Palace have all been carefully chosen, direct disciples raised from childhood. They are benevolent individuals, always ready to sacrifice themselves for their sect.</p><p>The previous Palace Master, Tie Guanzi, was forced to use a Nascent Soul puppet once.</p><p>He made a desperate gamble, viewing Purple Micro Palace as his last hope, and perished there.</p><p>Gong Liangyu brought the Nascent Soul puppet out this time to help him find the Blood Ginseng; he certainly doesn't want to give up on achieving Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His reliance is the jade pendant – the Soul-Stabilizing Jade.</p><p>The Soul-Stabilizing Jade is an ancient treasure he found by chance.  Similar in function to the Inner Scene Primal Talisman, its power far surpasses it, though it can only be used once.</p><p>Relying on this treasure to pass the Nascent Soul tribulation should ensure success, but he hasn't even passed the Soul Condensation stage, let alone the tribulation.</p><p>Gong Liangyu was willing to use the Soul-Stabilizing Jade to obtain the Blood Ginseng.</p><p>However, he was extremely anxious and deeply fearful of the Nascent Soul puppet, uncertain if the Soul-Stabilizing Jade could fully protect him.</p><p>After all, even Nascent Soul masters who controlled puppets could have their primordial spirits devoured.</p><p>“Excellent treasure! Excellent treasure!”</p><p>Gong Liangyu exclaimed repeatedly, his face filled with delight.</p><p>He was praising the Soul-Stabilizing Jade.</p><p>The wisp of Azure Spirit Light sealed within the Soul-Stabilizing Jade was of unknown origin. It firmly protected his primordial spirit, leaving it unharmed despite the Nascent Soul puppet's relentless attacks.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet, receiving no benefit, became increasingly frenzied.</p><p>Seeing this, Gong Liangyu knew time was short. He had to find the Blood Ginseng before the Azure Spirit Light dissipated.  Without hesitation, he made a hand gesture, pointing towards the Blood River, "Go!"</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet's sinister laughter deepened; its expression seemed somewhat reluctant, but ultimately it obeyed Gong Liangyu's command and plunged into the Blood River.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Gong Liangyu let out a long sigh of relief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>Stared at by the Nascent Soul puppet's crazed eyes, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>This puppet was capable of fighting a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, two levels above him.  Its obedience was already extraordinary.</p><p>If it weren’t for his trust in the sect's inherited secret arts, Gong Liangyu would never have dared to attempt this.</p><p>The Blood River wasn't filled with water, but with extremely thick blood mist.</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet charged into the Blood River.</p><p>The puppet led the way; Gong Liangyu quickly followed.</p>
