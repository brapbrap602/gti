<h1>Chapter 1541:  Black Hair (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1541:  Black Hair (4k)</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's cultivation was already at the peak of mid-Nascent Soul stage, only a step away from the late Nascent Soul stage.  </p><p>At this moment, he possessed the formidable strength comparable to a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>This secret technique was essentially a mutually destructive method.  After the technique's duration ended, Venerable Chengyuan would need decades of seclusion to recover.</p><p>Yet, he didn't hesitate to use it.</p><p>His opponent had two equally powerful experts.</p><p>Reinforcements couldn't arrive in time.</p><p>The temple's protective formation primarily defended against external enemies. Since the opponent had already succeeded, they would undoubtedly focus on escaping, greatly reducing the formation's effectiveness.</p><p>The relic was formed from the failed breakthrough attempt of Grandmaster Hongyi, making its purpose easy to guess.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan had been stuck at the late Nascent Soul bottleneck for many years, unable to find a way forward. The relic's significance to him was self-evident, and it couldn't be lost.</p><p>He was willing to pay any price!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was a highly accomplished monk; spending decades in silent meditation was common for him. His unwavering resolve was unparalleled in the world; few external factors could disturb his thoughts.</p><p>However, at this moment, Venerable Chengyuan's face was filled with killing intent, his eyes like knives.</p><p>The relic was related to a crucial path of cultivation.</p><p>Once missed, he might be forever stuck at his current level.</p><p>A cultivator encountering such an opportunity would undoubtedly fight to the death, holding nothing back!</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his focus from the relic to Venerable Chengyuan. Sensing the change in Venerable Chengyuan's aura, his gaze darkened slightly, realizing he had encountered a formidable foe.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>With a rapid flapping of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang moved with fluid grace, transforming into a streak of lightning, instantly fleeing the pagoda forest towards the temple's exterior.</p><p>Although his escape speed was fast, it couldn't match Venerable Chengyuan's ability to teleport using the formation.</p><p>Having just crossed the vast bamboo forest behind the Zhuban Temple, Qin Sang saw a distortion in the space ahead, and Venerable Chengyuan's figure appeared out of thin air, instantly blocking his path.</p><p>Before Venerable Chengyuan's figure fully solidified, a blade of light suddenly erupted.</p><p>The blade originated from Venerable Chengyuan's heart.</p><p>It was only four fingers long, shaped like a bird's feather, thin as silk.</p><p>This was his ceremonial knife!</p><p>Also his life-bound treasure.</p><p>The ceremonial knife.  A knife of precepts.</p><p>In Venerable Chengyuan's hands, it was an absolute killing weapon.</p><p>While in secluded meditation at the cliff face, Venerable Chengyuan's hands had long been free from bloodshed.  The sheathed knife, like a tiger in a cage, though its ferocity was suppressed, the killing intent within Venerable Chengyuan's heart had been infused into the knife's essence over the years.</p><p>Once unsheathed, the blade's light split the sun.</p><p>A chilling aura filled the air, a sorrowful wind swept through the path!</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was completely filled by this ceremonial knife; the sun seemed to be split in two.</p><p>It was already late autumn.</p><p>Influenced by the killing intent, the surrounding area felt even colder, as if plunged into midwinter.</p><p>"Not a pseudo-spiritual treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression calm.</p><p>Sensing the knife's aura, he determined it to be a top-grade treasure.</p><p>Perhaps it was a special advantage of Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that many Buddhist cultivators in the Western Desert had stronger spiritual senses than cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Venerable Chengyuan's spiritual sense had reached the formative stage, capable of practicing the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*, but the ceremonial knife's power was still limited to that of a mere treasure.</p><p>This showed that the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*, a secret method for nurturing pseudo-spiritual treasures, wasn't common in the Central Plains, and certainly not widely known in the Western Desert.</p><p>After encountering the Eight Scenery cultivator, Qin Sang had thought that except for the Sun God Tree, his other treasures wouldn't have much of an advantage in the Central Plains. Therefore, he overestimated Venerable Chengyuan's strength and did not act rashly.</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Venerable Chengyuan focused on his breakthrough and didn't want to be distracted, as cultivating the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique* required significant effort.</p><p>Cultivators prioritized realm; this time would be better spent seeking a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>Regardless, without a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even if Venerable Chengyuan were a true Grand Cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't fear him, especially one whose power was forcibly boosted.</p><p>"Excellent swordsmanship!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, the demonic banner in front of him fluttering wildly.</p><p>The blade shot towards him, Qin Sang locked onto by the ceremonial knife.</p><p>Although it was only a top-grade treasure, Venerable Chengyuan had nurtured the blade's intent for countless years, and the ceremonial knife's first unsheathing was far from ordinary and should not be underestimated.</p><p>For other mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, one misstep, and they might be split in two by the blade.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight throbbing pain between his brows, with the feeling that he might be cleaved in two.</p><p>His expression remained calm, he stopped his escape, and unleashed the demonic fire!</p><p>The black demonic fire transformed into a black cloud; wherever the flames spread, rocks and bamboo forests turned to ashes.</p><p>The demonic flames retracted, transforming into a fiery dragon that soared into the sky, directly attacking the ritual knife!</p><p>For decades,  Storm Belt had almost exclusively cultivated the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique. Qin Sang's spiritual awareness had greatly increased, allowing him to control a greater quantity of demonic fire, amplified by the Fire Lotus. Consequently, the power of the demonic flames had skyrocketed.</p><p>Elder Chengyuan felt a chill run down his spine upon sensing the fiery dragon's power.</p><p>With a ‘whoosh!’, the blade sliced into the demonic fire dragon, piercing from its head to its abdomen.</p><p>The thin ritual knife was incredibly sharp.</p><p>The upper half of the demonic fire dragon was severed, the tail remaining attached, forming a two-headed black serpent.</p><p>However, the knife intent was significantly diminished after cleaving through the demonic fire.  Qin Sang quickly spread his wings, simultaneously performing the Heart Knot Lotus Seal, dodging the attack.</p><p>“A pseudo-spiritual treasure!”</p><p>Elder Chengyuan exclaimed, his fingers moving like spinning wheels as he rapidly formed a hand seal.</p><p>Instantly, the mountaintop was filled with swirling winds.</p><p>The temple's protective formation descended, showering the area with golden light.</p><p>As the saying goes, speed is paramount in battle.</p><p>If the Zhuban Temple monks had been able to quickly form their ranks and jointly control the protective formation to reinforce Elder Chengyuan, the pressure on Qin Sang would have dramatically increased.</p><p>However, from the moment Qin Sang and Liuli engaged, only a fleeting moment had passed.  The monks of Zhuban Temple were scattered throughout the temple, attending to their individual tasks. Even with their rigorous training, they couldn't match the speed of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>The disciples responsible for guarding the formation could only maintain its basic defensive capabilities, creating a golden dome covering the temple.  The speed at which they could change the formation's configuration was far too slow for the unfolding battle.</p><p>Knowing the urgency of the situation, the monks, faces filled with anger, raced towards the back mountain.</p><p>For now, Elder Chengyuan had to multitask, personally controlling the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, seeing the brilliant golden light, a golden rain descending like countless needles. Feeling the pressure, he immediately activated the Wish-fulfilling Treasure Pearl to strengthen his protective shield.</p><p>Simultaneously, he changed his hand seals, the demonic flames rising to form a black cloud above him.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Golden light rained down like arrows, covering the sky and earth.</p><p>Flames flickered within the black cloud, showing signs of dispersal.</p><p>Elder Chengyuan pressed his attack, his ritual knife trembling as he prepared to strike again. Suddenly, he heard two strange sounds, "hum ha," that shook his very soul.</p><p>“Child's play!”</p><p>A surge of blood flushed Elder Chengyuan's withered face as he roared, the sound of bells emanating from his body, bell shadows flickering around him, though smaller than before, covering only his head and shaking rapidly.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang possessed formidable spiritual awareness, a powerful foe unlike any he’d encountered before, and thus needed to guard against attacks on his soul.</p><p>This bronze bell was a defensive treasure; it not only protected his body, but its sound possessed special power to shield his soul.</p><p>The bell's sound dispelled the "hum ha" sounds, significantly weakening the soul-capturing incantation. Moreover, Elder Chengyuan's own powerful spiritual awareness meant he suffered minimal damage.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't hoped to seriously injure Elder Chengyuan with the “Soul Capturing Incantation.”</p><p>His goal was to create an opportunity for Liuli!</p><p>While Elder Chengyuan's soul was under attack, Liuli arrived, using the same tactic: the icy soul light silently spread beneath Elder Chengyuan, then suddenly exploded.</p><p>Unfortunately, the opponent was a seasoned top-tier expert; the same trick was unlikely to work twice.</p><p>Elder Chengyuan, anticipating Liuli’s move, evaded the soul capturing incantation and instantly shifted his position, causing the icy soul light to miss its target.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed.</p><p>Years of studying Zhuban Temple's protective formation hadn't been in vain.</p><p>Using his Heavenly Eye ability to sense the changes in the formation's energy, he could roughly determine Elder Chengyuan's new location. He immediately manipulated the demonic fire, changing its direction and sending it towards an empty space.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting; such judgments were prone to error, and the dispersed demonic fire lacked power.</p><p>Elder Chengyuan reappeared at the edge of the demonic fire's range, his ritual knife swirling around him, delivering dozens of rapid strikes.  Streams of energy bloomed like lotuses, pushing back the nearby flames.</p><p>Simultaneously, Elder Chengyuan chanted a Buddhist prayer, performing a single-handed earth-touching mudra. A golden ring suddenly erupted from the ground.</p><p>The golden ring appeared precisely beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>This was Elder Chengyuan's solution, conceived after witnessing Qin Sang's strength—a trap to secure the relic. He had secretly channeled most of the protective formation's power to this point.</p><p>Once entangled by the golden ring, Qin Sang would be trapped, requiring considerable effort to escape.</p><p>By then, reinforcements had arrived.  The masters from various temples joined forces, cornering the two thieves within the Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Jin Huan soared, swift as lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed at a loss, his brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable slightly tilted his ceremonial knife, aiming it at Liuli to prevent the Daoist nun from intervening, while simultaneously focusing his energy on the spirit array to imprison Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, a blinding flash of cold light erupted from Liuli's position.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable caught a glimpse of a strangely shaped small seal, his heart sinking.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Under the cold sun, the serpent revived.</p><p>The roar echoed across the oasis.  The devout people, hearing the sound, looked up at the sky in terror.  A monstrous creature, clawing and gnashing its teeth, tore through the golden light, its appearance malevolent and terrifying.</p><p>The Buddha within the golden light disappeared, seemingly swallowed whole by the monster.</p><p>Tears flowed, wails filled the air.</p><p>The four-headed serpent seal, given to Liuli, had been refined for many years and recognized her as its master.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation was inferior to Tong Lingyu's, but in her hands, the spiritual treasure seemed even more powerful, and she showed no strain.  This highlighted the significant difference between a spiritual treasure recognizing its master and the *Tongbao Jue* (Treasure Scripture).</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The serpent lunged downwards.</p><p>“A true spiritual treasure!”</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable could no longer maintain his composure, his heart trembling as he exclaimed.</p><p>True spiritual treasures were exceedingly rare, even in the Central Plains.  Their refinement was incredibly difficult, and even if someone managed to cultivate a natal treasure to the level of a spiritual treasure, upon the owner's death, the treasure's spirit would vanish, reverting to a mere magic item, incapable of being inherited.</p><p>Where did this wicked pair come from?</p><p>One possessed mysterious powers and controlled a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The other's escape techniques and spiritual perception were on par with great cultivators, wielding a counterfeit spiritual treasure.</p><p>Such individuals were rare even among the top sects of the Central Plains. When did these two top experts appear in the cultivation world?</p><p>The serpent's ferocity, its cold flames licking at their faces.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable, no longer concerned about Qin Sang, quickly moved to avoid the attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the serpent abruptly changed direction, neglecting Qin Sang and instead joined forces with the demonic fire, charging towards the protective dome overhead in front of horrified onlookers.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Golden light shot into the heavens.</p><p>The mountains seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The oasis lake was stirred into an unprecedented, colossal wave.</p><p>Demonic fire and cold flames raged, an endless inferno indistinguishable.</p><p>The monks operating the spirit array, still following Chengyuan Venerable's instructions to imprison Qin Sang with the golden ring, were too slow to react.</p><p>They watched helplessly as a crack was torn in the temple's protective array from within.</p><p>The golden ring, disrupted by the shockwave, weakened, revealing a flaw.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, a shout echoed from outside the temple.</p><p>“Senior Brother Chengyuan, Kongyu is here to assist!”</p><p>The booming voice grew steadily louder, approaching rapidly.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable.</p><p>A high monk from Luoluo Temple, one of the Seven Stars of the Hanhai, a mid-Yuan Ying stage expert.  Luoluo Temple's name was somewhat unusual, derived from the Luoluo tree, a unique spiritual tree of the Hanhai region.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was in the east of the oasis, and Luoluo Temple was to its east, the closest of the six great temples.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable was indeed the first to arrive.</p><p>His voice, amplified by his true energy, was deafening.</p><p>A moment later, an old monk clad in a kasaya appeared above Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable, holding a purple-gold alms bowl in his left hand, his gaze piercing, immediately noticed the crack in the protective dome.  With a flick of his wrist, he prepared to seal the fissure with the bowl.</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind struck from the side – the Jincheng Sword.</p><p>From the beginning, Qin Sang’s external manifestation had remained outside the temple, firstly to intercept reinforcements, preventing them from arriving too quickly, and secondly, to be ready to cooperate from within and break the array.</p><p>The treasure acquisition had gone more smoothly than anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't even needed the Solar God Tree.</p><p>There's another one outside!</p><p>The Zhulan Temple monks, seeing Kongyu Venerable's arrival, had their hope reignited only to be dashed once more.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable laughed angrily.</p><p>Three mid-Yuan Ying stage experts focusing their attention on little Zhulan Temple. He didn’t know whether to be furious or honored.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword energy approached.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable, unprepared for another enemy lurking outside the temple, was startled.  He hastily turned his alms bowl towards the sword energy, emitting purple-gold light.</p><p>With a ‘dong’, the sword light was engulfed by the purple-gold light, the Jincheng Sword's momentum checked. Kongyu Venerable’s body trembled, moving hundreds of feet sideways.  Though unharmed, he could no longer defend the temple.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two figures flashed from the fissure.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the oasis.</p><p>The boundless sand sea.</p><p>A few Bodhi trees stood alone in the yellow sand, offering meager shade to passing monks.</p><p>At that moment, a figure sat cross-legged beneath the Bodhi trees.</p><p>The person, wearing a hat that concealed their face, was yet adorned in celestial robes and ornaments, appearing as a Bodhisattva incarnate – the renowned Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>Monks surrounded them.</p><p>Seeing Moonlight Bodhisattva’s audacious attire, the younger monks were incensed.</p><p>Venerables Chengzhen and Guanhui remained unaffected, their debate on scriptures fervent.</p><p>At the height of the argument.</p><p>Venerable Chengzhen suddenly fell silent, lowering his head in surprise.  The jade ornaments at his waist clattered, snapping in two.  The monks, hearing the sound, fell silent, their expressions grim.</p><p>Something has happened at the temple!</p><p>“So, are these venerable monks about to concede defeat? Then leave behind the scriptures from your temple's library.”</p><p>Moonlight Bodhisattva, oblivious to the situation, chuckled faintly, their voice ethereal.</p>
