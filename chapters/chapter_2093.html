<h1>Chapter 2084: All in Motion</h1><p>Chapter 2085: All in Motion</p><p>Saint Mu Plain, Sacred Lake, Clan Leader's Residence.</p><p>Min Zhuo, the clan leader of the Changyou clan, held a sealed letter from Minshan, lost in thought.</p><p>Min Shu, Min Zhuo's third son, waited outside the private chamber for instructions.</p><p>Since the mysterious person delivered the message, Min Zhuo had ordered the clan to maintain its strategic posture toward the outsiders, but he demanded immediate reports of any significant actions by them.</p><p>Yesterday, a message arrived from the general on Minshan. Min Shu considered the matter important and presented it to Min Zhuo for decision.</p><p>Min Shu looked at the wooden door of the private chamber, his mind uneasy.</p><p>Since that encounter, the mysterious person had not reappeared.  However, Min Shu had sensed a change in his father's attitude towards the outsiders.</p><p>His usually decisive father was unusually hesitant and cautious, as if holding back something.</p><p>Though his father remained secretive, Min Shu had a hunch.</p><p>The Changyou clan was a tiny tribe within the Zhuyan territory, insignificant in the Celestial Department, let alone among the entire outsider population.  The clan possessed nothing that would attract the attention of a Level 2 Void Realm expert.</p><p>The most likely explanation was the exposure of the Azure Spirit Qi!</p><p>In outsider legends, the Foul Lands were a place of death, the final resting place of the deceased, a place both revered and feared. But it also birthed treasures beyond compare. This Azure Spirit Qi was unprecedented.</p><p>His father confirmed the Azure Spirit Qi's power diminished with cultivation level, making it useless for breakthrough to Level 2 Void Realm.  Thus, it might be of little value to the top clans.  However, for most tribes, a Level 1 Void Realm cultivator was a crucial pillar.</p><p>Min Shu couldn't fathom why the mysterious person hadn't seized the Azure Spirit Qi directly. He felt a deep unease about their plans.</p><p>After a while, Min Shu sensed a subtle fluctuation.  Expecting his father to emerge, he prepared to bow, only to find the chamber sealed by a formation.</p><p>Surprised, Min Shu dared not leave and continued to wait.</p><p>Inside the chamber.</p><p>Min Zhuo sealed the chamber and produced a jade bead, a look of hesitation on his face.</p><p>The bead was a gift from the mysterious person after Min Zhuo received the Jade Sun Milk. Activating it with his true energy would allow direct contact.</p><p>He hesitated, then resolutely poured his true energy into the bead.  With a "pop," it exploded into a mist of water, from which a blurry, ethereal figure slowly emerged.</p><p>Min Zhuo stood respectfully before the mist and said, "Forgive this intrusion, senior."</p><p>Despite the hazy mist, Min Zhuo felt as though a pair of eyes were watching him across vast distances, making him nervous.</p><p>Using the bead in the Sacred Grounds was partly a test. He didn't expect the other party to bypass the Sacred Lake's influence and appear so readily.</p><p>"Have you completed that secret technique?"</p><p>The mysterious person's voice was faint.</p><p>Min Zhuo guessed the Sacred Lake still affected the mysterious person, but relying on the lake to counter him was impossible.</p><p>He bowed deeply, "I've grasped nine-tenths of it, but several aspects elude me. I humbly seek your guidance."</p><p>This secret technique, combined with the Jade Sun Milk, would greatly enhance his cultivation. The technique and milk promised unprecedented progress.</p><p>At least, it seemed so.</p><p>The mysterious person hummed, and after Min Zhuo's question, offered some guidance.</p><p>His doubts resolved, Min Zhuo grew even more cautious, his face expressing gratitude, "Thank you for your guidance, senior!"</p><p>"This treasure's effect is limited.  Do you have other matters? Don't hesitate."</p><p>The mysterious person seemed to see through Min Zhuo's thoughts.</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but his expression remained unchanged, "Senior, I have a matter I hesitated to disturb you with. It involves those outsiders, and the situation is...strange. I hesitate to act without guidance."</p><p>"Tell me," the mysterious person showed interest.</p><p>"I previously appointed a general to command the troops on Minshan to deter the outsiders. Recently, he received a defector, a high-ranking outsider who provided some informationâ€¦"</p><p>Min Zhuo recounted the events.</p><p>Originally, after receiving that intelligence, Minshan, with a try-it-out mentality, made a few attempts. Unexpectedly, the intelligence proved accurate, catching Beihai completely off guard.</p><p>Of course, for now it's only a small-scale skirmish. The results aren't spectacular, but it's enough to prove the ability of the defector, not to boast.</p><p>Regardless of whether this person's future intelligence is reliable, if we really intend to attack Beihai, we need to prepare in advance, secretly mobilize the army, and gather forces in Beihai beforehand.</p><p>This involves a change in strategy, and as a general, Minshan cannot decide; he must seek approval from the clan leader and elders.</p><p>"You mean someone has defected and you've successfully attacked several times?" the mysterious person was quite surprised.</p><p>Minzhuo nodded, also finding it strange.</p><p>Learning that the enemy had a Nascent Soul stage expert backing them, he would have retreated if he could. If it weren't for the mysterious person's request to maintain the status quo to avoid alerting the enemy, he would have already ordered a full retreat.</p><p>Minzhuo was also worried about angering them, so he could only indirectly probe Minshan, hoping to stop him.  Unexpectedly, Minshan didn't understand his good intentions and even planned a major attack on Beihai, which he even succeeded in doing; the enemy's strong backer showed no reaction.</p><p>It makes one wonder if this so-called strong expert even exists.</p><p>The mysterious person pondered for a moment, then suddenly smiled, "After all, it's within the Mist Sea. It seems that person also has reservations. You mentioned earlier that Beihai is predominantly human?"</p><p>Minzhuo nodded, "That's right.  The sect of the Glass Fairy is located in Beihai."</p><p>"That's it! That person is of the demon race. Even if Beihai is destroyed, the demon race won't suffer much loss, but it would severely weaken the human race."</p><p>The mysterious person sneered, well aware of the capabilities of a Nascent Soul expert. Such a thing might happen once, but it would never happen again under the nose of a Nascent Soul cultivator, unless that person intentionally allows it.</p><p>"It seems that person also employs strategy.  Sticking to the rules is good! I hate unscrupulous people the most.  Let them eliminate their rivals; you can cooperate with them."</p><p>Minzhuo was slightly stunned, "Senior's meaning is...?"</p><p>"Remember what I said before? Consider that I and that person don't exist.  Do what you would have done in the past; now, do it the same way," the mysterious person calmly left this statement, their figure gradually fading.</p><p>The mist dissipated, turning back into a jade bead that fell into Minzhuo's hand.</p><p>Minzhuo was still pondering the mysterious person's words.</p><p>"Different races, different hearts," this is a universal truth.</p><p>The various tribes within the heterogenous race are numerous, and if not for the ancient pact and later requirement for all Saint Realm cultivators to enter the Holy Land, there would have been countless internal conflicts; their smaller tribes would have long since perished.</p><p>Those within the heterogenous race are certainly not perfectly united; they have only united to oppose the Changyou Tribe.  It seems that the demon race expert only intends to protect their own kind.</p><p>Since there's no direct confrontation with the strong expert, Minzhuo's worries lessened somewhat.</p><p>In fact, the Changyou Tribe has no choice. Until he breaks through to the second stage of the Void Realm, he can only follow orders.</p><p>Thinking about this, Minzhuo wrote a talisman and opened the door to his quiet chamber.</p><p>"Father," Minshu bowed.</p><p>Minzhuo gave him the talisman, "Tell the general to proceed as written, and I will explain to the elders."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Minshu dared not ask further and left.</p><p>...</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Gui Hou arrived silently from the west, appearing outside Qingyang Temple.  Seeing the large formation creating a dense fog that obscured the sky, he recalled he'd forgotten a token.</p><p>He thought for a moment, shot a beam of light into the formation, and waited. The fog rippled, revealing a small path.</p><p>"Daoist Gui," Li Yu'fu's voice came from within.</p><p>"How could I trouble Abbot Li to greet me in person!"</p><p>Gui Hou was flattered. This was a junior highly valued by the grand master, and now the abbot of Qingyang Temple; perhaps he'd inherit the grand master's mantle someday.</p><p>"Daoist Gui is too kind.  You and your comrades work tirelessly for the Grand Master, for Qingyang Temple, and for the people of the Storm World. I am eternally grateful,"</p><p>Li Yu'fu said solemnly.</p><p>Gui Hou and Luo Hou were nominally demon servants, but their cultivation was profound.  Except for Qin Sang, nobody dared treat them as mere servants.</p><p>Seeing Li Yu'fu's respect, Gui Hou was pleased and replied, "Abbot Li sits at the center, strategizing, guiding our actions. I am here to report to you."</p><p>"Please come in, Daoist."</p><p>Li Yu'fu invited Gui Hou to the main peak, and they sat down.</p><p>Gui Hou recounted the information he had gathered, "After the Jiao Dragon King's outburst at the tripartite meeting, he has become restless."</p><p>Though they tried to conceal it, their actions didn't escape my notice.  They've secretly dispatched some elite clan members in batches to the Demon Seaâ€¦</p><p>This move by the Demon Sea's demonic tribe seems to show they're determined toâ€¦ expand their territory.</p><p>Li Yu Fu appeared thoughtful.  "To be frank, I recently received news from the North Sea.  There have been several attacks there, and something feels amiss. I was worried about alerting them, so I haven't investigated thoroughly."</p><p>Gui Hou's expression shifted slightly. He exchanged a look with Li Yu Fu, both realizing a possible connection.</p><p>Each incident alone might seem insignificant, but together they're quite intriguing.</p><p>In fact, their every move has been extremely cautious.  Because this was their plan from the start, they've kept a close watch on the others. Only with Gui Hou's help, a top-tier expert, were these anomalies discovered; otherwise, they would have been overlooked.</p><p>"Master Li means the Jiao Long King might be diverting attention, using the North Sea to draw the Chang You tribe away, weakening their forces in the Demon Sea, so he can expand his territory?" Gui Hou mused.</p><p>"It could also be a multi-pronged strategy!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu said calmly.</p><p>They might have seen through the opponent's scheme, but they showed no urgency, as if watching a play unfold.</p><p>The more intricate the enemy's plans, the more disastrous their outcome!</p><p>A cold smile played on Gui Hou's lips. "Let's see how this Jiao Long King's strategy plays out!  Unfortunately, they'll likely wait until the Jiao Long King or the Dragon Saint King breaks through to the late Nascent Soul stage before making any major moves.  This could take several years, even decades."</p><p>Li Yu Fu nodded.  He didn't know how long it would take his master to complete the main altar. Let them revel in their success for now; we'll just watch and wait.</p><p>"I have another matter to request, Master Li," Gui Hou bowed slightly, explaining, "I hear that Xuan Tian Palace's Tong Palace Master and Si Sheng Palace's Bao Palace Master have been planning to build branch altars, and have already chosen locations. Only the Demon Sea remains unsettled, delaying the altar construction indefinitely.  I wish to ease the burden on our master and volunteer to infiltrate the Demon Sea, survey the terrain, and find a suitable location for the altarâ€¦"</p><p>After the Feng Bao Realm ascended, the landforms changed dramatically.  Later, the Chang You tribe occupied it, leaving it unrecognizable.</p><p>Gui Hou obtained some texts from the Demon Sea tribe and Si Sheng Palace, but they are insufficient for the current situation.  A personal survey is necessary.</p><p>"Chang You tribe experts are stationed there, and I fear I might be overwhelmed alone.  Could Daoist Luo accompany me to the Demon Sea?" Gui Hou asked.</p><p>The Demon Sea and Cang Lang Sea are vast.  The most important areas will certainly be guarded by Chang You tribe experts.  Thorough exploration will take time and inevitably lead to dangerous situations, requiring support.</p><p>He and Luo Hou are the most familiar with each other and trust each other implicitly.</p><p>"The Demon Sea is surrounded by hostile tribes, and Daoist Gui is willing to risk his life. I will certainly report your contributions to my master!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed deeply. "Daoist Luo is in seclusion.  I'll send someone to invite herâ€¦"</p><p>"No need. Luo Hou and I are old friends. If Master Li can spare someone, I'll go invite her myself," Gui Hou waved his hand.</p><p>"Everything is on track; we can still manage."</p><p>Li Yu Fu gestured for Gui Hou to proceed as he wished.</p><p>Gui Hou took his leave from Li Yu Fu and soon arrived at Luo Hou's cave.  Upon seeing Luo Hou, he sensed a change in her aura.  "Eh? You've broken through?"</p><p>"I benefited from the Wu tribe's incantations, and had signs of a breakthrough. Five years ago, it finally happened!"</p><p>Luo Hou felt.</p><p>Her cultivation journey was arduous.  Her physical body was once destroyed, leaving only her spirit.  After ascending to the Great Thousand World, it took a long time before she could regain a physical body, falling behind Gui Hou in cultivation.</p><p>Fortunately, following Qin Sang, she didn't lack cultivation resources, and later gained opportunities, finally breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, only a step away from the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Recalling the past, Gui Hou felt a pang in his heart. The changes of these centuries were unimaginable. Their mindsets had changed many times.</p><p>From the initial despair of being captured, to fearing Qin Sang and submitting to him, to being tempted by the *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, they now completely submit to Qin Sang.</p><p>At least, for now, the outcome is not bad. They followed a rather good master.</p><p>Because of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* Qin Sang gave them, they dare to dream of the Void Refinement stage, a bright future ahead.</p><p>"Congratulations on your advancement, Daoist Luo! With your help, my plans will be foolproof," Gui Hou said joyfully.</p><p>Learning of Gui Hou's intentions, Luo Hou readily agreed.</p><p>That night, the two Demon Marquesses left Qing Yang Temple. Gui Hou had already made arrangements, and they traversed the East Sea directly.</p><p>Passing by the Black Lion Saint King's training grounds, the two Demon Marquesses paid a visit to check on the Saint King's training progress.</p><p>Afterwards, they bid farewell to the Black Lion Saint King and headed east.</p>
