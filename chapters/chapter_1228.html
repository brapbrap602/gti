<h1>Chapter 1220: A Gathering of Heroes</h1><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang was in deep meditation at the Triple Pass when he received a message summoning him to Tianxing City for a council meeting. Neither Jing Lin nor the other person had been invited, so he set out alone, first heading to Hukou Pass to meet up with the Snake King.</p><p>They were once again received by Elder Ji. Following Elder Ji, Qin Sang and the Snake King arrived at an ice crystal palace surrounded by snow and wind. It was said that this was the place where the cultivators of the Tianxing Plateau had founded the Tianxing Alliance, making it a sacred site for the alliance.</p><p>"A few fellow Daoists have yet to arrive. I must go outside the city to welcome them. Please make yourselves at home," Elder Ji said, gesturing toward the ice crystal palace.</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Ji," Qin Sang and the Snake King clasped their hands in acknowledgment.</p><p>As they approached, the ice crystal palace opened automatically, and the voice of Daoist Zhenyi echoed from within.</p><p>"The Snake King and Daoist Mingyue have arrived. I apologize for not greeting you earlier. Please forgive my oversight."</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King exchanged a glance before stepping into the crystal palace. They immediately saw Daoist Zhenyi descending from the main seat. Inside the palace, several cultivators were already seated, all renowned experts from both regions.</p><p>Behind Daoist Zhenyi stood two armored generals, said to be twin brothers who shared a deep mental connection since birth. They cultivated a unique technique designed for twins, harnessing a pure Yang energy that was particularly effective against evil spirits. Together, their combined strength rivaled that of a peak mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>These two had been taken under Daoist Zhenyi's wing during their Qi Refining stage and had remained fiercely loyal to him. Their unwavering devotion was one of the reasons Daoist Zhenyi's position within the Tianxing Alliance was unshakable. In fact, the unity of the Tianxing Alliance could largely be attributed to Daoist Zhenyi alone, which was why no other elders from the alliance were present in the ice crystal palace.</p><p>In contrast, the factions of the Xiaohan Domain were far more fragmented and disorganized.</p><p>To the left of Daoist Zhenyi sat three individuals. The first was Qing Jun, disguised as Leng Yuntian. Qin Sang had recently learned that her identity was far more complex than just being the sect master of the Yuan Shen Sect. The city lord of Yinshan Pass, representing the loose cultivators, had even sought her out to establish friendly relations.</p><p>Qing Jun no longer made any effort to conceal her true identity, and many Nascent Soul cultivators were now aware that she was an imposter. However, even the Red-Haired Patriarch had been tight-lipped about the matter. These old schemers, who had little personal connection to Leng Yuntian and no enmity with Qing Jun, saw no reason to stir up trouble by exposing her.</p><p>The second was Daoist Chongyi, the master of Si Di. Although his cultivation was not as profound as Dongyang Bo's, his sect boasted three Nascent Soul cultivators, giving him significant influence. In the righteous path, he was a formidable rival to Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The third was none other than Xiang Qing, the current sect master of the Qingyang Demon Sect, whom Qin Sang had long wished to meet. Although a newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator, Xiang Qing's mastery of the Qingyang Demon Fire had reached unparalleled heights. His remarkable performance in numerous battles, including his ability to challenge cultivators of higher realms, had earned him the reputation of a late bloomer. He was now widely regarded as the second most powerful figure in the demonic path, second only to the Netherworld Demon Lord.</p><p>Xiang Qing appeared to be a young man in his early twenties, with sharp eyebrows and piercing eyes. He sat upright, exuding a cold and stern aura.</p><p>Once the Netherworld Demon Lord and Dongyang Bo arrived, the representatives of the major factions were all present, and the gathering of top-tier experts was complete. As Qin Sang and the Snake King entered, everyone rose to their feet.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang and the Snake King found their seats. Before sitting down, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to Xiang Qing, and he gave him a slight nod with a faint smile.</p><p>Xiang Qing was somewhat puzzled. This was his first interaction with the masked Moonlight Demon King, and he couldn't understand why the other party seemed to be deliberately extending goodwill toward him. However, he had heard numerous accounts of this demon's feats, including slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator and escaping after a fierce battle with the Old Demon Ye in the Abyssal Ruins. He knew that, like himself, this demon was a rising star among the demonic forces, capable of challenging those above his level. It wouldn't hurt to establish a friendly relationship, as they were bound to cross paths again in the future.</p><p>Xiang Qing forced a slight smile and nodded in return.</p><p>The others noticed the exchange, their eyes flickering between Qin Sang and Xiang Qing, but no one commented.</p><p>With not everyone present yet, the group engaged in casual discussions about their cultivation experiences. Such a gathering of top experts was rare, and as long as the topics didn't touch on core secrets, no one held back. Qin Sang and the Snake King shared some insights into demonic cultivation, and the others listened attentively.</p><p>After about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the Netherworld Demon Lord and Dongyang Bo arrived together.</p><p>"Apologies for keeping everyone waiting," Dongyang Bo said with a charming smile, first offering his apologies and then greeting each person in turn. When he reached Qin Sang, he said, "So this is Daoist Mingyue? I've long admired your reputation, but we've never had the chance to meet until now. It's an honor to finally see you in person!"</p><p>"You flatter me. It is I who have long admired you," Qin Sang replied with a light chuckle, standing up to return the greeting, his tone calm and measured.</p><p>Dongyang Bo could never have imagined that the demon king before him was once a disciple he had schemed against.</p><p>Qing Jun, watching the two exchange pleasantries with feigned politeness, couldn't help but smirk inwardly.</p><p>After the pleasantries, Daoist Zhenyi wasted no time and got straight to the point, asking the Snake King and Qin Sang to recount their experiences in the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King had already prepared their story, and the Snake King took the lead in narrating it.</p><p>Once they finished, Xiang Qing spoke up. "After receiving the news from the two demon kings, I personally ventured deep into the inner valley of the Boundless Valley and indeed discovered something unusual. Recently, there have been several storms in the Boundless Valley. While storms have occurred in the past due to fluctuations in the ancient restrictions, they have never been this frequent. I found the Blood Lake, and the ancient restrictions around it were constantly shaking, as if someone was trying to forcibly break through them. If the two Blood Lakes are connected, it's likely that Old Demon Ye's actions are affecting this area..."</p><p>In just a few sentences, Xiang Qing shared his findings and speculations.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi suddenly chuckled. "Could it be that Old Demon Ye has been plotting all this time for the sake of the Blood Lake? By rallying the Sin Abyss and launching a fierce attack on the Tianxing Plateau, he's trying to divert our attention here, preventing us from noticing the anomalies in the Boundless Valley and disrupting their plans at the Blood Lake?"</p><p>The others exchanged glances.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi's speculation seemed far-fetched, but it wasn't entirely implausible. It was almost too unbelievable—how could the Blood Lake hold such immense benefits that the Sin Abyss would go to such lengths to assist Old Demon Ye in his schemes?</p><p>Seeing the doubtful expressions on everyone's faces, Daoist Chongyi chuckled. "I'm just speculating. However, Old Demon Ye has even neglected the battlefield, which shows that the Blood Lake must be of utmost importance to them. We cannot allow them to succeed so easily."</p><p>"The Boundless Valley lies within the Xiaohan Domain. What do the two of you think?" Daoist Zhenyi interjected, not offering his own opinion but instead looking toward Dongyang Bo and the Netherworld Demon Lord.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord spoke in a deep voice. "Daoist Xiang has thoroughly inspected the area, and the restrictions around the Blood Lake are still quite stable. It won't be easy for Old Demon Ye to break through them. In the meantime, we should station people at the Boundless Valley to keep us informed of any developments. Daoist Chongyi is right—this matter is too important to let Old Demon Ye act unchecked. We need to send someone in to disrupt their plans. However, we must also be wary of the Sin Abyss using this as an opportunity to lure us away from our defenses."</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi remained expressionless, glancing at the other Nascent Soul cultivators from the Xiaohan Domain. These individuals represented various interests and were often at odds with one another, but they seemed to have reached a tacit understanding. After the Netherworld Demon Lord finished speaking, they all nodded in agreement, and no one raised any objections.</p>
