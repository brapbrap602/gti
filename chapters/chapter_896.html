<h1>Chapter 888: Forbidden Zone</h1><p>The Demonic Core, birthed from the Sword Soul, flickered with a faint yellow light, a residual power of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The Yin and Yang energies entered the Purple Mansion, paused briefly, then flew to the Demonic Core, revolving around it slowly and visibly.</p><p>“It works!”</p><p>The Avatar opened his eyes, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>After reviewing the incantation, he sensed the Yin Yang Armor was extraordinary.  Later, listening to the Dao Child’s teachings, he gained further understanding. With his experience, it wasn’t difficult to apply the principles of this basic incantation in new ways.</p><p>Now, with a little experimentation, he had successfully stored the Yin Yang Armor within his Purple Mansion without it dissipating.</p><p>This meant the Yin Yang Armor could protect not just the physical body, but also the Demonic Core.</p><p>The main body, protected by the Jade Buddha, didn't urgently need an incantation to protect the Demonic Core from attacks. No armor could compare to the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Moreover, he suspected the Yin Yang Heaven Fighting Secret Art was incomplete. The restored version likely couldn't replicate the Yin Yang Armor's subsequent transformations and therefore couldn't unleash its true power.</p><p>However, wearing the armor could conceal the Jade Buddha's golden light, providing a layer of cover.</p><p>Although even Nascent Soul ancestors rarely projected their Nascent Souls outside their bodies, minimizing the risk of exposing the Jade Buddha, nothing was absolute in the cultivation world. As his cultivation increased, his opponents' methods became more powerful and bizarre, and his own knowledge broadened. Concealing the Jade Buddha's existence was always beneficial.</p><p>This treasure was his greatest secret.</p><p>If discovered, it could lead to trouble.</p><p>Once his main body cultivated a Yin Yang Armor to cover its Demonic Core, the golden light would be hidden.</p><p>The Jade Buddha's golden light was too unique to be concealed by ordinary methods; only this special armor formed from Yin and Yang energies could perfectly mask it.</p><p>Compared to the Yin Yang Heaven Fighting Secret Art, this basic incantation delighted him more.</p><p>The Avatar suppressed his joy and left the stone chamber.</p><p>Gao Yi, standing outside, glanced inside and asked, perplexed, "Junior Brother Zhang, you refined the circular pendant long ago. Why didn't you call me?"</p><p>"I didn't want to interrupt Senior Brother's important matters.  Since I could cultivate here anyway, I didn't disturb you."</p><p>The Avatar replied calmly.</p><p>"I have no important matters. I'll take you to your cave now."</p><p>Gao Yi chuckled, his impression of the Avatar improving.</p><p>They left the stone hall together, flying towards the mountain where the caves were located.  Along the way, Gao Yi introduced him to fellow disciples.</p><p>Barely thirty, Gao Yi, having dedicated his time to refining tools with Jin Yan, possessed a straightforward nature.  Subtly flattered by the Avatar, he treated him as a confidant, diligently arranging his cave dwelling.</p><p>By the time everything was settled, night had fallen.</p><p>The Avatar's cave, located at the mountain peak, offered an excellent view. He looked up at the bright moon and stars, then swept his gaze across the Lándòu Sect, a smile gracing his face before he turned and closed the door.</p><p>Over the next few days, the Avatar remained at the Lándòu Sect, refining the Yin Yang Armor and making acquaintances.</p><p>He found an opportunity to leave the sect and meet his main body, sharing information and the Yin Yang Armor incantation.</p><p>Outside the Lándòu Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang found a desolate mountain, created a cave, and sat inside, making hand seals.</p><p>With his cultivation, mastering this incantation was effortless. Within an hour, two masses of energy, one black and one white, formed around him.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, glanced around, and shouted, "Condense!"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Yin and Yang energies collided, the resulting fluctuations perfectly suppressed by Qin Sang.</p><p>The two masses merged, seemingly devouring each other.</p><p>Soon, a gray armor appeared on Qin Sang.  It looked ordinary, except for a Yin Yang Tai Chi symbol on the chest, resembling Hua Yang's Yin Yang disc, slowly rotating.</p><p>"Withdraw!"</p><p>Qin Sang commanded, and the Yin Yang Armor vanished into his body.</p><p>Simultaneously, a Yin Yang Armor appeared around his Demonic Core within his Purple Mansion, concealing the faint yellow light emitted by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>"This armor isn't powerful, its use limited in high-level battles, but it's sufficient for hiding the Jade Buddha. It's a small gain."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, refining it further before shifting his focus.</p><p>“The direct disciples of the Yin Yang lineage are unaware of Fighting Ox Peak's existence. It seems many secrets are hidden there. I'll let my Avatar continue investigating while I proceed with my plan to connect with Core Formation cultivators.”</p><p>Qin Sang decided, his figure vanishing as he headed towards the Lándòu Sect market.</p><p>…</p><p>Lándòu Sect.</p><p>All the disciples gathered in the largest chamber of the stone hall.  Jin Yan sat on a platform, speaking slowly.</p><p>It was the thrice-monthly lecture day, with disciples consulting Jin Yan on cultivation and refining, a reward for their hard work.</p><p>The Avatar was among them.</p><p>Despite his rough appearance, Jin Yan was good-natured, patiently answering the disciples’ questions.</p><p>After the formal lecture, the atmosphere relaxed.</p><p>The Avatar was lost in thought when he sensed something, turning to see a stocky youth glare at him and raise his hand.</p><p>The Avatar's expression shifted, and he chuckled inwardly.</p><p>"Xióng Biāo, what questions do you have?"</p><p>Jin Yan called on him.</p><p>Xióng Biāo stood and said, "Uncle Jin, besides our Five Elements and Yin Yang lineages, are there other direct lineages in our sect?"</p><p>Jin Yan frowned, reprimanding, "What kind of question is that! How does it benefit your cultivation?"</p><p>"I made a bet with Junior Brother Zhang. He insists there's another direct lineage called Fighting Ox Peak. We've never heard of it. He must be tricking me," Xióng Biāo said, feigning grievance.</p><p>"Fighting Ox Peak!"</p><p>Jin Yan's expression changed, his gaze sharpening as he fixed it on the Avatar. "Who told you about Fighting Ox Peak?"</p><p>Seeing this, the Avatar realized Jin Yan knew something.</p><p>Having reached late-stage Foundation Establishment and skilled in refining, Jin Yan held a prominent position in the Lándòu Sect, occupying the stone hall alone. He surely knew more secrets than the Dao Child.</p><p>Hoping to glean information from Jin Yan, the Avatar had chosen a naive youth to provoke him, and the bait was taken.</p><p>His thoughts racing, the Avatar stood up, feigning fear and respect. “Disciple heard Grandmaster Hua Yang mention Fighting Ox Peak as a direct lineage at the Smoke and Water Pavilion. After joining the sect, I couldn’t find it, so I asked Senior Brother Xióng…”</p><p>His abduction from the Smoke and Water Pavilion by Hua Yang was known throughout the Lándòu Sect, including by Jin Yan.</p><p>"Grandmaster Hua Yang…"</p><p>Jin Yan's expression softened slightly. After a moment of silence, he said, "Whether it's a direct lineage, I'm not sure. However, that place is now a forbidden zone. Of course, you haven't heard of it… From now on, no one is to mention Fighting Ox Peak. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</p><p>Jin Yan snorted, flicking his sleeves as he left.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>May everyone prosper! Prosper! Prosper!</p>
