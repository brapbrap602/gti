<h1>Chapter 1578: The Suspicious Tomb by the Water</h1><p>Chapter 1578: The Suspicious Tomb by the Water</p><p>Su Zinan smiled, sharing the good news with Old Wu.  But his actions were those of a treacherous villain, harming the loyal.</p><p>The net was made from the sinews of a spirit python raised in a snake pit—a creature called a "bound earth dragon."  It's not a stretch to call it "dragon sinew."  The sinew was soaked in potent herbs for a hundred years, then refined through ninety-nine processes, finally forged into a net—invisible, nearly indestructible, and incredibly strong.</p><p>Old Wu fell into the trap, ensnared.</p><p>"Monster!"</p><p>Old Wu never imagined that the man he raised would bring about his ruin.</p><p>Su Zinan remained unmoved, showing no shame, his eyes filled with intense anticipation.</p><p>The dragon sinew net tightened, revealing patterns resembling pythons.  The sinews seemed to transform back into bound earth dragons, their bodies intertwined, writhing ceaselessly.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The center of the dragon sinew net bulged, emitting a muffled sound.  The Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd attacked wildly from within.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted, calmly flicking his fingers.  Brilliant light filled the air, a magical array appearing, its energy surging, symbols flowing, converging within the net, targeting the Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd.</p><p>Each symbol that struck the halberd dimmed its light; Old Wu felt the weapon becoming heavier, a barrier growing between him and his life-bound treasure.</p><p>Su Zinan knew Old Wu well.  The trap wasn't just the dragon sinew net; it also included a magical array targeting the halberd!</p><p>Old Wu emitted a guttural sound, his blood shadow reappearing, much fainter than when he fought Qin Sang.  His contorted face showed immense strain.  The explosion of the Sun God Tree had severely weakened him.</p><p>Forcing his blood shadow to aid in wielding the halberd, Old Wu was attacked by three faceless heads.  Their mouths split wide, devouring most of the blood shadow in an instant.</p><p>The Blood-Drinking Demon Halberd's power waned, its attack nearly broken.</p><p>Old Wu roared, burning his life essence to forcefully complete the halberd's technique.</p><p>The dragon sinew net strained, two intersecting bloodstains appearing.  With a ripping sound, the sinews snapped, the bound earth dragons letting out silent wails as the net tore.</p><p>At that moment, the magical array's power solidified on the halberd's surface, like frost, dulling its light, hindering its use.</p><p>Old Wu, unable to retrieve his life-bound treasure, produced a talisman disc.  Its runes were simple, only three in number.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The disc shattered, releasing the talismans.  The three merged, their power solidifying into a pair of crimson, blood-red wings, exuding an aura of deadly ferocity.</p><p>The wings appeared at Old Wu's side and flapped.</p><p>Old Wu transformed into a blood-red light, escaping into the air.</p><p>But the wings only flapped once before a faint, unremarkable black light shot from the spirit array in the medicinal pool, striking Old Wu mid-air.  With a loud *pop*, his body exploded into a mist of blood, leaving no remains.</p><p>"You forgot, didn't you? I learned all this from you..."</p><p>Su Zinan smirked, his gaze shifting toward the bamboo forest.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The earth exploded.  A blood shadow shot skyward—Old Wu's nascent soul, abandoning his body in an attempt to escape.  His eyes were closed, trembling, devoid of consciousness.</p><p>Three faceless heads circled his nascent soul, spewing chilling ghostly energy.</p><p>One, unable to contain itself, pushed the others aside, its mouth wide open, swallowing Old Wu's nascent soul before returning to its master.</p><p>The other two shrieked in frustration, powerless.</p><p>Su Zinan sat cross-legged, his fingers weaving intricate hand seals, sending them into the head that had consumed Old Wu's nascent soul.</p><p>The head rolled, emitting shrill cries.  Soon, it stilled. Its surface swelled and receded, features forming—a face identical to Old Wu's.</p><p>A hazy, dark mist swirled beneath the head; Old Wu's soul was trapped there.</p><p>The head's eyes snapped open.  Seeing Su Zinan, it radiated hatred, its expression struggling violently, then weakening, until it became completely numb.</p><p>"Two more to go..."</p><p>Su Zinan murmured, looking at the newly formed head.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Three faceless heads, led by Wu Laogui, flew before Su Zinan.  Su Zinan produced a triangular black banner, and retracted it.</p><p>Standing up, Su Zinan stretched, glanced at the battlefield, a wicked smile playing on his lips. He turned and left the purple bamboo forest.</p><p>Years separated from their lover, the women’s longing was overwhelming. Seeing Su Zinan, they were overjoyed, yet tinged with resentment.</p><p>Surrounded by beauties, he was enjoying himself.  Their voices were like the songs of birds, their fragrance like orchids and cinnamon.</p><p>Su Zinan embraced them, his eyes half-closed, savoring their beauty. Suddenly, he asked, "Did you hear a sound just now?"</p><p>The women froze, hastily shaking their heads.</p><p>Su Zinan looked around, sighing, "Alas, time is merciless, youth fleeting, beauty fades in the blink of an eye."</p><p>Before his words faded, dragon tendons shot from his fingertips, wrapping tightly around the women's necks with a ‘whoosh’ sound, lifting them into the air.</p><p>Crack… crack…</p><p>Their neck bones were nearly snapped.</p><p>The women were filled with pain, struggling desperately, utterly incredulous.  Their lover had turned cruel in an instant.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, Su Zinan's disgust deepened.  Like discarding trash, he threw them into a snake pit in the bamboo forest to be devoured by the earth-bound dragons.</p><p>Only one female cultivator, a Golden Core stage cultivator, remained, her face etched with terror.</p><p>Su Zinan approached, pinching her chin, lifting her face slightly. He touched her forehead, saying, "Forget."</p><p>The cultivator closed her eyes, then slowly opened them again. Looking at her lover so close, her cheeks flushed slightly, her eyes watery, filled with affection.</p><p>"When you reach the Nascent Soul stage, you will be the Moon Princess."</p><p>Su Zinan kissed the cultivator lightly, then turned and left Luye.</p><p>…</p><p>In the ice cave.</p><p>Qin Sang and his manifestation entered the fissure.</p><p>As they descended, Qin Sang silently calculated the time.</p><p>All signs pointed to the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators from Central Plains, a fact confirmed by the Moon Princess.</p><p>That old man would return for reinforcements, at most summoning Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>However, this only emboldened Qin Sang's decision-making.  Against such a powerful enemy, capable of causing his utter ruin, no one dared to be certain unless they had a 100% chance of success.</p><p>The main body would go down to check the situation.</p><p>If it led directly to the tomb of the Water Phase Lord, the main body and the manifestation working together could easily suppress Yan Shan Lao Ren, retrieve the artifact, and leave.</p><p>But if the situation below was too complex, and the problem couldn't be solved immediately, taking too long, he would send either the main body or the manifestation away, leaving himself a way out.</p><p>The fissure led to an unknown place.</p><p>The deeper they went, the colder it became, the denser the chilling煞 energy.</p><p>These signs indicated that the source of the chilling煞 energy lay below, likely originating from the tomb of the Water Phase Lord.</p><p>The place was filled with restrictions.</p><p>As Qin Sang advanced, he discovered that some restrictions had already been broken, undoubtedly by Yan Shan Lao Ren. Many restrictions remained intact, yet Qin Sang couldn't figure out how he had passed.</p><p>Although there were traces of forceful breaking, the techniques were very skillful, suggesting he was familiar with the place.</p><p>Qin Sang could only resort to brute force.</p><p>Guided by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, the demonic fire and the four-winged snake seal took turns smashing a path forward.</p><p>Deep within the fissure.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren stood before a white ice wall, his hands pressed against it. Circles of blue water flowed from his palms, spreading across the entire wall.</p><p>The ice wall was embedded in the stone wall, not ordinary glacial ice, but infused with powerful restrictions, blocking spiritual sense and vision, obscuring the inside.</p><p>Under the impact of the water, the ice wall gradually changed from white to transparent. Once the white disappeared, signifying the depletion of the ice wall's power, Yan Shan Lao Ren could enter the tomb.</p><p>Just as he was concentrating on breaking the restriction, the ground shook violently.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren's expression changed drastically. Looking up, he could only see countless restrictions. His eyes flickered, he concentrated his true essence, forming a line of sound that pierced through the restrictions, "I didn't expect Daoist Brother to win so quickly. No wonder Sect Master Situ praised you so highly in his letter."</p><p>Qin Sang, rapidly breaking through the restrictions, faintly heard Yan Shan Lao Ren's voice. He paused slightly, glanced around, and had his manifestation respond, "I also didn't expect Daoist Brother to be the Water Phase successor of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect!"</p><p>"Not so."</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren denied, "I am not a successor. The Water Phase of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is divided into Water and Ice branches. I merely obtained some of the Water branch's cultivation techniques and secret arts, and vaguely know a little about its secrets – nothing significant. Otherwise, I would not have stayed in the Northern Wilderness for so many years, waiting until today."</p><p>"Is this really the tomb of the Water Phase Lord? And what about the Snow Fox?"</p><p>Qin Sang continued his efforts, asking back in a low voice.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan agreed to answer his questions.  "Correct, the outer structure is a decoy tomb, the inner one the real tomb! The snow fox is a key, preventing the treasures from being lost to time. If a true successor of the Water Phase lineage passes through the snowfields, discovers the snow fox, they will know this is the master's tomb.  Gaining the snow fox's acceptance allows them to take the Water Phase Master's legacy. I suspect, fearing someone with your keen spiritual perception might get there first, the Water Phase Master created a decoy tomb. Those unaware would believe it is for refining ice crystals, steal them, and overlook the true treasure…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Water Phase Master’s arrangement was ingenious; to appear authentic, he even set up a killing formation within the formation, seemingly protecting the ice crystals from theft.</p><p>Before Yanshan's disappearance, he hadn't considered this possibility.</p><p>If Yanshan hadn't secretly interfered, disrupting the seamless layout, even with Qin Sang and the Sky Eye Butterfly searching, they wouldn't have discovered it so easily.</p><p>Qin Sang's ignorance didn't mean Lu Ye was unaware.</p><p>If Lu Ye hadn't interfered, Yanshan could have followed Qin Sang, then secretly returned for the treasure. Qin Sang wouldn't even know he’d been used.</p><p>"So, you used me to find the tomb?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Yanshan didn't answer directly. "I had no intention of harming you. You sought ice crystals, I, the Water Phase Master's legacy; there was no conflict.  I had no intention of keeping the ice crystals, fulfilling your desires entirely—is that deception?  We each took what we wanted.”</p><p>"How do you explain Lu Ye’s actions?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing.</p><p>Yanshan's desire for the Water Phase Master's legacy was understandable, Qin Sang could accept that.  But he wouldn't tolerate being manipulated and making an enemy of Lu Ye.</p><p>Yanshan sighed, "If I said I didn't know Lu Ye, had never seen him here before, you wouldn't believe me, would you?  Knowing this, I wouldn't have been so careless chasing the snow fox. Besides…didn’t you also have a hidden helper, for half a year?  Quite patient, both of you!"</p><p>Situ Yu hadn’t mentioned Qin Sang’s ability to create an avatar in his letter; Yanshan was unaware.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He wasn't a good person; he'd taken what he wanted under the guise of seeking the Dao,  pretending to steal treasures.</p><p>However, given the chance to cooperate, he preferred it. His main body followed only as a precaution.</p><p>Yanshan wouldn't believe that, if he said so.</p><p>If he were in Yanshan's shoes, he’d also be suspicious and cautious.</p><p>After a short silence, Yanshan sighed, "Luckily you were there as a hidden asset; otherwise, we'd both be in grave danger. Whether you believe me or not, I had no intention of harming you. I admired your abilities, hoping we could be friends; fate had other plans. Since you've seen through me, I have nothing to say.  The Water Phase Master's legacy belongs to the strongest! From now on, we go our separate ways!"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang rapidly approached, the fissure vibrating violently.</p><p>Yanshan looked down at his hands.</p><p>His fingers trembled, dense ripples appeared, not only moving along the ice wall's surface, but visibly penetrating it. The white ice inside grew thinner under their impact.</p><p>His inheritance was incomplete;  achieving this after years of effort was remarkable.</p><p>Whether influenced by the external vibrations or a tremor in the ice wall itself, the recoil jolted Yanshan, making his breathing heavy.</p><p>In a flash, the white ice thinned another layer, becoming more transparent.</p><p>Yanshan rejoiced, exerting all his energy. Primal Water surged from his palm into the ice wall, like a giant hammer.  A crack appeared in the center of the ice wall with a sharp 'crack'.</p><p>Once breached, the ice wall could no longer hold.</p><p>The crack spread rapidly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ice wall shattered, ice shards flying everywhere.</p><p>Yanshan couldn't hide his joy, pushing through the broken ice into the tomb.</p><p>The tomb was small, square; several lines of writing were carved on the wall opposite the entrance, likely the Water Phase Master's last words.</p><p>The interior was clearly visible.</p><p>A long, rectangular block of ice lay in the center.  Yanshan thought it was the master's coffin, but there were no remains, just a solid ice bed.</p><p>The Water Phase Master may have already passed away.</p><p>Three jade boxes rested neatly on the ice bed.</p><p>Before the ice bed, a spirit array was still active.  A beautifully crafted ice disc, suspended in mid-air, was at its heart; crystal clear, it looked extraordinary.</p><p>The array released a wisp of icy Qi from the disc at intervals, secretly flowing to the outer decoy tomb, condensing into ice crystals to deceive intruders.</p><p>Yanshan's eyes were fixed on the ice disc in the array, unable to look away.</p>
