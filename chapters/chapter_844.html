<h1>Chapter 836: The Leopard Demon</h1><p>Chapter 836: The Leopard Demon</p><p>Demon beasts besiege the island.</p><p>Yu Heng Island has become a demon beast paradise.</p><p>Strangely, this situation has lasted for over three months, with the beasts surrounding the island but neither attacking nor retreating.</p><p>Yet, the cultivators on the island feel no relief.</p><p>As time passes, more and more demon beasts continuously gather here, now reaching an astonishing number, occupying a large area of the sea around Yu Heng Island.</p><p>Initially, the island's cultivators, out of caution, did not take the initiative to attack, adopting a defensive strategy.  Traditionally, demon beasts would leave after failing to break through the island's protective formation within a few days.</p><p>They realized their mistake too late; trapped by so many beasts, no one could feel at ease.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the edge of the beast horde…</p><p>A group of demon beasts formed a circle, with several unusually large demons within.</p><p>There was a four-limbed fish demon, its limbs as white and tender as a baby's.</p><p>There was a crane of extraordinary bearing, its feathers like snow, its eyes arrogant and domineering.</p><p>…</p><p>Among them, a leopard demon was the most striking.  This demon had a peculiar appearance; it lacked fur, instead possessing fine scales, and sharp horns on its forehead, appearing incredibly majestic.</p><p>Their eyes were bright and agile, their intelligence far exceeding that of the surrounding beasts.</p><p>Astonishingly, these few demon beasts could speak and communicate fluently, yet they were clearly not transformed demons.</p><p>There's only one explanation: these beasts have consumed precious Emperor's Flowing Liquid, prematurely awakening their intelligence.</p><p>Demon beasts only develop the ability to transform after the Emperor's Flowing Liquid appears; could there be transformed demons behind these beasts?</p><p>Some were on the water's surface, some floated in the air.  The other beasts were extremely afraid of them; the area was deathly silent.</p><p>Arguments could be heard from within, seemingly the leopard demon facing the other large demons alone.</p><p>"You have two months to gather all your subordinates to attack this island.  Disobey, and you will die!"</p><p>The leopard demon roared, issuing the order, its gaze cold and piercing.</p><p>The other demons exchanged glances, some showing discontent.</p><p>Their cultivations were not inferior to the leopard demon's, but they feared its status, not necessarily the demon itself.</p><p>The crane demon snorted coldly, its voice sharp, "The Great King ordered me to lead my subordinates to harass the humans, to keep them busy and distract them.  He didn't say we should directly attack a human stronghold, especially a large island guarded by a human Yuan Ying cultivator!  The Great King isn't even here.  We don't know how much blood we'll have to spill to even break the island's protective formation, and even if we do, what then?  If a human Yuan Ying cultivator wants to escape, there's no way to stop him.  If he gets the chance, killing one or two of us won't be difficult!"</p><p>The other demons echoed this sentiment, claiming their own Great King gave similar orders and were unwilling to risk an attack with the leopard demon.</p><p>They used the orders of their transformed demon overlords to pressure the leopard demon, but it scoffed, coldly saying, "I came here with the orders of the Jiao King. Even your Great King must obey our Jiao clan's commands! Whoever defies my order is defying the Jiao clan! Let's see how many heads you have!"</p><p>The leopard demon, despite its appearance, constantly referred to itself as part of the Jiao clan, a seemingly absurd claim, but no demon dared to laugh.</p><p>Looking at its scales and horns, so different from other leopard demons, perhaps it truly possessed Jiao dragon blood.</p><p>Hearing this, the other large demons held their breaths, exchanging glances, their momentum noticeably weakening.</p><p>Although they suspected the leopard demon was bluffing, the pressure from the Jiao clan was too strong.</p><p>Moreover, part of the leopard demon's statement was true; their own Great King wouldn't dare to oppose the Jiao clan.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The fish demon weakly said, "The Great King said this matter is of great importance, a collaboration between the Jiao King and the various clans, using almost half the power of the Demon Sea.  If we act rashly and the cultivators discover the Great King is absent, it could affect the Jiao King's plan…"</p><p>Seeing the other demons weaken, the leopard demon smirked, softening its tone slightly.  "Only our actions here can affect the grand plan?  And aren't we already distracting and confusing the cultivators? My goal isn't extermination, but to find someone.  This person is very important to our Jiao clan; he committed a grave crime, angering the Jiao King, a person the Jiao King specifically ordered to be killed. Remember his aura; once you sense it, kill him at all costs! Eliminating him will be a great achievement!"</p><p>The person the leopard demon spoke of was Qin Sang.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang acted quickly, decisively fleeing, the Jiao King pursuing him without success, but remembering Qin Sang's aura.</p><p>Furthermore, if you see someone using a treasure of this shape, it must be this person…"</p><p>The leopard demon dipped a forepaw into the water, and a curtain of water rose, transforming into a spiral image dotted with stars.</p><p>The spiral image was strikingly similar to Qin Sang's Star Conch, about seven or eight points alike.</p><p>The demons silently memorized the shape of the spiral image, seemingly unaware of the Star Conch's unique properties.</p><p>Then, the demons dispersed, disappearing into the depths of the demon sea to gather their forces.</p><p>The leopard demon, having achieved its goal, watched the other beasts' backs, a cunning glint in its eyes.  When it turned towards Yu Heng Island, its gaze turned greedy.</p><p>…</p><p>The atmosphere on Yu Heng Island was heavy.</p><p>The cultivators on the island were deeply worried every time they saw the overwhelming demonic energy and dark clouds, fear evident in their eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang led a team of Foundation Establishment cultivators on patrol and guard duty.</p><p>As night fell, their patrol finally ended, allowing them some rest.</p><p>Returning to her temporary cave dwelling, Qin Sang unexpectedly found Lady Liu and Jin Ying waiting.</p><p>Since eliminating Xiang Yi, Jin Ying had become more respectful towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Though Lady Liu had sworn to keep the details of the battle secret, Jin Ying's intelligence allowed her to guess at the truth.</p><p>"When did you two arrive? Has something happened?"</p><p>Qin Sang invited them to sit.</p><p>They too were busy with their own tasks, their time for cultivation severely limited, and they rarely saw each other.</p><p>"Can't we visit a fellow cultivator without an emergency?"</p><p>With her enemy defeated, Lady Liu finally emerged from her shadow.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Lady Liu's smile faded, and she revealed startling news, "The island master is considering abandoning the island and breaking out!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and looked to Jin Ying.</p><p>Jin Ying's expression was equally grave, nodding heavily. She had learned this information through the Nine Stars Society from the Merchant Guild.</p><p>"Has the situation become this serious?"</p><p>Qin Sang found it hard to believe. Abandoning the island meant not only giving up centuries of development but also sacrificing the lives of most of the cultivators on the island!</p><p>Without the protective island formation, how many would survive?</p><p>Jin Ying said gravely, "The Merchant Guild only learned this today. The island master's contact with the outside world has been severed. No news can get in or out; it's become an isolated island.  Two days ago, a large number of demons gathered, a terrifying amount, and they're clearly preparing for something; it doesn't seem like a bluff. They might be about to attack."</p><p>—</p><p>Typing this on my phone on the train.  Chapter two will be posted after it’s finished; if not tonight, tomorrow.</p>
