<h1>Chapter 1129: Smooth Sailing</h1><p>"I recall that this young friend Qin Sang was only at the False Core Realm back then. He was brought into the Purple Micro Palace by Daoist Dongyang and Lady Chenyan. Originally a disciple of Mount Shaohua, when did he change his allegiance?" Daoist Chongyi narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Qin Sang from head to toe before glancing at Dongyang Bo, suddenly posing the question.</p><p>Many of the Nascent Soul Ancestors present in the grand hall had been there that year. They recalled the entanglements between the two parties and, seeing Qin Sang calmly walk behind Qing Jun, showing great indifference to his former master Dongyang Bo, they all turned their playful gazes toward Dongyang Bo. At this moment, few truly cared about Qin Sang.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi clicked his tongue, "Back when he entered the Purple Micro Palace, this lad was only at the False Core Realm. Now, his cultivation has reached a level that places him among the top of the younger generation in both regions. Such a talented disciple, and Daoist Dongyang was willing to let him go?"</p><p>"Could he be a traitor who betrayed his sect and dishonored his ancestors? Otherwise, Fellow Daoist Leng wouldn't have taken him into the Yuan Shen Sect and even made him an elder," a cultivator from the Tianxing Alliance chimed in, purely out of curiosity, his gaze shifting between Dongyang Bo and Qing Jun.</p><p>The mountain gates of Mount Shaohua and the Yuan Shen Sect were both located on the northern shore of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, one to the east and the other to the west. Could it be that not only were they close in proximity, but their disciples could also be exchanged freely?</p><p>Qing Jun, wearing a mask and attending the alliance meeting, was still disguised as Leng Yuntian. Although the Nascent Soul cultivators present vaguely knew the truth, they all tacitly accepted it, and no one exposed her.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's smile remained unchanged as he spoke in a tone tinged with lament, "People strive for higher grounds, just as water flows to lower places. What's wrong with that? No wonder Lady Chenyan searched for Qin Sang for so many years without success. It turns out he was hidden away by Sect Master Leng."</p><p>"Lady Chenyan was looking for him?"</p><p>"Wasn't this kid only at the False Core Realm back then? Lady Chenyan, a dignified Nascent Soul Ancestor, what could she possibly have to do with him?"</p><p>...</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were clearly very familiar with Chenyan, having personally witnessed her peerless beauty, and most of them also knew of her origins. Hearing this, they were all greatly surprised. They were very curious—had Qin Sang done something to anger Chenyan, or was there another reason? Yet, Dongyang Bo suddenly fell silent, leaving them hanging.</p><p>"This kid has quite the luck with women..." someone thought to themselves, but in front of Qing Jun, they dared not voice it out loud.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly stared at Dongyang Bo. Truly a cunning and shameless old fox. Without mentioning the origin of their grievances, he had skillfully shifted everyone's attention with a few ambiguous words. Qin Sang didn't know how much of Dongyang Bo's words were true and how much were false. Had Chenyan really been looking for him? And for what reason? Could it be that Chenyan was truly trapped by the backlash of the "Mysterious Jade Cauldron True Scripture," and had to cultivate that damned Stone Bridge Zen to resolve the hidden danger, thus continuing to cooperate with Dongyang Bo to find him? In the Purple Micro Palace, Chenyan had helped him escape only because she was forced by Dongyang Bo—a mere expedient measure. If that were truly the case, he had unwittingly gained another formidable enemy, one with an immense background.</p><p>Qin Sang silently seethed with hatred. Dongyang Bo's deliberate ambiguity made it clear that he would not reveal the truth. If it were someone else, whether driven by unwarranted ambitions or overwhelmed by the pressure of facing two Nascent Soul enemies, they might have been thrown into a state of uncertainty upon hearing such words. With even the slightest crack in their Dao heart, Dongyang Bo would have succeeded.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, refraining from arguing. Right now, the most important thing was to enter the Heaven-Pointing Peak. He didn't want any complications. To seek justice, he would at least need sufficient strength.</p><p>Seeing that both Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, the parties involved, were being evasive, the others turned their gazes to Qing Jun. Could there be some enmity between her and Chenyan?</p><p>Qing Jun cut straight to the point, "Regardless of which sect Qin Sang belongs to, his contributions are undeniable. When this matter was initially discussed, most of you were present. Surely you haven't forgotten?"</p><p>Before her words had fully settled, a rather young cultivator from the Tianxing Alliance chimed in, "Indeed, thanks to these two juniors, I only lost my physical body, but my Nascent Soul managed to escape in time." As he spoke, he nodded amiably toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leapt with joy, and he quickly bowed in gratitude.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi nodded lightly, "The other junior has already been rewarded. It wouldn't be fair to show favoritism now. I understand Fellow Daoist Leng's intentions. Young friend Qin wishes to enter the Heaven-Pointing Peak to cultivate a secret technique using the abundant astral energy there? Such techniques are exceedingly rare in this era. May I ask what technique it is, and whether its cultivation process might affect the fragile space of the Heaven-Pointing Peak?"</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord also spoke, "The power of the Purple Micro Palace's immortal formation may continue to weaken—that remains uncertain. Until then, the Astral Stones and the Little North Star Astral Formation must not be compromised."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. If he revealed the "Heavenly Demon Transformation," and these people discovered that his body refinement achievements surpassed his cultivation level, trouble would surely follow. Fortunately, his senior sister was there to shield him.</p><p>Qing Jun preempted, "I will take him to open the restrictions. Before entering, I will personally seal his true essence to ensure that the Heaven-Pointing Peak remains unharmed."</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi and the Netherworld Demon Lord exchanged glances. The Netherworld Demon Lord nodded, "With Fellow Daoist Leng personally guaranteeing it, there should be no issue."</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Dongyang Bo did not attempt to obstruct the matter. "I trust that Fellow Daoist Leng would not deliberately damage the Heaven-Pointing Peak."</p><p>The leaders of both the righteous and demonic paths of the Cold Domain had now voiced their approval. Seeing this, Daoist Zhenyi pondered for a moment before turning to an armored general beside him, "Jiu Gu, you will accompany Fellow Daoist Leng later."</p><p>...</p><p>"You may leave now. Wait for me at the bamboo pavilion," Qing Jun transmitted her voice to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Yes! This junior takes his leave!" Qin Sang turned and left, feeling a wave of relief. He hadn't expected things to go so smoothly, with so little effort required to gain permission to enter the Heaven-Pointing Peak.</p><p>As he walked out of the grand hall, Qin Sang overheard the Nascent Soul cultivators discussing the ongoing war. He faintly sensed a subtle gaze lingering on him. He paused briefly before quickening his pace outward. For now, he needed to focus on honing the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" and could not afford to be distracted.</p><p>Returning to the bamboo pavilion, Qin Sang waited for a full two hours. As dusk fell, Qing Jun finally returned. The Tianxing Alliance Nascent Soul cultivator named Jiu Gu, along with a Cold Domain demonic path Nascent Soul cultivator, arrived with Qin Sang and immediately set off toward the depths of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>The Heaven-Pointing Peak constantly roamed within the Yun Cang Great Marsh. To locate it, the combined seals of the Tianxing Alliance and the Cold Domain were required to sense the peak's restrictions.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, the four of them stopped over a vast expanse of water. They took out the complete seals, infused them with true essence, and after a brief moment of sensing, changed direction and flew northeast.</p><p>After another stretch of flying, Qin Sang saw a familiar sight in the distance. In the night, a beam of light descended from the heavens, connecting the starry river above to the marsh below. A peculiar force flowed within the beam, and the water's surface shimmered like liquid silver, resembling a mirror. That was the entrance to the Heaven-Pointing Peak.</p>
