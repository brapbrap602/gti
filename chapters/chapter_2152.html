<h1>Chapter 2142: Funeral</h1><p>Liao Chen activated the grand formation, sending Qin Sang out of Purple Cloud Mountain and back to the previous sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang flew directly into the fog-shrouded sea, returning to the Zhu Yan tribe via a teleportation array.  The Yuan Xiang clan leader happened to be in his cave dwelling.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, did you meet that Ning Zhenren?" The Yuan Xiang clan leader asked directly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "I was fortunate enough to receive guidance from Ning Zhenren, who resolved many of my doubts. However, I still don't understand the connection between Ning Zhenren, Purple Cloud Mountain, and the Zhu Yan tribe. Why was the Yuan Xiang clan willing to give up two sacred land quotas?"</p><p>The Yuan Xiang clan leader gave a slight sound of surprise.  "Ning Zhenren told you about this as well?  Do you intend to send Qin Zhenren into the sacred land?"</p><p>"That is my intention, but I don't want to owe Purple Cloud Mountain any favors. I plan to find a quota from the Si You tribe," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"I don't know the exact details of the connection, only that it has been a long-standing custom. When I was young, one of my closest ancestors had been cultivating in the sacred land for many years. Even then, they addressed Ning Zhenren as a junior," the Yuan Xiang clan leader said meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Unless the other party's aura is completely unmasked, it's very difficult for a Nascent Soul cultivator to sense a Unity or Mahayana cultivator.  In his perception, Ning Zhenren was simply unfathomable.</p><p>Could Ning Zhenren be a Mahayana cultivator?</p><p>When Ning Zhenren mentioned Liuli, it seemed genuine and completely considerate, but Qin Sang wouldn't entirely believe Ning Zhenren's words at face value.</p><p>He was powerless and could only endure.</p><p>Whatever Ning Zhenren intended to do, he had to consider the consequences of defying them. If they were a Unity stage cultivator, there might still be hope to escape their control in the future.</p><p>The Yuan Xiang clan leader's tone changed.  "Zhenren, you've achieved a great victory. When are you planning to hold a celebration? I'll prepare some congratulatory gifts and sample some of Qin Zhenren's treasured wine. Several other clan leaders, having heard of your impressive achievements, admire you and want to visit. Some tribes are gentle and welcoming."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "Clan Leader Yuan Xiang wouldn't mind simple fare. I'll have someone send it over. But a celebration is unnecessary; it would only be a laughingstock.  I welcome other daoists who wish to visit. Ideally, I would be content with a place to live peacefully in seclusion. However, complete isolation is not a long-term solution; it only deepens isolation.  I don’t know whom I can trust, so I can only trouble Clan Leader Yuan Xiang to help introduce me to others."</p><p>The Yuan Xiang clan leader readily agreed.  "Certainly! Certainly! With the external threats removed, there is still much for Qin Zhenren to attend to. I won't keep you any longer. Until next time!"</p><p>"Until next time!"</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave dwelling, his smile fading. After a moment of reflection, he returned directly to the Storm Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>Li Yu Fu learned of Qin Sang's return and came to report, presenting a jade slip. "Master Uncle, the exploration of the Storm Sea is basically complete."</p><p>The Storm Realm had merged with the greater world, so it was inconvenient to call it the Storm Realm. Qin Sang thus referred to the three major regions of the Storm Realm, along with the territory ceded by the Chang You tribe, as the Storm Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang touched the jade slip with his divine sense, and a topographical map appeared in the air, its faint blue light illuminating the cave dwelling.</p><p>The map was very detailed, showing the entire Storm Sea.</p><p>The sea area where the Storm Realm and the Chang You tribe coexisted was roughly square-shaped.  To the east was the Nie River; the other three sides were surrounded by fog. Originally, only the Chang You tribe lived here, living peacefully and undisturbed.</p><p>Now, most of the sea area belonged to the Storm Realm, and the Chang You tribe was confined to the southwest corner.</p><p>Three chains of islands separated the Storm Realm from Sheng Mu Yuan. The Chang You tribe had built three strong lines of defense here, which are now all surrendered. Also, there were large expanses of open sea to the north and south of the Storm Realm.  Although there were no large continents, there were many islands and reefs, inhabited by many妖兽 . The Chang You people there had all withdrawn to Sheng Mu Yuan.</p><p>The current Storm Sea was vast and boundless for the cultivators of the Storm Realm.</p><p>Li Yu Fu sent people to travel throughout the Storm Realm and had explored the terrain, marking it all on the map.</p><p>"I plan to establish several lower courtyards in these places…"</p><p>Li Yu Fu pointed to several locations.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. The locations Li Yu Fu had chosen were all places with abundant spiritual energy and special locations. Occupying these places would allow Qing Yang Temple to be fully aware of any disturbances in the Storm Sea, clearly a well-considered plan.</p><p>"And here," Li Yu Fu pointed to the southwest, to the outermost of the three island chains. "This island chain is close to Sheng Mu Yuan, not far apart. If we press too hard, it's likely to cause friction."</p><p>In the disciple's opinion, Storm Sea is large enough to accommodate the three races of cultivators.  Preventing others from establishing sects here will avoid major conflicts.  Simply stationing some cultivators here permanently will suffice to prevent the Changyou Tribe from causing trouble.”</p><p>This suggestion followed Qin Sang's previous orders.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader's meaning was clear: the conflict between the Storm Realm and the Changyou Tribe was over, unless the Changyou Tribe produced another Void Realm Level 2 expert and initiated a new attack.</p><p>"Is anyone willing to relocate their sect or establish a new one elsewhere?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Internal and external troubles having subsided, the Storm Realm had become Qin Sang's cultivation grounds, but the most important step remained—establishing an altar for teaching!</p><p>The materials were already prepared, and preparations to begin constructing the teaching altar were underway.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang would use the teaching altar to rebuild the Five Thunder Academy!</p><p>One of Li Yu Fu's purposes in this exploration was to find a suitable location for constructing the teaching altar.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't plan to control the entire Storm Sea for now. Storm Realm cultivators were mainly concentrated in the Three Great Regions. This area would serve as the main body of his cultivation grounds.  Expansion would be considered after the grounds were established.</p><p>However, once the grounds were established, the Storm Realm would become Qin Sang's personal domain, and other sects and cultivators would be under his control and subject to the Five Thunder Academy's supervision.</p><p>Cultivators seek freedom and ease.  Some will always resist constraints. Many recently contributed to the great war; Qin Sang couldn't eliminate those who opposed him.  Even at the height of the Dao Court's power, this wasn't possible, and the Dao Court's downfall may have been partly due to this.</p><p>Qin Sang gave them a choice: those unwilling to be restricted could move out of the Three Great Regions. Of course, freedom was relative, and they would have to sacrifice certain things.</p><p>For example, with Qin Sang constructing the teaching altar and establishing the Five Thunder Academy, those willing to cultivate thunder techniques could receive the supreme Shenxiao teachings, regardless of their background, and select individuals would be chosen to become officials of the Five Thunder Academy—essentially creating a smaller Dao Court.  Those who moved out would, naturally, not be eligible.</p><p>Even so, some preferred to forgo these benefits in pursuit of freedom.</p><p>"I've sent messages to several sects and cultivators to inquire about their intentions. The larger sects are mostly hedging their bets, sending some disciples away. Sects wanting to relocate entirely to the outer sea are mostly Demon sects. The demon race is the most eager, particularly several major aquatic tribes from the East Sea; they've already chosen locations and are preparing to move their entire tribes…"</p><p>Li Yu Fu briefly summarized the current situation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised; the Daoist sects were the least friendly towards Demon sects and the demon race.</p><p>Those who wished to leave would be allowed to do so.</p><p>Li Yu Fu continued, reporting, "The academy has selected several talented disciples who will receive teachings and cultivate thunder techniques once the altar is complete, but they are all younger disciples.  Junior Brother Shen Chen cultivates the Chongxuan Sect tradition, Junior Brother Huan Hen is devoted solely to the sword path, and Daoist Friend Yu Nu is a demon cultivator; none of them are suitable for Daoist thunder techniques."</p><p>During the Shenxiao Assembly and the initial establishment of the Dao Court, many Daoist traditions were combined, requiring consideration of various factions, so no single sect could dominate.</p><p>The Storm Realm was different. It was Qin Sang's personal cultivation grounds, and the Five Thunder Academy, established by him, would naturally not be handed over to others. Key positions must be filled by disciples of the Green Sheep Sect and its allies.</p><p>"What about you? Have you considered it?" Qin Sang asked, looking at Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Although Qin Sang possessed superior cultivation methods, none were suitable for Li Yu Fu. Li Yu Fu still cultivated the legacy left by Yun Youzi and faced the predicament of having no cultivation path to follow. After entering the Divine Transformation stage, it was Liuli who helped him deduce the subsequent cultivation techniques.</p><p>Compared to the Dao Court's thunder techniques, the difference was immeasurable.</p><p>This legacy wasn't created by Yun Youzi, but originated from the Taiyi Danzong.  Leaving successors was sufficient; there was no need for Li Yu Fu to continue adhering to it.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was not only Yun Youzi's successor; Qin Sang had long considered him his disciple. While he might not be as outstanding as Shen Chen in certain aspects, he possessed decent talent, maturity, and the demeanor of a leader, making him Qin Sang's preferred candidate to oversee the cultivation grounds.</p><p>It would be a pity if Li Yu Fu ultimately remained stuck at the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Different legacies meant vastly different potential, and the Dao Court's legacy was undoubtedly among the best. Furthermore, by switching to the Dao Court's thunder techniques, Qin Sang could provide more assistance.</p><p>The thunder technique lineage was foreseen to become the Green Sheep Sect's mainstream and strongest branch.</p><p>"Disciple obeys Master's orders!" Li Yu Fu responded respectfully.</p><p>"You possess Water and Wood dual spiritual roots. The Water spiritual root is one of the most suitable for cultivating thunder techniques among the five elemental spiritual roots. After receiving the teachings, you will take my place in overseeing the Five Thunder Academy, temporarily serving as the deputy marshal…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a few more instructions when he suddenly sensed something and looked towards the sky.</p><p>Li Yu Fu exited the cave abode, then returned shortly afterward, his expression grave. "An urgent message arrived from the Witch Tribe. Daoist Friend Fang's vitality has depleted, his condition is beyond recovery, and he will soon pass away."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and rose.  "Let's see Daoist Fang on his final journey."</p><p>Li Yu Fu replied in the affirmative.  He made a hand gesture, and a phoenix cry echoed outside the cave. A colorful phoenix landed before the cave entrance, its body prostrate.</p><p>This phoenix was the Phoenix King.  It had distinguished itself in the previous battle.  Qin Sang, recognizing its innocence in the main conflict, allowed it to leave the demon army and become the guardian spirit beast of Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>The Phoenix King, demonstrating remarkable fortitude, willingly agreed to serve as the temple master's mount for three hundred years, in exchange for its freedom thereafter. Li Yu Fu, as temple master, needed proper conveyance when leaving the mountain, and after consulting Qin Sang, granted the Phoenix King's request.</p><p>The master and disciple mounted the phoenix and flew from the temple gates. Qin Sang released her true energy, enveloping them all, greatly increasing their speed.</p><p>The phoenix flew swiftly, traversing mountains and valleys, until they reached the Witch tribe's sacred mountain.</p><p>A young Witch tribesman, his face etched with grief, led a group to greet them outside the mountain.</p><p>"Are you Daoist Fang's adopted son?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The young man performed a deep bow.  "Junior Ming Qiu greets Master Qin and Master Li!"</p><p>"How is Daoist Fang?" Qin Sang said regretfully.  "I expected to have to wait another twenty or thirty years before..."</p><p>Ming Qiu's face was filled with self-reproach.  "My foster father exhausted his vital energy prematurely helping me break through... I am unfilial!"</p><p>Ming Qiu then led Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu into the sacred mountain to Fang Lao Mo's resting place.</p><p>Entering the chamber, Qin Sang saw Fang Lao Mo seated upon a throne, motionless, only a faint trace of life detectable.</p><p>"Daoist Fang," Qin Sang called.</p><p>The cicada wings trembled slightly, emitting a laugh, weak but still full of spirit.  "With Master Qin here to see me off, what need I fear on the road to the underworld? Ming Qiu!"</p><p>"Father!" Ming Qiu knelt heavily on the ground.</p><p>"You will be the new Witch tribe's Chief Shaman!"</p><p>Ming Qiu bowed his head, weeping.  "I obey!"</p><p>"Does anyone object?"</p><p>Outside the chamber, the Witch tribe elders bowed to Ming Qiu.  "Hail, Chief Shaman!" they cried in unison.</p><p>"Master Qin..."  Fang Lao Mo paused, apparently expending considerable energy. With great effort, he spoke, "... I have selected some promising young people, as you requested. Ming Qiu will instruct them.  And... if my people should prove unworthy and offend you, I beg you to show mercy; simply banish them, to fend for themselves."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "With the Storm Realm now peaceful, I hope the three tribes can live together in harmony, pursuing the Dao together."</p><p>Fang Lao Mo, in his cicada form, showed no visible expression, but his wings drooped, and his breath grew shallow.</p><p>"Master Qin, do you remember the Seven Killing Hall?"  Fang Lao Mo's voice was growing weaker.</p><p>"How could I forget?"</p><p>Images flooded Qin Sang's mind.  The past Fang Lao Mo, the current Chief Shaman.  The turning point in Fang Lao Mo's fate had likely begun the moment the previous Chief Shaman saved his life.</p><p>A long silence followed. Fang Lao Mo's life force was nearly gone. Just as they thought he had passed away...</p><p>"In this life..." Fang Lao Mo's voice was barely a whisper.  "... I have no regrets! I have not failed the Witch tribe, nor the... Chief Shaman."</p><p>Fang Lao Mo's body trembled. His wings rose high, and a long cicada song echoed through the sacred mountain. His last breath was a resounding cry.</p><p>Then, silence.</p><p>"Father!" Ming Qiu cried.</p><p>"Farewell, Chief Shaman!"</p><p>Around the sacred mountain, countless Witch tribe cultivators, who had arrived spontaneously, knelt and wailed.  Before the chamber, the Witch tribe elders also knelt involuntarily, demonstrating Fang Lao Mo's authority.</p><p>Li Yu Fu paid his respects.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, murmuring, "Daoist Fang, may you rest in peace."</p><p>Thus, the world lost another old friend.</p><p>The funeral followed Fang Lao Mo's wishes; simple, but with appropriate rites. Important figures were invited, such as the various lords of the Storm Realm.  Knowing Qin Sang was on the sacred mountain, far more people came to offer condolences than expected; virtually everyone of note who wasn't in seclusion attended.</p><p>Qin Sang used this opportunity to engage in brief discussions with various factions, planting seeds of information, preparing them for what was to come.</p><p>After the funeral, Qin Sang left the sacred mountain and returned to Green Sheep Temple.</p>
