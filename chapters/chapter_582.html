Chapter 575: The Seal

Between the fragments of land, space was turbulent and unstable.  Countless such fragments filled the inner hall. These fragments were pieces of a shattered land, almost devoid of treasure. Qin Sang was lucky; his landing spot was a fragment containing an ancient temple.

The real treasures were located on the largest fragment at the core – the true inner hall.  Those who entered via the jade disc were usually transported to the outer fragments. Only a few landed directly on the core landmass.

There was another ancient temple nearby, but Qin Sang didn't want to waste time.  He was alone and the chances of breaking ancient wards single-handedly were slim, so he didn't even bother going to investigate.

Remembering the maps given by Granny Jing and Yun Youzi, and comparing them, he easily confirmed his location – not far from the core continent. He concealed himself, accelerated his movement, and darted towards the edge of the land fragment.

The moment he left the land, a powerful force squeezed Qin Sang, making him grunt. He was simultaneously struck by two turbulent currents, caught between them, a very uncomfortable situation.

These currents were incredibly powerful and impossible to resist directly. Intruders could only drift along, waiting for an opportunity to find gaps and navigate through them.

Fortunately, the currents weren't aggressively hostile. As long as he avoided the fastest and largest ones, and didn't get swept into the void and lost, there was no life-threatening danger.

Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword.  He now wielded it with far greater ease than before.  Entering the currents, his figure instantly disappeared into the dense clouds.  Keeping the positions of the two land fragments in mind, he skillfully maneuvered through the currents on his sword, heading towards the larger fragment.

Soon, Qin Sang felt solid ground beneath his feet again.  He let out a long sigh of relief, glancing back with lingering fear.  It sounded easy, but it wasn't.

Some currents were extremely fast and erratic. If one failed to dodge, they would be flung into the void, making a return nearly impossible. He now knew how to identify these currents, making the journey ahead considerably easier.

After a short rest, Qin Sang continued towards the next land fragment.  He hopped across several fragments until he landed on a small, roughly square-shaped piece of land, no more than a few dozen meters across.  Leaning down, he finally saw the outline of the core continent!

It resembled a giant sleeping whale, floating serenely amidst the clouds, casting a massive shadow. It was clear that the surrounding fragments were torn from this core continent.

The continent was vast, with rolling mountains and occasional towering pillars of light, like shimmering neon signs. These pillars emitted powerful waves, still felt even from such a distance, causing one's heart to pound.

Deep within the continent, a mountain peak soared into the clouds, majestic and imposing, though extremely distant.

After observing for a moment, Qin Sang pushed off the ground and leaped.

‘Whoosh!’

A gust of wind rustled the forest, leaves swayed, and a figure landed in the woods.  Then, like a cheetah, it sprang up, moving incredibly agilely through the trees, quickly leaving the area.

Silence returned to the forest.

After a while, another figure quietly emerged from a different part of the woods.

Qin Sang cautiously observed his surroundings.  Like the land fragments, this place was devoid of people or even animals.

Reaching a mountaintop, he looked towards the central mountain, recalling the map and confirming his location.

According to Yun Youzi, the place where the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit grew was part of an ancient medicinal garden. Now only a corner remained, but it was still vast, containing many herbs. However, obtaining them wasn't easy.

The garden lay between where Qin Sang was and the Heavenly Mountain range, roughly at the edge of the continent.

Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had agreed to meet near the ruins of a city bordering the garden.

Following their plan, Qin Sang intended to rendezvous with Yun Youzi. If he wasn't there, Qin Sang would leave a message and scout the area alone.

He aimed to beat the demon cultivators, break the wards, and secure the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit if possible. Then he would help Yun Youzi obtain his healing method, and finally, search for Elder Qingzhu's belongings in the ancient temple where she disappeared.  These locations didn't have other contenders, so there was no rush.

However, he needed to be swift; delays could jeopardize Dong Yangbo and Chen Yan's plans, a situation that would be impossible to excuse.  

Thus, Qin Sang flew at full speed.

Having identified his direction, he spurred his ebony sword, dashing through the mountains.  Mountain ranges stretched as far as the eye could see, with rivers rushing between them.


Along the way, Qin Sang ignored the glittering streams, deep caves, and even underwater palaces. His goal was clear, and he knew how to prioritize.

‘Whoosh…whoosh…’

The mountain wind rustled the ancient trees, their leaves whispering.

Qin Sang sheathed his sword, landing on the mountaintop.  Looking down at the city walls below, a shock registered deep in his eyes.

Below lay an unbelievably vast ancient city, stretching beyond his sight.  No city he had ever seen could compare.

This was a celestial city!

Now, the celestial city was gone, reduced to ruins.  Desolate and overgrown, the houses were rubble, buried under weeds. Only a few sections of city walls, towering like mountains, remained standing, though heavily overgrown with vines.

But this wasn't what shocked Qin Sang.  What stunned him was a giant handprint in the city center!

The handprint covered the entire celestial city, deeply embedded in the ground.  Not only were the fingers and palm clearly visible, but several undulating ridges resembled fingerprints!

The surrounding houses and walls were destroyed by the handprint's shockwave.

Besides the handprint, there were no other signs of battle.  No sword marks, no knife wounds, nothing.

It was as if the ancient city had been destroyed with a single blow!

“Who’s there!”

Qin Sang, captivated by the ruined city, suddenly sensed an unusual disturbance nearby. His expression changed, and he quickly summoned his ebony sword, its energy surging as he pointed it towards the shadow of a nearby ancient tree.

The shadow stirred, revealing a figure.

“Qin, my friend, you finally arrived.”

It was Yun Youzi.

“Senior?”

Qin Sang quickly sheathed his ebony sword, utterly surprised.

He had been escorted by two powerful cultivators, heading straight for the inner hall without stopping. Even when separated by spirit formations, he had protective talismans and artifacts gifted by Dongyang Bo, minimizing delays.

Even accounting for the time spent traversing the fragmented land, he was undoubtedly among the fastest.

Yet Yun Youzi, traveling alone, had arrived before him and was already waiting.
