<h1>Chapter 1244: Trapped Foe</h1><p>Qin Sang, despite her formidable abilities, found killing Dongyang Bo no easy task.  Luring him into the demonic flames offered the best chance.  Therefore, before acting, she meticulously planned her attack several times in her mind.</p><p>She would first employ the Seven Souls Killing Array, catching Dongyang Bo off guard. Ideally, she would kill him within the array. If that failed, she could use it to obscure his vision and deploy the Eighteen Demonic Banners.</p><p>The ebony sword was a top-tier magic weapon, and the Seven Souls Killing Array was no ordinary sword formation.  Given enough time to master it, Qin Sang could potentially overcome her opponent's higher cultivation level.  However, it had weaknesses. It worked flawlessly against those of similar cultivation level, but high-level cultivators could easily see through it.  And Dongyang Bo happened to possess the Qinglian Treasure Lamp, which countered sword arrays.</p><p>Seeing the array break, Qin Sang rapidly manipulated her hand seals. Eighteen demonic banners materialized in the void around her, silently growing into ten-foot-tall banners. As the banners unfurled, even before the demonic flames were fully unleashed, the blood shadows within the banner array grew agitated, thrashing wildly, instinctively sensing danger.</p><p>The demonic aura then surged forth. The blood shadows near the banners stiffened, then silently melted away.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had lured Qin Sang into unleashing the Blood-Pollution Divine Light using his bronze treasure lamp, and used the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars to launch a surprise attack, his consciousness constantly scanning his surroundings.  While the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars couldn't harm the high-quality ebony sword, they slowed it for a crucial moment, exposing a weakness in the sword array.</p><p>In high-level cultivator battles, a split second is all it takes. Dongyang Bo seized this opening.</p><p>The ebony sword finally broke free from the Dragon-Phoenix Stone Pillars, but it was too late for Qin Sang to repair the array’s flaw or change its formation to stop Dongyang Bo.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A blaze erupted from the King Kong pestle, like a white rainbow piercing the sun, forcefully shattering the sword array's defenses. The array scattered.</p><p>A faint beam of bloodlight shone in from outside.  Before Dongyang Bo made any discernible move, he appeared at the array's weak point, about to escape.</p><p>At that moment, the ebony sword reappeared before him, leaping forward in a swift strike.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The sword was blocked by the King Kong pestle. Seizing the opportunity, Dongyang Bo broke free from the array.</p><p>As he emerged, Dongyang Bo was about to seize the talisman puppet when he sensed something amiss. He saw streams of black flames engulfing the surrounding blood mist and shadows, burning them to nothing and rushing towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating his move, had already deployed the banner array, the demonic flames striking directly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo’s expression darkened, but he remained calm.  He recalled Qin Sang’s banner array, having only witnessed it used once on the battlefield, and the incomplete information suggested it might be based on the demonic banners of the Kuiyin Ancestor, with two extra banners.</p><p>Even if the banners were comparable in power to the originals, Dongyang Bo was confident he could protect himself.  A cultivation level difference existed, and if the battle prolonged, Qin Sang would exhaust her spiritual energy first.  Dongyang Bo simply wanted to avoid prolonged fighting, not fearing for his safety.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, Dongyang Bo was shocked. Behind the sea of flames, eighteen banners billowed, not twelve as he’d expected!</p><p>Qin Sang had only been a Nascent Soul cultivator for a few years; her demonstrated strength already exceeded Dongyang Bo’s expectations, and this was clearly not her full power.</p><p>Facing the eighteen demonic banners, Dongyang Bo’s expression lost all its ease. He felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>"It’s the Ten Directions Yanluo Banners!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo had interacted with the Kuiyin Ancestor and knew the terrifying power of his banner array. Now, Qin Sang possessed eight more banners than the Ancestor.</p><p>This was no longer about seizing the talisman puppet!</p><p>Eighteen banners stood tall in the void, like eighteen gaping maws, spewing demonic flames. Qin Sang controlled the flames through the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>In an instant, demonic flames raged, the scene terrifying.  Waves of fire crashed towards Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Dongyang Bo felt a surge of alarm.  He looked around, finding himself trapped in a boundless sea of fire, with no escape. The King Kong pestle above him hummed, its flames pushed back by the demonic fire, dimming and wobbling precariously.</p><p>"The Kuiyin Ancestor's treasure, while powerful, has a flaw.  These demonic flames are external, not perfectly under his control. Against strong opponents, it might defeat them, but killing them is difficult."</p><p>Dongyang Bo surprisingly displayed considerable knowledge of the banners.  However, when the number of banners reached eighteen, it was a qualitative shift, not merely a quantitative one.</p><p>Dong Yangbo's mind raced, but he remained calm and reacted swiftly. He knew that if he didn't escape quickly, he would be consumed by the demonic flames and utterly destroyed.</p><p>Immediately, Dong Yangbo used all his strength to activate the Vajra pestle for protection. His figure flashed repeatedly, leaving only a streak of white light violently surging through the void.</p><p>For a moment, the demonic flames were thrown into chaos.  Dong Yangbo understood the flaw in the demonic banner array; a direct confrontation was suicidal. Qin Sang had to personally control the demonic fire to kill him.  Since the flames weren't refined by Qin Sang, the faster Dong Yangbo moved, the easier it would be to find openings in his defense.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. Dong Yangbo's actions had struck at his weak point.  He was indeed an old fox, quickly identifying the array's weakness.  However, Qin Sang possessed the Fire Lotus Seed, using the controlled demonic fire as a bridge, giving him an advantage over the former Kui Yin ancestor.</p><p>Unable to do anything else, Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the void, fully activating the demonic banner array, daring not to be distracted.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye butterfly also appeared, perching on Qin Sang's shoulder, its eyes wide open, intently watching the array.  First, Dong Yangbo was not yet at his wit's end; her lightning magic couldn't currently break through the Vajra pestle's defense.  It was better to prepare the Heavenly Eye divine light to counter any spells Dong Yangbo might use.  Second, Qin Sang needed her to concentrate on using the Heavenly Eye to lock onto Dong Yangbo, anticipating his movements.</p><p>The demonic flames raged, fiercely attacking the Vajra pestle.  A continuous clang echoed from the pestle, its light flickering.</p><p>Dong Yangbo tried his old trick again, using the Dragon-Phoenix stone pillars to smash the flames, but the flames were not solid; they dispersed at will. Seeing that the treasure was useless and he couldn't approach the demonic banners, he put it away.</p><p>The eighteen demonic banners were indeed formidable. Dong Yangbo's true energy was being consumed rapidly, and he soon felt that he could no longer maintain the Vajra pestle's power. He became increasingly anxious.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The demonic fire approached, and the impact caused Dong Yangbo's mind to reel, his spirit becoming unstable. He hastily activated the Vajra pestle to keep the flames away and took out an ancient bronze lamp.</p><p>The lamp was stained with impurities.</p><p>But Dong Yangbo couldn't afford to care. He poured all his remaining true energy into it.</p><p>The forced activation resulted in a 'crack' – the bronze lamp shattered, covered in cracks, with fragments falling to the ground, completely destroyed.  However, a section of the lamp wick remained intact, barely igniting a dim, yellowish flame.</p><p>Dong Yangbo's face twitched in pain.  The lamp was a precious treasure, but to survive, he had no choice.</p><p>He never imagined that a former pawn would drive him to this point.</p><p>The lamp flame could stabilize his spirit, but it wasn't enough to escape.</p>
