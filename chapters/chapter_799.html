<h1>Chapter 791: The Ambush</h1><p>He watched Lady Liu's movements.</p><p>Lady Liu was incredibly patient and resolute, lying in wait for who knows how long.</p><p>Hidden within the forest, she remained motionless, unaware of another presence lurking behind her.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Liu hadn't appeared at all.</p><p>Qin Sang grew more and more certain that something had happened to him.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the culprits were the ones he suspected.</p><p>Antidotal treasures were extremely rare; it seemed unlikely that the Lius would encounter other enemies possessing such items by mere coincidence.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>No one emerged from the Lake of Floral Fairies.</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the time. The Seven Kills Palace was about to close.  Continuing to wait like this wasn't wise; there was no guarantee the person inside would make it out alive.</p><p>Just as he frowned to himself, he noticed a stir on the ancient bridge.</p><p>Flower petals danced in the air as someone emerged.</p><p>"They're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, noticing the sword energy within the mist tremble, a clear sign of Lady Liu's agitation.</p><p>Qin Sang held his breath, remaining still, his eyes fixed on the entrance to the ancient bridge.</p><p>A figure flew swiftly from the Lake of Floral Fairies, and soon Qin Sang recognized the familiar protective aura shielding the newcomer from the pervasive poison in the air.</p><p>"It really is the Bone Lotus!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold, filled with killing intent.</p><p>He'd suspected it ever since he realized Lady Liu had set a trap.  Anyone connected to the Lius and able to enter the Lake of Floral Fairies was likely Xiang Yi or his companions.</p><p>Although he didn't know what had transpired between them, Xiang Yi was a ruthless man. It wouldn't be surprising if he'd conspired with Cui Ji and the other man to murder the Lius.</p><p>Xiang Yi, Cui Ji, and the richly dressed man were all on his kill list.</p><p>No matter who emerged from the lake, he wouldn't let them escape within the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his palm, concealing the Fire Pearl within his hand.</p><p>If it were Cui Ji or the richly dressed man, with his improved swordsmanship, Qin Sang was confident he could subdue them with his sword alone.</p><p>Xiang Yi, however, was far stronger. Having already used the Blood Defilement Divine Light, Qin Sang decided to use the Fire Pearl to ensure a swift kill.</p><p>He had originally saved the Fire Pearl for the Heavenly Tower, anticipating potential dangers, but hadn't needed it yet.</p><p>With their imminent departure from the Seven Kills Palace, using it to eliminate a powerful enemy seemed worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Fire Pearl in one hand and prepared the Ten Directions Yama Banner restriction in the other. However, he didn't act rashly, patiently waiting to assess the situation.</p><p>The mist stirred slightly, betraying Lady Liu's unease.</p><p>Finally, the figure reached the entrance of the ancient bridge.  Seemingly unaware of the ambush, he casually stepped out after a brief glance around.</p><p>"Cui Ji! It really is them..."</p><p>Recognizing the man, Qin Sang sneered inwardly. He hadn't expected to find his target so directly.  Eliminating Cui Ji first would be a good start.</p><p>"It seems Cui Ji came for the Bone Lotus.  Their deal must have been for it..."</p><p>Qin Sang pieced together their transaction, almost certain of his deduction. He was about to put away the Fire Pearl when he froze, astonished to discover that Cui Ji had broken through to the late stage!</p><p>Before entering the Seven Kills Palace, Cui Ji had been stuck at a bottleneck.  A single trip to the Lake of Floral Fairies had allowed him to reach late-stage Core Formation.</p><p>...</p><p>Cui Ji clutched the Bone Lotus, a triumphant look on his face.</p><p>Some of the lotus petals were stained purple, while others remained green. Only one petal was still intact, a clear sign that this treasure was nearing the end of its lifespan.</p><p>Cui Ji was elated and excited.</p><p>He hadn't expected things to go so smoothly.  He wondered if it was because he'd personally eliminated his rivals.  After finding the spiritual herb and consuming it, he'd sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough. Everything had fallen into place effortlessly.</p><p>...</p><p>With a smile, Cui Ji stepped into the trap.  A sudden ringing filled the air as countless red threads, sharp as blades, materialized around him. His smile instantly froze.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned his gaze towards the mist.</p><p>"What will Lady Liu do?"</p><p>The trap seemed inadequate against the now more powerful Cui Ji.</p><p>The thought had barely formed when a sword beam shot out from the mist like a bolt of lightning, accompanied by a furious cry: "Vile thief, die!"</p><p>Lady Liu had made her move.</p><p>Her trap was ingenious: the Red Thread Soul Bell formation would ensnare Cui Ji, catching him off guard, while she would then strike him down with her flying sword.</p><p>However, fate was fickle. No one had anticipated Cui Ji's breakthrough at the lake.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Cui Ji roared in fury.</p><p>The red threads, sharp enough to cut flesh and bone, lashed out. Even more terrifying was the bell's sound, which could assault the soul.</p><p>His former self would have been caught.</p><p>Despite his unstable realm, Cui Ji's increased cultivation allowed him to withstand the sonic assault.  Channeling his true essence, he successfully summoned the Purple Obsidian Pearl. A purple aura enveloped him, forming a protective shield.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A white light flashed as a flying dagger shot out from the purple aura.</p><p>The red threads proved fragile against the dagger.</p><p>Severed threads flew about, the bronze bell trembled, and the ringing weakened.</p><p>Cui Ji's eyes, fierce as a beast's, landed on the person who had ambushed him.  His expression shifted dramatically, replaced by shock.</p><p>"It's you! You're not dead!"</p><p>But his gaze quickly swept the area, finding only Lady Liu.  He burst into maniacal laughter. "Haha... So only you remain.  And you dare come here to die?  Very well. I'll end this today and eliminate any future trouble."</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Streaks of purple light shot out.</p><p>Lady Liu, her flying sword now approaching, had tears in her eyes, her face filled with anguish.</p><p>She had been so close to killing Cui Ji, only to have her efforts thwarted.</p><p>She was the weakest of the eight, lacking Qin Sang's protective treasures.  Facing the newly empowered Cui Ji, she felt utterly powerless.</p><p>"Heavens, why have you forsaken me, allowing this villain to break through..."</p><p>Her eyes were hollow as she lamented to the heavens.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The purple light struck her flying sword, deflecting it and disrupting her attack.</p><p>Suddenly, Lady Liu changed tactics, turning and fleeing into the mountains.  Having failed to strike, she immediately retreated.</p><p>Cui Ji was momentarily stunned before a cruel smile spread across his face.  He swiftly urged his flying dagger to break through the spirit array.  Once free, he gave chase.</p><p>As Cui Ji closed in, Lady Liu, her face filled with desperation, suddenly shouted towards Qin Sang's hiding place: "Fellow Daoist, if not now, when?"</p><p>Qin Sang, his presence revealed, didn't seem surprised.  He was certain Lady Liu didn't know his identity.  Her action was a clear attempt to divert trouble.</p><p>Cui Ji, now wary, would undoubtedly assume they were working together upon learning of a third person lurking nearby.</p><p>Lady Liu, after discovering someone else hiding nearby, had remained calm, feigning ignorance, and persevered with her revenge.  But on second thought, if Lady Liu had succeeded and seized the Bone Lotus from Cui Ji, she could have used it to hide within the Lake of Floral Fairies.</p><p>With the Seven Kills Palace about to close, the hidden observer couldn't wait indefinitely.</p><p>Still, her ability to instantly assess the situation and make a decisive move spoke volumes about her cunning and resourcefulness.  She was clearly not just a frail woman sheltered by her husband.</p>
