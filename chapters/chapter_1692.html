<h1>Chapter 1683: Gift of the Pill</h1><p>Among these individuals, the origins of Qin Sang's alternate form are the least clear.  Mo Xingdao, though a wandering cultivator who has long since made a name for himself, appeared as if from nowhere, prompting this question from the Holy One Huiguang.</p><p>The alternate form calmly explained its background.</p><p>Though using voice transmission, he was well aware that his true identity couldn't be hidden for long. Once this matter concluded, various parties would be able to investigate.</p><p>The Holy One Huiguang merely asked casually, showing no intention of probing deeper.  He pondered, "If the Demon-Sealing Stake is as the donor describes, merely fractured in the middle with its internal restrictions not severely damaged, there's still a chance of repair. However, I cannot guarantee success, and must first see the artifact itself."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the alternate form frowned, displaying some anxiety, hesitating to speak.</p><p>His thoughts were practically written on his face. The Holy One Huiguang, perceiving this, smiled, "If the Demon-Sealing Stake can suppress the ancient demon and prevent this demonic calamity, the donor shall be credited as the primary contributor. I will keep my promise and give you the Five Elements Pill. I believe no one will object."</p><p>He then scanned the others.</p><p>Naturally, no one had any objections.</p><p>In a short time, the demon's displayed power had already reached a level that filled them with terror. Their priority was no longer whether they could break through to the Nascent Soul stage, but how to survive.</p><p>The Holy One Huiguang was injured. It was conceivable that if the Holy King Qinghu showed any sign of weakening, they would have to face the ancient demon directly, without even a chance to escape.</p><p>The fact that the alternate form possessed an artifact capable of subduing the ancient demon was a welcome development.</p><p>It would also allow them to see if the old bald monk's promise was sincere, and whether he could obtain the Five Elements Pill.  Whether it would cause further trouble later was another matter.</p><p>Having received the promise,</p><p>the alternate form discarded his feigned apprehension and hesitated, "With all due respect to both senior masters, many years ago I unexpectedly obtained the Demon-Sealing Stake.  I was unaware of its origins, only that its restrictions were extremely profound, not from this era. Thus, I devoted myself to its study for many years, comparing it to my own cultivation techniques, achieving considerable understanding.  Further, based on the restriction patterns, I incorporated it into my own abilities, and it has even become intertwined with my very foundation.  I am willing to share my many years of insights to assist both senior masters in repairing the Demon-Sealing Stake. However, hastily separating from this treasure would undoubtedly shake my foundation…"</p><p>*That guy's trying to run!*</p><p>Fan Laomo and the others inwardly cursed. Only a fool would believe that nonsense about the treasure being connected to his foundation.</p><p>Yet they were helpless.</p><p>If they were in his position, after obtaining the Five Elements Pill, they would certainly also use the Holy One Huiguang's engagement with the demonic entity as an excuse to slip away.</p><p>The Holy One Huiguang was clearly not a fool. Even if the alternate form's account seemed plausible, he would not completely believe it, simply treating it as another condition for offering the Demon-Sealing Stake.</p><p>Considering everyone, the alternate form had the lowest cultivation, the weakest background, and numerous concerns, which were understandable.</p><p>A mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator; his absence wouldn't cause a significant disruption.</p><p>"As long as I see the Demon-Sealing Stake, I can determine its usability. The donor need not worry."</p><p>The Holy One Huiguang readily agreed, separating the alternate form from the Zen Arhat formation. After a brief moment of chaos, the formation reformed.</p><p>Freed from the battle array, the alternate form felt the pressure lessen. Taking a deep breath, he used the excuse of the crucial nature of his foundation and the need for undisturbed work, requesting permission to find a secluded cave on Emperor's Mandate Mountain to perform the ritual, stating it would not take long.</p><p>The Holy One Huiguang readily agreed.</p><p>However, before leaving, both the Holy One Huiguang and the Holy King Qinghu openly placed a mark on him.</p><p>The alternate form bowed deeply, leaped down, and landed on the mountaintop.</p><p>…</p><p>While the alternate form was negotiating with the Holy One Huiguang,</p><p>Qin Sang's true body had already taken out the demon banners, arranging them before him.</p><p>His fingers lightly touched the banners, the familiar icy chill permeating his bones and reaching his heart.</p><p>He remembered obtaining his first true Ten Directions Yama Banner not long after initially entering Shao Hua Mountain, killing a surviving member of the Kuiyin Sect. That guy’s name was…Sun De?</p><p>He then successively acquired more, until obtaining the opportunity at the Seven Killing Hall in the Canglang Sea to refine the other half of the Demon-Sealing Stake into a demon banner, gaining control of eighteen demon banners and becoming a prominent figure in the Northern Star Region.</p><p>Finally, he obtained the remaining banners from his senior sister, completing the Demon-Sealing Stake.</p><p>From Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even Nascent Soul, the Ten Directions Yama Banner had rendered distinguished service.</p><p>"Kuiyin Patriarch…"</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>He never admitted to being a disciple of the Kuiyin Sect, but ironically, he owed his current position to the Kuiyin Patriarch, and was still benefiting from his legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of reluctance at the thought of parting with a treasure he had possessed for so long.  However, once it was in the hands of a Nascent Soul cultivator, he had no intention of reclaiming it.  Whether Master Huiguang kept it or used it as a treasure to protect his sect from further demonic incursions, it would never return to him.  Perhaps, in ancient times, the Demon Sealing Stake was far more valuable than the Five Elements Pill.  But Qin Sang believed it was a worthwhile exchange.</p><p>The stake's use was too narrow; it offered no benefit to his cultivation.  It had previously served only as a container for the Netherworld Demon Fire.  While the unrefined essence of the Netherworld Demon Fire remained, Qin Sang possessed the Mani Pearl, which, upon acquiring it, he discovered could contain the fire's essence.  Dealing with future demonic encounters wasn't a concern for now.</p><p>This trade offered two major advantages: First, it would save his avatar. Not only was the avatar a precious Evolution Tree, but it had sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough, soon advancing to the late Nascent Soul stage.  Wielding a spiritual treasure and possessing the Ice Soul Divine Light ability, its combat strength would likely rival his own.  Furthermore, the avatar represented a second life; saving it was paramount.</p><p>Second, he would obtain the Five Elements Pill.  The pill's value meant that news of its acquisition would easily attract offers of any rare herbs or elixirs, including the Spiritual Insight Immortal Fruit.  Moreover, the cultivation world was ravaged by demons, suffering greatly, a sight Qin Sang couldn't bear. He was still far from achieving Nascent Soul Ascension, and he couldn't escape the situation anyway.</p><p>He sighed, lamenting the unpredictable nature of events. He had been considering how to repair the Demon Sealing Stake after refining the demon fire, even taking on a disciple for this purpose.  Yet, he was trading it away so soon.</p><p>The demon-sealing banners, storing the demonic flames, stood erect. Qin Sang's brow flickered, and a fire lotus spun out. Simultaneously, the Mani Pearl flew from his dantian, hovering beside him. The fire lotus gradually faded into the demon fire, drifting towards the banners, ultimately forming a fireball that enveloped all the banners.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  He changed his hand seals, and layers of fire waves formed within the demon fire, continuously gathering around the banners, creating a thick 'shell' around them.  With each movement of his hands, strands of the demon fire's essence were extracted from the banners. Gradually, the banners tilted and fell one by one, all the essence converging into one place.</p><p>The demon fire re-formed into a fire lotus, its core a dragon-eye-sized flame gently swaying. It was black, but more restrained and profound than the demon fire Qin Sang controlled. However, he felt an incredibly violent power emanating from it – a power he could not yet control, only pacified by the resonance of their similar origins.</p><p>“This is the demon fire's essence…” Qin Sang murmured, gazing at the flame. Had it not been for this obstacle, his spiritual sense breakthrough would have been far smoother.</p><p>With a 'whoosh', the Mani Pearl moved closer. Qin Sang guided the fire lotus, merging the demon fire essence into the pearl. He watched as the flame dispersed, its essence seeping into the treasure. Finally, the red glow of the Mani Pearl was overlaid with a layer of black fire, the essence sealed within.</p><p>He held it, sensing it carefully, confirming that both the essence and the pearl were unharmed.  Qin Sang nodded slightly, feeling the Mani Pearl increasingly resembling a demonic artifact.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang tapped his fingers repeatedly, sending streams of light into the banners. A bone-chilling coldness washed over him as the soul threads forming the banner surfaces disintegrated, eventually dissipating.  Qin Sang activated the internal restrictions of the Demon Sealing Stake; the banner poles instantly transformed back into their original form.</p><p>He now held two pieces of what appeared to be Xuan iron, the break remarkably clean. Qin Sang examined them briefly, stood up, opened the stone door, and sped through the Five Elements Divine Ban, heading for a cave.</p><p>...</p><p>His avatar descended from the sky. His movement caught the attention of others.  Seemingly casually choosing a cave undamaged by the Five Elements Divine Ban, the avatar entered, setting up a protective barrier to block perception.  For caution, he merged with the Ice Soul Divine Light, but didn't obscure his markings; his movements were always being monitored.</p><p>Once inside the cave, the Demon Sealing Stake arrived.  Receiving it, the avatar didn't immediately return. After concealing itself properly, it exited the cave, flew into the air, and presented the treasure.</p><p>"Indeed, it's the Demon Sealing Stake!" Master Huiguang exclaimed, his eyes sparkling as he received it.  After carefully sensing it, he joyfully announced, "The internal restrictions aren't severely damaged.  With some refinement, although I can't fully restore it, I should be able to temporarily mend the break and recover several layers of its power."</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King, observing the situation, visibly relaxed.</p><p>“I must channel my inner fire to refine this treasure.  Time is of the essence; I cannot be disturbed. I can only leave behind a sliver of my consciousness to maintain the Zen Arhat Formation.  The rest depends on you and the Saint King. Spread out, avoid direct confrontation, and try to engage the ancient demon in skirmishes. Above all, do not let it escape.”</p><p>Saint Hui Guang spoke, simultaneously communicating with the Saint King through divine sense.</p><p>“Old monk, you’d better hurry. I’ve called upon the spirit of my treasure, but there’s no response. The ancient demon has lost its mind, but it still wields its magical artifact with perfect control. Its power is overwhelming.  One hit is either death or crippling injury. Even with skirmishes, they won’t last long.”</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King spoke, removing the phoenix hairpin from her head and tossing it upward.</p><p>The hairpin split into four, transforming into four celestial pillars that stood at the edge of the floating lake.</p><p>The lake expanded, providing more space for maneuvering.  This only served to highlight the horror of the demonic body. It roared incessantly, the five elemental lights it unleashed causing the lake water to churn and tear, stabilized only by the pillars.</p><p>Everyone avoided its attacks, helping the Azure Fox Saint King share the burden, doing their best to maintain the formation.</p><p>Saint Hui Guang nodded, turning to the avatar, his tone light. “Sir, you are a remarkable individual of this generation. No wonder Elder Lu and you are such close friends.  Xing Ji has always spoken highly of Elder Lu, praising his integrity and character. It’s a pity that Elder Lu is so ambitious, having chosen a high-level secret technique from the Unknowing Mountain sect.  Because of flaws in the technique, he hasn’t made much progress for years.”</p><p>Saint Hui Guang clearly knew a great deal about Unknowing Mountain and Lu Zhang.</p><p>In fact, Lu Zhang was already famed as a genius within Unknowing Mountain, his reputation once rivaling that of Cheng Shenzi. After Cheng Shenzi's unfortunate injury, Lu Zhang was considered the ideal successor to the sect leader.</p><p>Top geniuses from prestigious sects like this are closely watched by other sects.  Regardless of the relationship between Unknowing Mountain and the Dewdrop Zen Monastery, they would have thoroughly investigated Lu Zhang’s background.</p><p>Saint Hui Guang, with his ambition to shape the world, had tasked Master Xing Ji with collecting information after his return. Knowing of Lu Zhang wasn't unusual.</p><p>A touch of regret flickered in Saint Hui Guang's eyes, a lament for Lu Zhang.</p><p>The avatar, however, felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Claiming a close friendship with Lu Zhang would be hard to explain without knowing these secrets.</p><p>“It wasn’t a flaw in the technique, but the lack of a vital spiritual object. Years ago, I traveled with Daoist Lu to Southern State and we captured a nearly mature stone toad.  After obtaining this spiritual object, Daoist Lu returned to the mountain and has been in seclusion since.  His cultivation should greatly improve soon.”</p><p>The avatar glanced at the poisonous king’s cocoon.</p><p>That incident had drawn the attention of the grotesque-faced man, triggering the subsequent turmoil.</p><p>While the Poison King remained imprisoned, he could still use his identity as the Xie Clan ancestor to deceive, but once the Poison King was freed, his connection to his true self would be revealed.</p><p>Whether the Poison King used his influence to pressure him or exposed him directly, it would be trouble.</p><p>Best to withdraw immediately!</p><p>“No wonder Unknowing Mountain didn’t send anyone to the Ullambana Festival,”</p><p>Saint Hui Guang said, realizing something. "The Xie family of Pu Mountain... I have some recollection. They were a prominent clan in Zhuo Prefecture, but fell into decline for many years, only recently experiencing a resurgence."</p><p>“Your knowledge is vast, senior. I am awestruck. I am humble and do not dare to be overly ambitious. However, I will never allow the Xie family bloodline to end with me. Otherwise, I would have no face to meet my ancestors in the afterlife.  Without the skin, how can the hair remain?  In stopping this demonic calamity, I will not hesitate!”</p><p>The avatar’s tone was serious and solemn.</p><p>“If all cultivators possessed your courage and resolve, this great chaos would never have occurred,” Saint Hui Guang sighed, then, without further ado, produced a jade bottle.</p><p>The avatar quickly accepted it, gently opening the stopper. A faint but pleasant fragrance wafted out.  Observing its color and scent, and carefully sensing it, he confirmed it was indeed a Five Elements Pill.</p><p>“Thank you, senior, for the pill!”</p><p>After receiving the pill and watching the two Nascent Soul cultivators remove the mark, the avatar didn't hesitate.  Under the curious gazes of others, he vanished into Emperor Bestowal Mountain, seemingly not in a hurry to leave, acting as if he was seeking a place to heal.</p><p>He didn’t notice the Azure Fox Saint King glancing at him.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang's avatar's retreating figure, a strange expression flickered in the Azure Fox Saint King’s eyes. Then, she glanced at Saint Hui Guang and looked away.</p><p>The old monk's intentions were crystal clear.</p><p>With the Heavenly Demon's sound unchecked, the Five Elements Pill is useless, no matter who gets it. No need for further investigation.</p><p>Those people don't know that the more opportunities they obtain, the closer they get to Nascent Soul, the faster they die.</p><p>Giving out the pills could eliminate one, or even several potential rivals for the Dewdrop Zen Monastery.  Clever old bald fellow.</p><p>The avatar returned to Emperor Bestowal Mountain, his figure melting into the clouds, entering the Seven Mansions Constellation Sword Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body was currently hidden within the formation, awaiting a chance to escape.  Out of caution, he wasn't in a hurry to meet with his avatar.</p><p>Suddenly, the true body's expression changed. A fierce light flashed in the avatar's eyes!</p>
