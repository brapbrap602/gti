<h1></h1><p>The halo of the Pagoda touched the light barrier at the entrance of the Exquisite Pagoda, silently merging with it. Qin Sang and Liuli, enveloped in the halo, passed through, smoothly arriving on the other side of the light barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang's taut nerves relaxed slightly.</p><p>The instant he stepped into the Exquisite Pagoda, the clamor behind was blocked outside by the light barrier. The interior of the Exquisite Pagoda was exceptionally quiet, the fluctuations of the flames unable to affect the inside.</p><p>When the piercing golden light faded, Qin Sang found himself in a not-too-long corridor. At the end, there seemed to be a large hall.</p><p>The material of the corridor was the same as the body of the Exquisite Pagoda, emitting a jade-like luster, making the entire corridor colorful.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense, quickly sweeping across the walls of the corridor, but he did not sense any danger.</p><p>Everything in the corridor seemed normal, as if there were not even any restrictions.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew that it definitely wouldn't be this simple. There were hidden mysteries within the walls, he just couldn't see the reasons behind them.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt the Pagoda tremble slightly in his palm. The sensation became clearer. The target seemed not to be on this level, but higher up, most likely at the top of the pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, took out the Drifting Snow Pills he had seized from Hall Master Yin, and shared them with Liuli and his incarnation. Every bit of recovery counted. Then, he took the lead and walked in. Confirming that there was nothing unusual, he signaled Liuli to follow, quickly passing through the corridor and seeing the scene in the hall.</p><p>The sight before them greatly surprised both of them.</p><p>The hall was completely empty.</p><p>Let alone any Dharma treasures or elixirs, there were not even statues or murals. It was a vain hope to analyze the origins of the Exquisite Pagoda and the stone stele space from any clues.</p><p>Just then, the Exquisite Pagoda suddenly began to tremble.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head to look, and the outside of the light barrier was already in chaos, a veritable dance of demons.</p><p>The group of demons had recovered and shaken off the fiery shockwaves.</p><p>They had expended great effort to pull the Exquisite Pagoda out from the depths of the flames, only to have someone else snatch the prize. How could they be willing to accept this?</p><p>What was even more hateful was that the Exquisite Pagoda had only allowed Qin Sang and Liuli to enter, blocking everyone else outside. In a little while, there would probably be nothing left.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had a Numinous Treasure, they were numerous. As long as they were careful, they wouldn't necessarily be afraid.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang and Liuli became the thorns in their sides, the objects of their hatred. The group of demons were unprecedentedly united, attacking madly.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda had broken free from its seal, and the flames in the circular platform were already at the end of their strength.</p><p>Under the combined attack of the demons, the flames were extinguished one after another. The ring of fire surrounding the pagoda was quickly consumed, leaving only the light barrier as a layer of protection.</p><p>Led by the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, the demons unleashed their divine powers, their attacks raining down on the light barrier.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc had already returned to his human form, his expression extremely gloomy, his gaze like arrows, as if they could pierce through the light barrier and shatter Qin Sang and Liuli into pieces.</p><p>He hadn't had time to look closely before, but Qin Sang now discovered that there were indeed many familiar faces, including his old acquaintance, Bi Fang.</p><p>He just didn't see the figure of Old Demon Hun, not knowing if the old demon was hiding nearby or hiding in the back to heal his wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed almost imperceptibly.</p><p>The restrictions in the clouds, the bone array underground, the spiritual fire within the cave.</p><p>From the outside in, the power increased.</p><p>But the golden light barrier was not as strong as imagined. Being constantly attacked by the demons, the golden light gradually showed signs of dimming. The Exquisite Pagoda trembled because of this, and the time it could hold on might be much shorter than Qin Sang had estimated.</p><p>This was too unreasonable!</p><p>The world was impermanent.</p><p>Accidents always came unexpectedly.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu and the others couldn't arrive in time, he had to uncover the secrets of the Pagoda and the Exquisite Pagoda before the golden light barrier shattered.</p><p>If he could control the Exquisite Pagoda, all his problems would be solved!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. His figure flashed, and he rushed towards the stairs.</p><p>Liuli followed closely behind.</p><p>The two of them quickly ascended within the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The second level, the third level, the fourth level...</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they reached the sixth level, with only the last level remaining.</p><p>The atmosphere became increasingly heavy.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged bitter smiles. The first six levels were actually all empty!</p><p>They had used a Numinous Treasure, angered a group of demons, and risked entering the Exquisite Pagoda. If they gained nothing, who would believe it?</p><p>They could only hope that the seventh level wouldn't disappoint them.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and quickly climbed the stairs, finally seeing something that the first six levels did not have.</p><p>In the center of the seventh level was a circular jade platform.</p><p>Three treasures were placed on the jade platform.</p><p>Seeing these, Qin Sang's gaze was immediately drawn to the treasure on the left, his expression revealing pleasant surprise, along with some unexpectedness and astonishment.</p><p>This was a fragment of a killing sword that Qin Sang was all too familiar with!</p><p>And it wasn't just one.</p><p>It was actually two killing sword fragments joined together!</p><p>Without a sword spirit, the killing sword fragments could not be perfectly fused. The crack in the middle was clearly visible. The two fragments together formed a complete "Earth" character!</p><p>"Earthly Killing..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the "Killing" character on the fragment in his hand and muttered, "Earthly Killing Sword, is that the name of this sword?"</p><p>The killing sword fragments he had been searching for so long were right in front of him.</p><p>But Qin Sang did not rush forward, staring at the killing sword fragments, lost in thought.</p><p>Because the scene here was completely different from what he had seen at the bottom of the Netherworld Valley!</p><p>The bottom of the Netherworld Valley was extremely desolate, filled with Netherworld energy.</p><p>Compared to the Netherworld Valley, the environment in the Exquisite Pagoda was too good.</p><p>That killing sword fragment had originally been inserted among the rubble, as if someone had hastily thrown it in, while these two looked as if someone had calmly placed them here.</p><p>Most importantly, where was the cultivation method?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, sweeping across the other treasures on the jade platform.</p><p>A long jade box.</p><p>A jade slip.</p><p>Faintly visible inside the jade box were four slender green threads formed by shimmering light.</p><p>Qin Sang directly skipped over the jade box and looked at the jade slip, beckoning with his hand.</p><p>Nothing unexpected happened. The jade slip trembled and flew into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense and quickly scanned the contents of the jade slip. The surprise in his eyes grew stronger and stronger. He immediately withdrew his mind and turned to Liuli, saying, "Quickly send a message to Hall Master Jiang, this place is dangerous, retreat immediately!"</p><p>After ascending to the seventh level, Liuli had stopped at the top of the stairs, remaining motionless. Facing the treasures, her expression remained calm, without any fluctuations, her eyes devoid of any greed.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, Liuli was stunned, not understanding why, but trusting that Qin Sang would not speak without reason. She immediately took out the golden toad given to her by Hall Master Jiang and lightly tapped its back.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>The golden toad spat out a pearl.</p><p>Liuli reached out and pinched it, her lips moving slightly. A white mist appeared inside the pearl.</p><p>The white mist wriggled and quickly changed, finally solidifying into several characters.</p><p>Liuli stuffed the pearl back into the golden toad's mouth. The golden toad's eyes moved, and with a *pa* sound, the pearl shattered, dim and lusterless, the white characters inside having disappeared without a trace.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang immersed his mind in the jade slip again.</p><p>The number of characters in the jade slip was not large, but the content was very rich, answering most of Qin Sang's doubts.</p><p>After reading the first part, Qin Sang finally understood the whole story!</p><p>The treasures of the Exquisite Pagoda, the seven-story Pagoda and the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter of the Pure Sea Sect, the seven-story pagoda of the Profound Heaven Palace...</p><p>Were all left behind by Xiao Xiangzi!</p><p>Even the sacred land of the Profound Heaven Palace was found by Xiao Xiangzi and the ancestors of several lineages of the Profound Heaven Palace. No one knew of this place before.</p><p>At the beginning of the opening of the sacred land, Xiao Xiangzi discovered the stone stele space.</p><p>After he left the stone stele space, he resealed it for other purposes, which was why the Profound Heaven Palace was unaware of this.</p><p>The content of the jade slip was written by Xiao Xiangzi himself, simply stating the purpose of all his arrangements, very briefly.</p><p>Qin Sang had no way of knowing the details. He could only combine his previous discoveries and imaginations to piece together a rough outline.</p><p>Before Xiao Xiangzi's meteoric rise, the Profound Heaven Palace did not exist. The Hidden Sun Realm, like the current Crescent Moon Realm, was filled with various sects, a scattered mess.</p><p>At that time, a legend of an ancient Immortal Sect was circulating in the Hidden Sun Realm. Xiao Xiangzi heard it and was greatly interested, summoning the various sects.</p><p>With the full support of the various sects, they actually found the legendary place, which is now the sacred land of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Considering that the various sects had contributed a lot, Xiao Xiangzi did not monopolize the sacred land. Instead, he used this as an opportunity to promote the alliance of the Hidden Sun Realm sects and establish the Profound Heaven Palace, letting them jointly control the sacred land.</p><p>His purpose in doing so was consistent with sealing the stone stele space.</p><p>Because before this, there had been a little-known demonic chaos in the North Sea, originating from the demon-sealing land below the Pure Sea Sect!</p><p>At that time, the demon lord was about to break through the seal. Fortunately, Xiao Xiangzi was already a Nascent Soul stage powerhouse and stabilized the seal in time, saving the North Sea from the demonic calamity.</p><p>But Xiao Xiangzi knew the horror of the demon lord. The power of the seal would wear down with time and could not last forever. If the demon lord's vitality was strong enough and he did not die inside the seal, there would be a day when he would break free, and by then he would no longer be around.</p><p>For this reason, Xiao Xiangzi made many arrangements.</p><p>One of them was to pass down the Buddhist Dharma, letting the Pure Sea Sect eternally guard the demon-sealing land and watch over the seal.</p><p>The demon-sealing land had the unique sound of morning bells and evening drums, which was greatly beneficial to cultivation. Nascent Soul cultivators could also benefit from it. It was a treasure land second only to the sacred land of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Another arrangement was here.</p><p>After Xiao Xiangzi entered the stone stele space, he found that the spiritual array here was very unique. If used properly, it could be used as a backup to deal with the demon lord.</p><p>Of course, the spiritual array in the stone stele space could not be compared with the demon-sealing restriction, otherwise Xiao Xiangzi would have lured the demon lord here back then.</p><p>At that time, the demon lord had been resealed. After years of torment in the seal, he would become increasingly weak. When he accumulated enough power to attack the seal again, his cultivation would definitely be greatly diminished.</p><p>At that time, the cultivators of the North Sea could join forces and have a chance to kill the demon lord.</p><p>If the demon lord was really difficult to control, he would be lured to the sacred land to be sealed!</p><p>The demon lord was bound to be very cunning, and it was not easy to make him fall into the trap.</p><p>This had to mention the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter that Old Demon Hun had obtained in the Pure Sea Sect. It was the best bait.</p><p>This treasure was an ancient treasure that Xiao Xiangzi had obtained in the sacred land, and it was closely related to the stone stele space.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had tried it. Once the sacred land was opened, it would be sensed in a large area of the sea nearby, and the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter would show anomalies.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi deliberately left the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter in the Pure Sea Sect to make it easier for the demon lord to snatch it, and then find a way to lure him to the South Sea and open the sacred land.</p><p>The Ice Demon Crystal was also personally refined by Xiao Xiangzi, and it was originally a treasure of the Profound Heaven lineage.</p><p>Even if the Ice Demon Crystal did not absorb enough power, at a critical moment, it could consume its origin to forcibly open the sacred land, but it would take longer to recover afterwards.</p><p>The demon lord was knowledgeable and would definitely recognize that the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter had an extraordinary origin. When he found a relic of the ancient era, how could he not be tempted?</p><p>As long as the demon lord could be introduced into the stone stele space, the spiritual array could be controlled, and the demon lord could be sealed here!</p><p>The array core that controlled the spiritual array was the Pagoda in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Holding the Pagoda, one could sneak into the Exquisite Pagoda and manipulate this spiritual array.</p><p>For this reason, Xiao Xiangzi spared no effort to comprehend the array formations in the stone stele space and find the key.</p><p>Worried that the demon lord would detect the anomaly and see through the plan, Xiao Xiangzi did not dare to change the spiritual array excessively, nor did he have the power to change it too much. Refining the Pagoda was already his limit.</p><p>Once the spiritual array was activated, it could not be reversed, and there was only one chance.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi was worried that someone would use the Pagoda to eliminate dissidents, wantonly slaughter fellow cultivators, waste the opportunity, and violate his original intention. Therefore, he divided the Pagoda into two, placing them in the Profound Heaven Palace and the Pure Sea Sect respectively.</p><p>Qin Sang had no way of knowing what Xiao Xiangzi told the two sects at that time.</p><p>Facts had proved that the world was unpredictable, and there were too many variables.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace had frequent internal strife, internal and external troubles, and after several devastations, it had lost too many things and forgotten the instructions of its ancestors.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect, either because they could not contact the Profound Heaven Palace and received no response, or because something unexpected happened, the entire sect perished together with the demon lord.</p><p>The secret was lost, and the stone stele space was sealed until now.</p><p>If the Ghost Mother hadn't opened the ruins of the Pure Sea Sect, searched for the sea chart, and attracted Qin Sang and Old Demon Hun, the Ganoderma Lucidum Scepter and the Pagoda would not have appeared until now.</p><p>The secret here might not have seen the light of day for who knows how long.</p><p>It would probably take Qin Sang a long time to determine that the killing sword fragments were hidden here, and he would have to find another way to open the stone stele space. It was unknown when he would be able to succeed.</p><p>The killing sword fragments and the jade box were the 'rewards' left by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi said in the jade slip that he had accidentally obtained a fragment and believed that it must be a fragment of a rare treasure. Unfortunately, he could not use it himself, and after searching for a long time, he only found another one in the Central Province, and there was no more news.</p><p>He believed that the other fragments should also have fallen into this realm, so he left these two here, hoping that later generations would continue to search.</p><p>As for the treasure inside the jade box, it was actually the Spirit Calming Incense that Qin Sang had long heard of!</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi said:</p><p>The disciples sent by the two sects, who dared to bring the Pagoda here, must be benevolent gentlemen who cared about the world, had the determination to sacrifice themselves to feed the demon, and faced death with equanimity.</p><p>The Spirit Calming Incense and the fragments of the supreme treasure are your rewards.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt ashamed.</p><p>Perhaps, he was going to violate Xiao Xiangzi's original intention.</p><p>He had to thank Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The Spirit Calming Incense was a supreme treasure to others, but what Qin Sang valued most were the killing sword fragments and the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>The second half of the jade slip was the sea chart of the Central Province that Qin Sang had been longing for, as well as some secrets of the Central Province recorded by Xiao Xiangzi!</p><p>The gains this time were so great that even with Qin Sang's composure, he couldn't help but feel a little excited.</p><p>He didn't have time to carefully examine those secrets for the time being. He opened his eyes, turned around, and looked down at the entrance of the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda was shaking more and more violently, and the demons were madly attacking the light barrier.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered a very appropriate phrase, and in Liuli's surprised gaze, he muttered.</p><p>"A vast expanse of white earth... truly clean!"</p>
