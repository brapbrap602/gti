<h1>Chapter 893: Rendezvous</h1><p>The cloud-mist vessel suddenly halted.  Those ahead proactively flew up to pay their respects.</p><p>"Daoist Qi, Daoist Hu…"</p><p>Master Lu returned the greetings, showing no disregard for anyone based on cultivation level or power. He treated everyone equally, including those from smaller sects.</p><p>"Daoist Moyu has arrived early as well…"</p><p>Master Lu bowed to a scholar, then looked at the person beside him, asking with some doubt, "And who might this Daoist be?"</p><p>"My dharma name is Mingyue. I'm not a cultivator from Lan Dou Island, merely passing through.  I happened to hear Daoist Moyu mention the grand Dharma Assembly on Dongming Island, and was moved to come and observe.  I trust Daoist Lu won't be sending me away…"</p><p>This person was Qin Sang in disguise. He knew his mask wouldn't fool the many Golden Core cultivators present, but showed no sign of discomfort.</p><p>He'd sent a clone to infiltrate Lan Dou Sect, while his true body had been searching for an opportunity.  He finally befriended a Daoist with good relations with Lan Dou Island not long ago:  Daoist Moyu, the mountain master of Moyun Mountain.</p><p>He cultivated a sincere friendship, without rushing to probe for secrets.</p><p>Daoist Moyu's cultivation was similar to his own, but Qin Sang, hailing from another realm, had far more extensive experiences than Moyu, who had spent his life in seclusion. After a discussion of Daoist principles, he greatly impressed Moyu.</p><p>The two hit it off.</p><p>Hearing about the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly, Qin Sang realized this was the perfect opportunity to make contact with Lan Dou's Golden Core cultivators.  He asked Daoist Moyu to bring him to observe the ceremony, and Moyu readily agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang seemingly didn't notice the clone behind the cloud-mist vessel. He bowed slightly, smiling at Master Lu.</p><p>Master Lu laughed heartily, "It's our great honor to have Daoist Mingyue observe the ceremony in person. How could we possibly refuse?"</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his true cultivation level.</p><p>A mid-Golden Core cultivator; this was enough to earn Master Lu's respectful treatment.  Like the others, he seemed not to notice the mask on Qin Sang's face and didn't mention it.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled his thanks.</p><p>"After landing on the island, Lu will properly entertain Daoist Mingyue. Please wait a moment, we'll work together to open the Dongming Island spirit array," Master Lu said, his expression shifting.</p><p>"Please proceed, Daoist Lu," Qin Sang stepped aside, flying a short distance to make room.</p><p>The cloud-mist vessel and other flying artifacts also moved to the side with the disciples of various sects.</p><p>On the cloud-mist vessel, the clone sensed a gaze, turned to see Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao standing on Yanmiao Pavilion's bamboo raft, and gave a slight nod.</p><p>Master Lu hovered in the air, taking out a circular talisman, and said gravely, "Fellow Daoists, assist me in opening the array!"</p><p>Old Daoist Huayang and others flew to Master Lu's side.</p><p>Master Lu threw the talisman into the air. Cultivators from Yanmiao Pavilion and other sects took out identical blue crystals and tossed them up, where they fit seamlessly into recesses in the talisman.</p><p>The talisman flashed, trembling slightly in the air.  Without needing Master Lu's instruction, everyone immediately channeled their true energy, forming streams of light that poured into the talisman.</p><p>Infused with true energy, the talisman suddenly shone brightly. A muffled thunderous sound echoed from afar, and tumultuous waves suddenly surged dozens of miles to their north.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Master Lu led the way, others following close behind.</p><p>Qin Sang followed to observe.</p><p>He had heard from Daoist Moyu that Dongming Island's spirit array was extremely intricate; only by possessing a complete talisman and finding the ever-moving 'life gate' could one open the array and reveal the island.</p><p>Master Lu flew to the center of the waves, threw the now intensely luminous talisman downward, and then everyone shouted in unison, exerting their true energy to the utmost.</p><p>The next moment, the surrounding void began to distort. On the previously empty sea, a shadow appeared—an island shrouded in mist.</p><p>"What an exquisite spirit array!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel, worthy of an array personally laid down by a Yuan Ying cultivator, the former sect master of Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue, please."</p><p>While Qin Sang was gazing intently, Daoist Moyu flew to his side, inviting him onto the island.</p><p>Others were already flying towards the island.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly activated his escape light, and soon arrived near Dongming Island, where he saw the dense mist parting at a narrow valley.</p><p>The mist was clearly a manifestation of the spirit array's power, and Qin Sang felt a sense of awe, respectfully following beside Daoist Moyu.</p><p>At this time, Master Lu dispatched several disciples from the cloud-mist vessel. "You guard this place. Only sect cultivators with Dharma Assembly tokens are allowed to enter the island."</p><p>"Understood, Master!"</p><p>The disciples flew to either side of the valley, while others passed straight through.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, a cliff appeared beneath them, revealing a deep pit far below the outside!</p><p>The pit was shrouded in a light fog, its interior indistinct, with uneven terrain and rolling hills, though not particularly high.  At its center, a mountain stood prominently alone.</p><p>The terrain reminded Qin Sang of a meteorite crater.</p><p>"That mountain must be Longxing Mountain," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Not far from the valley, a low mountain appeared before them.</p><p>Several elegant bamboo houses nestled in the mountains, green as new bamboo shoots in the mist, yet appeared long deserted.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please join me in the bamboo pavilion for a short rest.  We'll begin the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly at noon, after everyone has arrived. Let the disciples compete," Lu, the Head Abbot, said, his light fading as he turned.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced as the disciples, including Huasheng, disembarked the cloud boat, bypassed this mountain, and continued flying forward, disappearing into the mist in the blink of an eye.  Without revealing her thoughts, she flew into the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huasheng followed the acolytes and several others, flying over numerous mountain peaks.</p><p>On these mountains, the glow of restrictions flickered intermittently – the territories of various sects.  The Lan Dou Sect's was the largest, occupying almost half of Dongming Island.</p><p>Shortly, the Foundation Establishment cultivator ahead paused, produced a token, and flashed it at the mountain peak.  After a ripple appeared, he flew directly towards a row of stone houses in the mountain.</p><p>The houses on the mountain looked rather simple, but the group wouldn't be staying long.</p><p>"The Dharma Assembly begins at noon.  The spiritual energy here is abundant, especially beneficial for those cultivating the *Muyan Scripture*.  Quickly adjust your state and strive for a good ranking; it will benefit you greatly…"</p><p>The cultivator landed before the stone houses, turning to address the others.</p><p>"Senior Brother Ruan, you participated in the last Dharma Assembly.  Tell us about your experience to help us prepare,"</p><p>someone called out.</p><p>The cultivator shook his head, jokingly saying, "You'll win the prizes and not share with me, yet you always try to boss me around. Oh well, those who want to hear, come in…"</p><p>With that, he pushed open the stone chamber and entered.</p><p>The acolyte, having eagerly awaited this Dongming Island Dharma Assembly, immediately followed.</p><p>Huasheng quickly stepped forward and whispered, "Uncle Yang, before we left, Uncle Jin Yan asked me to gather some spiritual materials on the island to take back. I must…"</p><p>The acolyte impatiently waved his hand. "Your cultivation is insufficient; listening to Senior Brother Ruan's experience won't help you much. Go!"</p>
