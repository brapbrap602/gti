<h1>Chapter 1283: The Fiend</h1><p>"Which sect's disciples are you, daring to act recklessly even on the battlefield?" Qin Sang coldly shouted.</p><p>The group, led by Fat Chicken, was on the verge of breaking away from their own battle formation. Even if others noticed their peril, it would be too late to rescue them. Fat Chicken finally realized the magnitude of the trouble he had caused, a chill running down his spine, filled with regret and fear. Scolded, he stammered, unable to speak.</p><p>Everyone else was equally silent, as if holding their breath.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, recalling the Kirin Hairpin, and thrust it into the empty air.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A black shadow was forced out of the void. Qin Sang's hand seals changed, and the Kirin Hairpin transformed into a Kirin, which swallowed the shadow whole, then bared its fangs and claws as it pounced toward the Abyssal Cultivators.</p><p>The Abyssal Cultivators, seeing that a Nascent Soul expert had arrived, were terrified. They hastily formed a defensive formation, and the leader activated a blue jade bead in his hand. Under the cover of the formation, they retreated swiftly.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang pursued them, disappearing into the rippling waters.</p><p>Fat Chicken and the others exchanged glances, silently reorganizing their formation. After the recent danger, they no longer dared to act rashly.</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared in an open area, where swirling wind masses of varying sizes clashed with the lake waters. He had abandoned the pursuit at some point and arrived here, standing still.</p><p>After surveying his surroundings, Qin Sang's expression turned wary. He pointed his finger, summoning the Kirin Hairpin back to his side, and glanced toward a patch of dark blue water to his left, snorting, "Hiding like a coward! Such a mediocre concealment technique can't fool my senses!"</p><p>The water rippled, but there was no one in sight, not even a shadow.</p><p>After Qin Sang spoke, the water suddenly parted, and a figure slowly emerged, licking his lips. "Lady Luo is as vigilant as ever. It seems I still have much to learn about concealment techniques... It's been months since we last met. How have you been, my lady?"</p><p>The man held a flowered fan, dressed in luxurious robes and black boots. He was handsome, but his unnaturally pale complexion made him unsettling. His tone was frivolous, with a hint of lechery and eagerness in his expression. He walked out casually, unbothered by having his presence detected.</p><p>"It's you!" Qin Sang frowned, his face filled with disgust.</p><p>Earlier, he had heard Lady Luo mention several Abyssal Nascent Souls she had encountered in battle, so as not to be caught off guard if he met them. This man was one of the most frequent among them.</p><p>He called himself the Moon Wanderer, a demonic cultivator from the Abyss, skilled in the art of dual cultivation through sinister methods.</p><p>The women he preyed upon not only lost all their vital essence, which could never be recovered, but after draining them, he would turn the most beautiful ones into lifelike puppets, keeping them until he found a more perfect victim.</p><p>This man was infamous in the Abyss. If not for the Abyss's invasion of other realms and the temporary alliance between righteous and demonic factions, he might have already been dealt with by the righteous forces of the Abyss.</p><p>Naturally, the higher the cultivation level of his victims, the better. After the war broke out, the Moon Wanderer had set his sights on the Nascent Soul female cultivators of the Two Realms Alliance, particularly Lady Luo. It was said he had also harassed Binghan.</p><p>Fortunately, Lady Luo was strong enough to fend him off.</p><p>But over the years, many female cultivators from the Two Realms Alliance had been abducted by him, meeting tragic fates.</p><p>Lady Luo had once said that if the Moon Wanderer was at Twin Mirror Mountain, he would likely seek her out. She had guessed correctly.</p><p>Facing an opponent familiar with Lady Luo carried the risk of exposure. But there was also an advantage—Lady Luo knew the Moon Wanderer's methods well. Qin Sang quickly formed a plan.</p><p>The Moon Wanderer's abilities were mediocre, but he possessed an extremely powerful treasure—the flowered fan in his hand. Refined day and night through his sinister dual cultivation techniques, it was imbued with a lustful poison, making it difficult to defend against, especially effective against female cultivators.</p><p>If Fat Chicken hadn't been in hibernation, could he have withstood the lustful poison?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but entertain this thought, but he was interrupted by the Moon Wanderer's mocking voice.</p><p>"My lady remembers me, and my heart is comforted!" The Moon Wanderer lightly waved his fan, smirking lecherously. "Why not join me today, my lady, and together we shall ascend to the heights of pleasure, making the most of this fine night..."</p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p>Before he could finish, a sharp shout cut him off.</p><p>In the Moon Wanderer's vision, a dense green light erupted, and a hairpin shadow shot toward his face like lightning. As it approached, it transformed into a ferocious Kirin, opening its bloodthirsty maw.</p><p>Unhurried, the Moon Wanderer activated his flowered fan. The treasure flew into the air, its surface facing the Kirin. Painted on it was an alluring image of a beautiful woman, from which a pink, lustful poison surged forth, forming a naked female figure.</p><p>The woman's features twisted as she let out a piercing scream, utterly deranged and fearless, standing in front of the Kirin.</p><p>While activating the fan, the Moon Wanderer secretly squeezed a jade bead in his other hand, multitasking as he quietly summoned the power of the formation.</p><p>At Qin Sang's location, a stream of water descended from the sky without warning, transforming into a white dragon that roared toward him.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded. Under attack, Qin Sang did not dodge or resist, allowing the water dragon to rush toward him, trapping him in the formation's power.</p><p>*Splash...*</p><p>The waves surged, engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>The Moon Wanderer was stunned. He hadn't expected such an easy victory, but his instincts told him something was wrong. Before he could figure it out, he saw Lady Luo in the waves suddenly shatter.</p><p>The first to break was her chest, where a large hole appeared, but no blood spilled out. Her lower body remained curvaceous and alluring, creating an eerie sight.</p><p>"What kind of fiend is this?!" The Moon Wanderer was horrified. Finally, he saw Qin Sang's true form revealed, and his expression changed drastically. He suddenly understood, a chill running down his spine as he inwardly cursed.</p><p>He never expected his opponent to be so shameless!</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>A sharp, agonized scream rang out.</p><p>The female demon blocking the Kirin suddenly had a black mark appear on her body. She stiffened, and upon closer inspection, it was a wisp of black flame. The flame spread across her body in an instant, consuming her.</p><p>The Kirin's phantom had vanished at some point, replaced by hidden demon banners.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flame devoured the female demon, its fiery waves surging relentlessly toward the Moon Wanderer!</p><p>The Abyssal Cultivators had long heard of Qin Sang's reputation.</p><p>Especially his Demon Flame Banner, which had slain the Blood Demon Avatar of Elder Ye, a being comparable to the elder's true form. It was an utterly terrifying weapon, something no one wanted to face.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The black demon flame radiated a terrifying aura.</p><p>The Moon Wanderer was filled with fear, finally understanding why Elder Ye's Blood Demon Avatar had been forced to self-destruct!</p><p>In desperation, the Moon Wanderer hurriedly forced out a drop of his vital essence and flung it toward the flowered fan. The essence formed a blood-red talisman in mid-air, which flashed and merged into the fan.</p><p>The fan trembled, emitting a bloody light as a thick pink mist surged forth, forming a cloud of pink vapor.</p><p>Within the fan's surface, it seemed there was a space. Several naked women painted on the fan rushed into the real world through the pink mist. As soon as their figures appeared, the demon flame surged toward them.</p><p>The lustful poison, which struck fear into the hearts of many, was utterly powerless against the demon flame. It was incinerated in an instant, unable to affect Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>The female demon, having consumed her master's vital essence, was even more frenzied than the first. She let out a shrill scream, her appearance grotesque and pitiful.</p>
