<h1>Chapter 744: Hurricane</h1><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The storm descended.</p><p>Everyone was instantly scattered by the wind, their protective auras flickering incessantly.</p><p>As Qin Sang urged the Ebony Sword forward, charging into the barrier, he felt as if he were a leaf adrift in a torrential downpour, struck repeatedly by chaotic, brutal forces.</p><p>The group scrambled to regain their balance, barely managing to stand firm within the tempest.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled more True Essence into the Ebony Sword, activating its protective aura.  Engulfed by the storm, the world was plunged into darkness. The hurricane, almost tangible, raged with visible grey gusts tearing through the sky.</p><p>The sea was in constant turmoil, with monstrous waves whipped up by the relentless wind.</p><p>No other sound could be heard over the deafening roar of the hurricane and crashing waves.  The constant barrage assaulted their ears, their hearts pounding in unison with the elements.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>A massive wave surged towards them, building to a towering height of several tens of zhang before crashing down.</p><p>Their faces paled. The sheer power of the wave was terrifying.  Without hesitation, they all soared into the air to avoid it.</p><p>"Gather close, maintain formation," Xiang Yi transmitted his voice, rallying the group.</p><p>With Xiang Yi at the center, Qin Sang and the others huddled together, gazing apprehensively towards the dark, seemingly endless depths of the storm.</p><p>It was in the face of such overwhelming natural power that cultivators truly grasped their own insignificance.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi activated the restriction on his jade pendant, indicating the direction, and led the group forward.</p><p>The wind and waves raged on, growing even fiercer as they progressed. They bobbed and weaved, dodging giant waves, struggling to advance through the hurricane.</p><p>Qin Sang remained distracted, his eyes scanning the surroundings.</p><p>Having spent years in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he was very familiar with the celestial phenomena caused by spirit tides. The more he observed the hurricane, the more it resembled those phenomena, yet he found no trace of a spirit tide here.</p><p>Perhaps they hadn't ventured deep enough.</p><p>However, with their current cultivation levels, delving into the heart of the storm was nothing short of wishful thinking.</p><p>To withstand the hurricane, they had to constantly channel their True Essence to maintain their protective auras, leading to a continuous drain on their reserves.</p><p>In the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, one could seek refuge and recover during such celestial events.  Here, amidst the vast ocean, without even a small island in sight, there was nowhere to rest and replenish their energy. Depletion of True Essence meant certain death.</p><p>Even over this relatively short distance, the rate at which their True Essence was being consumed was beginning to unsettle some of them.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, how much further to the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>Cui Ji summoned the Purple Gloom Pearl, which floated before his chest, emitting a purple protective aura that reflected off his pale, bloodless face, giving him a rather eerie appearance.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned, glanced at Cui Ji, and replied, "With your cultivation levels, reaching the Seven Kills Hall before it opens shouldn't be a problem.  Fellow Daoist Cui, please remain calm."</p><p>The others could only suppress their unease and silently follow behind Xiang Yi.</p><p>They had flown for an unknown distance. Calculating the time, there was less than half an hour until midnight, meaning the Grand Sorcerer was likely about to begin breaking the formation.</p><p>The group increased their speed. Fortunately, their journey was relatively smooth, and they arrived at the Seven Kills Hall without incident.</p><p>"We're here!" Xiang Yi exclaimed softly.</p><p>Everyone's eyes lit up. Following Xiang Yi's gaze, they gasped in astonishment.</p><p>Before them stood a wall of grey air, a wall of wind.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they realized this wind wall was merely a part of the hurricane's edge.</p><p>This grey air was the hurricane's force condensed to its extreme. The surrounding hurricane seemed to converge here, forming a storm cloud-like mass.</p><p>They could only see a portion of it, unable to comprehend its true scale.</p><p>Below the wind wall, a massive chasm and whirlpool had formed, like a funnel in the sea.  At its edge, a curtain of water several tens of zhang high poured inwards.  Endless seawater was sucked into the vortex, yet it never seemed to fill.</p><p>The hurricane and the whirlpool were connected, forming a single entity.</p><p>Xiang Yi signaled them to stop.</p><p>Upon their arrival, the hurricane had intensified.</p><p>They had to exert all their power to maintain their protective auras and avoid being blown away. Venturing further, if they were caught by the hurricane or sucked into the whirlpool, the consequences would undoubtedly be dire.</p><p>They hovered in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered seeing layers of clouds and the Heavenly Gate of the Purple Star Hall before entering.  Here, there was nothing but the endless grey hurricane.</p><p>He couldn't tell if the Seven Kills Hall was hidden within the depths of the hurricane or within the underwater vortex.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, noticing other cultivators had already arrived. Some were alone, while others, like them, had formed groups.</p><p>Everyone remained patiently outside, awaiting the opening of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, scrutinizing the hurricane and whirlpool, but couldn't find the Grand Sorcerer of the Wu Clan or the Nascent Soul Patriarchs who had arrived earlier.</p><p>Their current location was only on one side of the hurricane.</p><p>According to Xiang Yi, the hurricane and whirlpool were roughly circular. Cultivators with tokens, like themselves, were stationed at the edge, waiting for the signal indicating the opening of the Immortal Formation.</p><p>"This hurricane is terrifying. Only legendary Immortal Formations can create such a fearsome phenomenon. It shows no signs of weakening. Aside from the lack of spatial rifts, it feels much like the Eye of the Wind outside the Purple Star Hall. I wonder if the inside is as dangerous and terrifying as the Immortal Formation within the Purple Star Hall.  The Xiao Han Domain, with the aid of the Small North Star Essence Formation, and only after the Purple Star Hall emerged on its own, dared to venture inside… How does the Grand Sorcerer of the Wu Clan intend to forcibly break this formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to explore the area, hoping to find the Grand Sorcerer and witness the formation-breaking process firsthand.</p><p>However, seeing that Xiang Yi had no such intention, he abandoned the idea.</p><p>Soon, Xiang Yi answered his question. "The Grand Sorcerer and the Nascent Soul Patriarchs have already entered the depths of the hurricane and reached the Immortal Formation.  No matter where we stand, we won't be able to witness the process. We must patiently await the signal. The moment to enter the formation will be fleeting. Everyone, remember to stay focused and not get distracted, lest you miss this crucial opportunity…"</p><p>Before he could finish, they suddenly sensed a powerful aura rapidly approaching. Before they could react, it whizzed past them, appearing before the wind wall, revealing an elderly man in grey robes.</p><p>"Cloud Recluse," the Liu couple whispered, recognizing the man. "He's a renowned rogue cultivator from the Inner Sea, with extensive connections in both the righteous and demonic sects. He controls an entire island. We were fortunate enough to meet him once."</p><p>Undoubtedly, Cloud Recluse was a Nascent Soul Patriarch.</p><p>He paused briefly before the wind wall, took out a stylus made of black iron, and gently drew a line on the wall. A black light flashed in the air.</p><p>Seemingly without effort, a gap opened in the wind wall.</p><p>The old man vanished, and the gap slowly closed.</p>
