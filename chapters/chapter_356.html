<h1>Chapter 349: Cloud Thunder Crown</h1><p>After luring Liang Yan out, Qin Sang followed his original plan. Using the Spirit Concealment Art, he disguised his cultivation level as early Foundation Establishment and pretended to be unaware of being followed, enticing Liang Yan to attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liang Yan was so patient, waiting until now to make his move.</p><p>This also gave Qin Sang enough time to prepare.</p><p>Feigning a soul injury, he lured Liang Yan into the trap. First, the Yin-Yang Compass disrupted Liang Yan's Soul Binding Rope. Immediately afterward, the Ten Yama King Formation unfolded, successfully trapping Liang Yan within.</p><p>How could Liang Yan not recognize the signature artifact of the Kui Yin Sect? His expression changed drastically, and he cried out, "The Ten Yama King Formation!"</p><p>By now, Liang Yan knew he had been set up!</p><p>Who was this opponent?</p><p>Why target him?</p><p>Why did the Heart-Eating Insect Gu fail?</p><p>Thoughts raced through Liang Yan's mind, but he understood that none of these mattered now.</p><p>He knew the terror of the Ten Yama King Formation. His only remaining thought was to escape this formation as quickly as possible. Only by escaping this ghost formation did he have a chance to counterattack and survive; otherwise, death was certain!</p><p>"Cloud Thunder Crown!"</p><p>Liang Yan abruptly let out a low shout, and his head suddenly radiated a blinding silver light.</p><p>Beneath the hood on Liang Yan's head, he had been wearing an ordinary headband, holding back his long hair. At this moment, the headband's form suddenly changed dramatically; it was actually an artifact!</p><p>The headband transformed into an exquisite crown. The ribbons hanging from the crown resembled miniature rainbows, and around the rainbows, auspicious clouds swirled.</p><p>Radiant and magnificent!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A thunderclap echoed out of nowhere.</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The auspicious clouds turned menacing, transforming into thunderclouds, radiating righteous and pure thunder power.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>Lightning surged, and Liang Yan's body was bathed in dazzling thunder light, protected by the Cloud Thunder Crown, as if walking amidst lightning.</p><p>The Yin Soul Threads were actually blocked by the cloud thunder power, unable to reach his soul.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had quietly emerged from the swamp. Seeing this scene, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. Liang Yan's artifact, the Cloud Thunder Crown, was extraordinary. The cloud thunder power contained within was the nemesis of evil.</p><p>Upon contact with the cloud thunder power, the Yin Soul Threads were struck by lightning, severed inch by inch, their power greatly diminished.  It was unlikely they could break through the defense in a short time.</p><p>This way, the most potent means of the Ten Yama King Formation was restricted.</p><p>Such a specialized artifact was likely prepared by Liang Yan specifically to counter the Ten Yama King Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and without hesitation, he reached for his waist. The Corpse Puppet, refined from the accomplice of Dai Yue, flew out from the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>This person had been at the mid Foundation Establishment stage during his life. Refined into a Corpse Puppet, he could still play a certain role in this battle.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet charged into the Ten Yama King Formation, its figure like lightning. In an instant, it closed in behind Liang Yan, its fist imbued with extremely cold Earth Yin Qi, aiming straight for Liang Yan's back.</p><p>Sensing the fierce wind behind him, Liang Yan hastily dodged to the side, extending a finger towards the Corpse Puppet. A black stone, spinning rapidly, shot out from his fingertip.</p><p>This stone was initially tiny, only the size of a fingernail, but it grew with the wind, instantly becoming a boulder, smashing down on the Corpse Puppet with the force of a mountain.</p><p>The boulder was enveloped in a gale, black smoke billowing, truly resembling a ferocious black dragon, hence the name Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>Even from outside the formation, Qin Sang could feel the oppressive force emanating from the Black Dragon Stone.  This artifact was as heavy as a thousand jun, no exaggeration.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang dared not let the Corpse Puppet take this blow head-on.</p><p>The Corpse Puppet hastily retreated, crossing its arms to block.</p><p>A muffled sound echoed as the Corpse Puppet was sent flying by the Black Dragon Stone, its figure retreating explosively. It nearly flew out of the Ten Yama King Formation before finally managing to stabilize itself. Deep dents appeared on its two arms; they had almost been broken by the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>Liang Yan relentlessly pursued, urging the Black Dragon Stone to continue its attack.  At the same time, he moved swiftly, attempting to use the Black Dragon Stone to clear a path and break out of the formation.</p><p>With the Black Dragon Stone's momentum at its peak, the Corpse Puppet alone couldn't restrain Liang Yan. Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately changed his tactics, leaving a portion of the Yin Soul Threads to continue entangling Liang Yan.  Simultaneously, he channeled a part of the formation's power, forming a ferocious and menacing evil ghost.</p><p>The evil ghost manifested, lunging at Liang Yan without hesitation.</p><p>At the same time, Earth Yin Qi surged around the Corpse Puppet, and its injuries instantly healed. It charged back into the fray.</p><p>In an instant, Liang Yan was caught between the attacks of the evil ghost and the Corpse Puppet.</p><p>The evil ghost and the Corpse Puppet would strike and retreat, avoiding direct confrontation with the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>With only the Black Dragon Stone as his weapon, although incredibly agile, Liang Yan couldn't help but struggle to defend against both sides.  Meanwhile, the Cloud Thunder Crown on his head was still under constant assault from the Yin Soul Threads, and the cloud thunder power was rapidly depleting.</p><p>At this point, Liang Yan's heart was filled with anxiety. The Cloud Thunder Crown's power wasn't infinite. If he couldn't escape soon, once the cloud thunder power was exhausted and the Yin Soul Threads broke through, he would become nothing more than a lamb waiting to be slaughtered!</p><p>Liang Yan let out a low shout, channeling his spiritual power with all his might, summoning the Soul Binding Rope back to him.</p><p>*Whoosh…!*</p><p>The Soul Binding Rope transformed into a bolt of lightning, twisting and turning as it caught up to the Corpse Puppet. The Corpse Puppet dodged left and right, but it couldn't escape. It was caught and firmly bound by the Soul Binding Rope.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Black Dragon Stone locked onto the evil ghost, smashing down hard.</p><p>Just as the Black Dragon Stone was about to crush the evil ghost into pieces, Liang Yan's expression changed drastically.</p><p>Behind him, a sword shadow suddenly appeared, having lain hidden for who knows how long, choosing this moment to launch a sneak attack!</p><p>By the time Liang Yan noticed the Ebony Wood Sword, it was too late.</p><p>In shock, Liang Yan did his utmost to protect his vital points, but unexpectedly, the Ebony Wood Sword's target wasn't him, but the thunderclouds above his head.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A loud bang echoed as the thunderclouds were shattered. The Cloud Thunder Crown itself was also struck, instantly covered in cracks, and destroyed.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Liang Yan cried out in terror.  Qin Sang remained deaf to his pleas, mercilessly activating the Ten Yama King Formation.  The overwhelming Yin Soul Threads, in the blink of an eye, annihilated the remnants of the cloud thunder power on Liang Yan's body and began to assault his soul.</p><p>"Ah…"</p><p>This time, it was Liang Yan who screamed, clutching his head, seemingly driven mad. He made a final struggle, urging the Black Dragon Stone to crash around him.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered repeatedly, easily dodging the Black Dragon Stone's impacts, and he swept to Liang Yan's side. With a flick of his wrist, the Sky Poison Silk transformed into a cloud of poisonous miasma, enveloping Liang Yan.</p><p>Facing the combined assault of the Yin Soul Threads and the Sky Poison Silk, Liang Yan had no chance to resist.</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone and the Soul Binding Rope lost their effectiveness almost simultaneously, their spiritual light dimming as they fell to the ground, seemingly about to be swallowed by the swamp.  A surge of spiritual power swept down from above, snatching them up.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the two artifacts and glanced at the captured Liang Yan.</p><p>From the moment he took the bait and was lured out of the Windscour Trading Post by the Heart-Eating Insect, his fate had been sealed.  Liang Yan not having Shi Hong by his side also allowed Qin Sang to act without reservation, striking with full force.</p><p>The only unexpected factor was the Cloud Thunder Crown, which was actually able to resist the Yin Soul Threads, forcing Qin Sang to expend extra effort. Fortunately, it didn't affect the final outcome.</p>
