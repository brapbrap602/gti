<h1>Chapter 1522: Sect Relocation (4k)</h1><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>After meeting with Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang spent a month traveling everywhere, visiting old friends. Most of his time was spent in the Lesser Chill Domain. It was like retracing half of his cultivation path. Having cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang's state of mind wouldn't be greatly affected by this journey. His purpose was simply to take a look and reminisce about the past. After departing for the Central Province, he didn't know when he would be able to return.</p><p>After making the rounds, Qin Sang finally arrived at Peach Blossom Valley. Unable to return to the Seven Kill Palace to commemorate Senior Qing Zhu's final masterpiece, he could only pay his respects at his tomb.</p><p>Inside the wooden pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang placed four wine cups on the table. He had tried to be frugal, but his treasured Peach Blossom Wine was almost gone. This Peach Blossom Wine was meticulously brewed by Senior Sister Qing Jun, sweet, clear, and far surpassing others. Qin Sang didn't know how to brew it, nor did he want to learn.</p><p>He raised his cup.</p><p>One cup to honor Qing Zhu.</p><p>Two cups to pay respects to Senior Sister and Bai from afar.</p><p>...</p><p>Green Ram Monastery.</p><p>The restricted area was packed. Li Yufu, Shangguan Lifeng, Aunt Mei, Zhao Ying, and other renowned Golden Core cultivators were all present.</p><p>"Senior Brother, I wonder what major announcement the Monastery Master will make this time? Could it be that he brought back some treasure from the North Sea?" Zhao Ying walked beside Li Yufu and asked softly.</p><p>Zhao Ying had the least interaction with Qin Sang, her prior understanding limited to various rumors. She held Qin Sang in both awe and respect. After Qing Jun's ascension, she joined the Green Ram Monastery, initially worried about being ostracized. However, she found that the Green Ram Monastery had a culture of mutual respect and affection, without any power struggles, giving her a true sense of belonging.</p><p>"Junior Brother Tan has always handled the sect's affairs. If there are any major movements within the Monastery, Junior Brother Tan should be the most informed. Why isn't he here?" Aunt Mei interjected, looking around. She couldn't find Tan Yi'en.</p><p>"Senior Sister has just returned, so you may not know yet," Bai Hanqiu said with a trace of envy. "Senior Brother Tan has struck it rich. Senior Tan and the Monastery Master reunited in the North Sea and returned together. Moreover, Senior Tan is already a Nascent Soul cultivator. The Monastery Master has invited Senior Tan to be the Grand Elder of the Green Ram Monastery."</p><p>"Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Aunt Mei was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>The stronger the Green Ram Monastery, the more its disciples would benefit. Jing Yu was close to the Green Ram Monastery, but more like a guest official. The Green Ram Monastery was still in its initial stages, with only a Monastery Master and no elders. Tan Hao was the first.</p><p>After her initial joy, Aunt Mei remembered something and said with a charming smile, "I'm afraid Junior Brother Tan won't be able to continue living a carefree life, will he? Before, I was very envious that he could avoid the hardships of cultivation."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu shrugged. Just as she was about to say something, the mist in the restricted area surged and parted, forming a small path. Qin Sang's voice came from within, calling for Li Yufu and the others to enter.</p><p>The crowd became solemn and silent, their expressions respectful. They looked straight ahead and walked into the restricted area.</p><p>Qin Sang had just returned from the Green Ram Monastery's spirit vein, where he had planted the root of the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, set up restrictions, and carefully nurtured it.</p><p>"Greetings, Monastery Master!"</p><p>Li Yufu and the others bowed in unison.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, instructing them to rise. He pointed to Tan Hao sitting beside him and said, "From now on, Brother Tan will be the Grand Elder of the Green Ram Monastery. Seeing Elder Tan is equivalent to seeing me."</p><p>Tan Yi'en stood behind Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't clear on how this father and son communicated. He only knew that Tan Yi'en continued to do as he pleased, while Tan Hao had a helpless expression.</p><p>"Your disciple obeys! Greetings, Elder Tan!"</p><p>Only after bowing did Li Yufu and the others dare to sneak a glance at Tan Hao. They saw that he was tall and imposing, with a heroic bearing. They had all heard the story of Qin Sang and Tan Hao from Tan Yi'en, and knew that this person was a man of great loyalty and righteousness, a true hero. They couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration.</p><p>Tan Hao returned the greeting with cupped hands, looking at the outstanding younger generation. He nodded in approval, praising Qin Sang for not only advancing rapidly himself, but also for being able to establish the framework of a sect.</p><p>After introducing Tan Hao, Qin Sang announced two more major events: the relocation of the sect and the passing of the Monastery Master position to Li Yufu. He originally wanted Tan Hao, the highest-cultivation cultivator, to take the helm, but Tan Hao firmly refused.</p><p>One shocking piece of news after another stunned the disciples, leaving them dizzy and disoriented. They couldn't believe their ears, and it took a long time for them to barely digest it.</p><p>Qin Sang was resolute. He had already made plans for the sect's arrangements, and his orders were issued methodically.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned Li Yufu and the others individually.</p><p>Li Yufu accepted the heavy responsibility of Monastery Master, but requested Qin Sang to remain in the North Star Realm. Although he longed for a broader world, he understood that cultivation was paramount. He planned to continue cultivating diligently until he reached the peak of the Golden Core stage and encountered the Nascent Soul bottleneck. Only then would he go to the North Sea to seek opportunities.</p><p>Another reason was that the situation in the North Sea was complex and turbulent, with far more intense conflicts than in the North Star Realm. Compared to large forces like the Profound Sky Palace, the Green Ram Monastery was still very weak. Tan Hao had to personally stay in the North Sea to protect it, and even Jing Yu would often need to lend a hand. The North Star Realm was the Green Ram Monastery's rear base, and someone of sufficiently high status had to remain there to oversee it. Li Yufu was the best choice.</p><p>The second was Aunt Mei.</p><p>Without hesitation, she requested Qin Sang to take her to the North Sea. Previously, she had been bound by the responsibilities of the Demon Flame Sect. After Qin Sang's return, Aunt Mei relinquished her burdens, finally able to follow her heart. Without hindering her cultivation, she traveled extensively whenever she had the opportunity, her footprints covering almost the entire North Star Realm. She had encountered opportunities and dangers.</p><p>Learning that the Three Realms of the North Sea were far broader and more exciting than the North Star Realm, Aunt Mei's eyes lit up, almost unable to wait a moment longer. If Qin Sang agreed to take her to the Central Province, Aunt Mei probably wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>The third was Shangguan Lifeng.</p><p>His decision was the same as Aunt Mei's. However, his goal was to cross swords with others, to witness more exquisite sword techniques. He had once been delayed in his cultivation due to his obsession with saber techniques and the Killing Path, almost failing to form his core and nearing the end of his lifespan. After obtaining the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, Shangguan Lifeng became completely engrossed, completely forgetting his previous lessons. He confessed to Qin Sang that he knew he had yet to break through to the mid-Golden Core stage, and his hopes of forming his Nascent Soul in the future were slim. He only wished to focus on the Sword Dao without distractions and achieve something. If one day he could nurture a successor to carry on Senior Qing Zhu's legacy, his life would not be in vain.</p><p>Then came Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Over the years, she had a loving marriage, giving birth to a son and two daughters. She enjoyed the happiness of family life, and witnessed many younger disciples surpassing her in cultivation. Although she was envious, she had no regrets. Nor did she wish to leave her loved ones and travel far to the North Sea. She was willing to live out her days here.</p><p>As for Tan Yi'en, Qin Sang didn't need to talk to him to know that he would definitely go to the North Sea. Tan Yi'en's lifelong ambition had changed from cultivating the greatest sect in the North Star Realm to the greatest sect in the North Sea. He was eager to get started, full of fighting spirit.</p><p>After Tan Yi'en left, Bai Hanqiu would take over the position of chief steward. Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter possessed cultivation talent and was of a similar age to Qin NianSui. She had previously wanted to ask Qin Sang for permission to arrange for the two to become cultivation companions.</p><p>Qin Sang was noncommittal on this matter.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang took out a piece of jade, cut it into two jade pendants, suspended them in his palm, and used Demonic Flames to refine them into protective treasures, handing them to Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Finally, there was Zhao Ying.</p><p>She inherited Qing Jun's lineage, and Qin Sang treated her as one of his own juniors, with equal regard. Zhao Ying decided to stay in the North Star Realm for the time being, assisting Li Yufu, and would go to the North Sea when the time was right.</p><p>"Take a look at these two items. Have you ever seen them before?"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Yang Puppet Crystal and the puppet of the Bizarre General. He had studied them for a long time, but had no clue. It was a pity that Qing Jun was not present. Zhao Ying had been around Qing Jun and might have heard something.</p><p>Zhao Ying took the Yang Puppet Crystal and the puppet with both hands, examining them repeatedly. Her brow furrowed deeper and deeper. She apologized, sat cross-legged on the ground, closed her eyes, and performed a secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't speak, waiting patiently.</p><p>It was a full two hours before Zhao Ying woke up. Pointing to the puppet, she said, "Reporting to the Monastery Master, your disciple has never seen this kind of puppet before. But I have a feeling that it is similar to Senior Qing Jun's Green Luan puppet, in some respects. It is born due to the imprint of its master within. Once the master falls, it will completely fall silent, losing all power. Outsiders cannot control it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded thoughtfully. He suspected that this might be the Bizarre General's life-bound puppet, a very mysterious and exquisite type of puppet mastery.</p><p>After a pause, seeing that Qin Sang did not speak, Zhao Ying continued, "Your disciple seems to have heard Senior Qing Jun mention this kind of puppet crystal once. Senior only mentioned it briefly. It might be a treasure used by ancient cultivators to refine puppets, the method is lost. Your disciple is also unclear about their function. This puppet should not have completely refined the Yin Puppet Crystal. Please forgive your disciple's dullness. I have racked my brains and cannot think of how to separate it intact."</p><p>Qin Sang did not reprimand her, his eyes revealing a look of approval. The puppet crystal could enhance Nascent Soul-level puppets. For Zhao Ying to be able to see so much was already quite impressive.</p><p>...</p><p>In the following time, the Green Ram Monastery seemed calm, but in reality, there were undercurrents as they prepared for the relocation. Qin Sang learned from the Profound Sky Palace's mistakes and made some adjustments to the Green Ram Monastery, but he also understood that it was impossible to solve everything at once. The future of the Green Ram Monastery was in the hands of these disciples.</p><p>Besides the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, he also left three things for the Green Ram Monastery.</p><p>First, the sea chart of the Central Province.</p><p>Second, the formula for Spirit-Suppressing Incense. He established a rule that in the future, only the Monastery Master and Grand Elder of the Green Ram Monastery would be qualified to know these two things. The Green Ram Monastery should pay attention to collecting the spirit medicines listed on the Spirit-Suppressing Incense formula.</p><p>Third, the Art of Sacrifice.</p><p>In the North Sea, the status of this secret technique was equivalent to that of an Immortal Technique. Mastering this technique and refining a pseudo-spirit treasure would allow late-Nascent Soul stage cultivators to further enhance their strength. Once it was spread, the entire Four Realms of the North Sea would be thrown into turmoil.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace also knew the Art of Sacrifice, so this technique was not a secret. Due to multiple considerations, Qin Sang decided to leave it behind, but he set up a divine sense restriction. Only those juniors who reached the Divine Sense Manifestation stage could obtain this secret technique.</p><p>With these three things, the Green Ram Monastery's foundation was no less profound than that of other sects. However, the Green Ram Monastery was still too weak, and it would probably be a long time before they could benefit from it.</p><p>...</p><p>Half a year later.</p><p>Qin Sang personally attended the North Star Alliance Conference for the last time. The news that the Green Ram Monastery had gained a new Nascent Soul Elder had spread like wildfire, reaching all the sects. Upon seeing Qin Sang, everyone came forward to offer their congratulations.</p><p>As for what they were thinking, Qin Sang didn't care. He publicly announced that he would be entering seclusion, vowing to break through to the late-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Three days after the conference ended.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao, along with Mu Yifeng and the first batch of elite disciples selected from the Green Ram Monastery, quietly flew to the southernmost tip of the North Star Realm, where they met up with Jing Yu and the demons of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Since it was the first time, the number of people was small.</p><p>With the help of the Ten Direction Land-Breaking Divine Shuttle, they stopped at two shelters along the way to rest. They safely led these juniors through the storm belt without any major incidents.</p><p>Upon entering a brand-new world, the disciples felt novelty and excitement. But after flying with Qin Sang for a few days, they started to feel bored, as if it wasn't much different from the North Star Realm.</p><p>While bypassing the Demon Territory, Jing Yu inquired about the location of the Emerald Bright Archipelago and entered the Demon Territory alone to travel.</p><p>The others hardly paused, arriving smoothly at the Emerald Bright Archipelago.</p><p>Above Green Ram Island.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared, looking down. After his long absence, the grand array on Green Ram Island was intact. No one dared to set foot on it.</p><p>Seeing such a large sea area being exclusively enjoyed by the Green Ram Monastery, and learning that Qin Sang controlled Nine Precepts Island and other treasure islands, Tan Yi'en and the others were extremely excited, their longing for the future growing even stronger.</p><p>They had once created the Green Ram Monastery from scratch.</p><p>Now, opening a branch monastery was naturally something they were very familiar with. Drawing on previous experience and lessons, they quickly built Green Ram Island into a decent place.</p><p>During this period, they finally learned from others about their Monastery Master's great achievements.</p><p>In just twenty years, he had turned the Boundless Sea upside down, his fame spreading throughout the North Sea. In their hearts, their respect for Qin Sang had reached an unimaginable level.</p><p>At the same time, the news of Qin Sang establishing a sect in the Boundless Sea spread, attracting the attention of various forces.</p><p>The situation in the North Sea was complex, with far more factors to consider than in the North Star Realm. For example, the Boundless Sea was vast, and merchant associations flourished. Unlike in the North Star Realm, many merchant associations were not controlled by sects and were hegemons in their own right.</p><p>The Green Ram Monastery had to learn how to deal with them.</p><p>There were countless details to consider.</p><p>Qin Sang's infamous reputation was still present, so things were very simple. Especially after he publicly killed the Bizarre General a few years ago, his strength was beyond doubt, and all parties were convinced. Those demons and devils who had been eager to make a move also completely disappeared.</p><p>Tan Yi'en represented the Green Ram Monastery, frequently contacting various forces. Regardless of their cultivation level, they all treated him with great courtesy, and he enjoyed it immensely.</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>The Green Ram Monastery was officially established!</p><p>Tong Lingyu emerged from seclusion and personally led the head disciples of each lineage, bringing congratulatory gifts.</p><p>In addition, there were Master Feng and Valley Master Mu from the String Moon Realm, Daoist Yin Quan, and other renowned Nascent Soul cultivators, as well as fellow Daoists Qin Sang had met in the Star Sand Archipelago, all of whom traveled far and wide to congratulate Qin Sang.</p><p>The forces of the Boundless Sea naturally wouldn't be absent. The surviving demon lords didn't dare to come in person. After killing the Bizarre General, Qin Sang had contacted the Profound Sky Palace to search for the remnants, causing them great anxiety. They took the opportunity to send people with congratulatory gifts to express their intentions.</p><p>The grand scale of the event was perhaps no less than the Dao Attainment Ceremony of a Grand Master.</p><p>Prominent figures arrived one after another, any one of them capable of calling the wind and summoning the rain in the North Star Realm. There were so many in the North Sea. The little bit of pride that Tan Yi'en and the others had was completely shattered, and they realized that they still had a long way to go.</p><p>No Demon Kings from the Demon Territory attended.</p><p>Jing Yu, who had been traveling for a long time, hurried back. Qin Sang reminded her that the Nine-Headed Great Sage was likely connected to the Feather King and knew of their relationship. She needed to be wary of him making a move to harm them.</p><p>Jing Yu didn't visit the Nine-Headed Great Sage, but she took a look from afar. This demon was a nine-headed serpent that had attained the Dao. Surprisingly, it had yet to transform into human form, maintaining its demonic body. When it moved, it would swallow clouds and spit mist, a magnificent sight.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't let the Green Ram Monastery monopolize the sea chart precisely to guard against this demon.</p><p>The ceremony ended.</p><p>Shi Xue, Liu Li, and the others remained on Green Ram Island. Liu Li's Heavenly Tribulation was fast approaching.</p>
