<h1>Chapter 2148: Past and Present Lives</h1><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The tribulation clouds radiated a terrifying aura. Golden lightning filled the void, thick and thin, crisscrossing into a net, boundless, like cracks in the void, tearing the River of Sin into thousands of threads.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword floated in mid-air, enveloped by the thunderous might, its body radiating a pure sword light, giving off a sense of tranquility.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly, heeding the summons, with fluttering wings, flew towards the tribulation lightning. Now was the perfect time to devour the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his mind in the altar, silently urging the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, and immediately, amidst the countless golden tribulation lightning bolts, azure lightning appeared, equally magnificent.</p><p>The sword spirit had just undergone the wind tribulation. Qin Sang wanted to delay the tribulation lightning for it, buying it time to adjust.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The first wave of tribulation lightning brewed to completion. Golden thunder, like a torrential downpour, descended with the momentum to destroy everything.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly, instead of fear, felt joy. Qin Sang could sense her excitement. The Celestial Eye Butterfly rapidly vibrated her wings, her body like a stream of light, streaking across the void, rushing towards the first tribulation lightning bolt.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also made his move. Azure lightning condensed into a thunder seal. The seal vibrated, and countless azure lightning bolts appeared out of thin air, like thunder serpents and electric pythons, clearly visible under the golden tribulation clouds, charging towards the first wave of tribulation lightning.</p><p>In the next moment, the azure lightning and the golden tribulation lightning collided. The two types of lightning clashed together, erupting with an earth-shattering thunderous roar, like the wrath of the Heavenly Dao. The power of the thunder became even more violent, apocalyptic!</p><p>Some of the tribulation lightning and azure lightning perished together, while the remaining tribulation lightning was intercepted by the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly danced joyfully amidst the tribulation lightning, her body enveloped in a layer of golden electric light. The Celestial Eye patterns on her wings shone, shooting out beams of lightning.</p><p>Tribulation lightning struck the Celestial Eye Butterfly. Some dispersed into thousands of electric threads, while others merged into the surface layer of electric light, like stones sinking into the sea.</p><p>In this process, the power of the tribulation lightning was being devoured by the Celestial Eye Butterfly. The electric light and threads around her grew increasingly numerous, transforming into a golden thundercloud. Countless electric arcs flickered incessantly, but the Celestial Eye Butterfly was still not satisfied, dragging the thundercloud to continuously capture new tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he withdrew part of the thunder seal's power, diverting the tribulation lightning to the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly was like a greedy child who had received a giant golden cotton candy, exhilarated, devouring it in large mouthfuls.  Fortunately, they were in the River of Sin. If there were other cultivators nearby, they would definitely be shocked by this scene.</p><p>Under the combined interception of Qin Sang and the Celestial Eye Butterfly, only a few stray bolts of the first wave of tribulation lightning struck the Cloud Wanderer Sword before it came to an end.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly, after a satisfying meal, floated directly below the tribulation clouds, digesting the power of the tribulation lightning, anticipating the arrival of new tribulation lightning.</p><p>The tribulation clouds quickly brewed the second wave of tribulation lightning. Qin Sang was about to act when the Cloud Wanderer Sword suddenly emitted a clear sword cry. Its tip tilted slightly upwards, and it slashed out a sword strike in mid-air.</p><p>The sword light was like a startling rainbow, instantly annihilating countless tribulation lightning bolts.</p><p>On the other side, the Celestial Eye Butterfly continued to happily devour the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses for a moment, confirming that the Cloud Wanderer Sword was unharmed, then restrained the power of the thunder seal, urging his true essence, controlling the sword to break through the thunder!</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword had already birthed a sword spirit and possessed independent will, but controlling it was the same as before. No matter what sword technique he used, there was no sense of stagnation. He and the sword spirit, the spirit sword, were as if connected by blood, a seamless whole, cooperating perfectly.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Sword lights, one after another, continuously slashed towards the tribulation clouds. More and more tribulation lightning was annihilated by the sword light. This situation continued until the end of the second wave of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Having successfully weathered two waves of tribulation lightning, the Cloud Wanderer Sword remained unscathed, but Qin Sang dared not relax. The tribulation clouds in the sky grew thicker and heavier, and even more terrifying tribulation lightning was yet to come.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>â€¦</p><p>The heavenly tribulation churned the River of Sin, its power impossible to conceal.</p><p>Qin Sang, focused on helping the Cloud Wanderer Sword overcome the tribulation, couldn't attend to the outside world. He could only have the Vermilion Bird patrol the surroundings, guarding against any ferocious beasts that might be attracted.</p><p>"Why hasn't it ended yet?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird turned its head to look behind it. Through the thick, turbid air, it could barely see the golden light. Even from such a distance, it felt a sense of palpitations.</p><p>It and Qin Sang had previously discussed the power of a spiritual treasure's heavenly tribulation. Now, it seemed to far exceed their estimations.</p><p>At this moment, beneath the tribulation clouds, the Cloud Wanderer Sword shone brilliantly.</p><p>The momentum of the tribulation lightning became increasingly magnificent, bombarding down endlessly. Yet, the small spirit sword was able to confront the tribulation lightning head-on, showing no weakness.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly flew back to Qin Sang's side. She had devoured enough tribulation lightning and needed time to digest the power within her. Only the Cloud Wanderer Sword was left fighting alone in the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was somewhat unusual, his gaze flickering. In such a critical juncture, he slowly closed his eyes, as if he had comprehended something.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>This wave of tribulation lightning finally ended.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword floated in the sky, its tip pointed towards the tribulation clouds, its momentum like a rainbow. Under the tempering of countless tribulation lightning bolts, its sword light became even more condensed.</p><p>The tribulation clouds churned violently, the next wave of tribulation lightning delayed. Golden lightning converged from all directions towards the center of the tribulation clouds, the light dazzlingly bright.</p><p>Experienced cultivators could all see that the tribulation clouds were brewing the last and strongest wave of tribulation lightning!</p><p>'Buzz, buzz, buzz...'</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword seemed to sense the danger, trembling incessantly.</p><p>The power of the thunder within the tribulation clouds accumulated to its peak. The light was as thick as water, illuminating the void.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>The tribulation clouds descended, the lightning abruptly pressing down. The aura of the tribulation lightning exploded, as if a peerless heavenly thunder was about to emerge.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze flashing with brilliant light.  The Cloud Wanderer Sword sensed its master's intent, its azure light blazing, its sword cry shaking the heavens.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword soared into the sky, actually taking the initiative to slash towards the tribulation clouds!</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, a beam of azure light shot skyward. Compared to the vast and heavy tribulation clouds, it appeared so slender and insignificant, yet it burst forth with the sharpest sword intent, its edge fully revealed, advancing without hesitation!</p><p>A glimmer of anticipation flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. This sword strike was no ordinary one. It was a sword strike imbued with the power of the Sword Domain, the strongest sword strike he had ever unleashed in his life!</p><p>After stepping into the Void Refinement stage, he often contemplated the "Purple Star Sword Canon" and the sword light bestowed upon him by Senior Tian Yue.  His understanding of the Sword Domain far surpassed that of cultivators at the same level.</p><p>Ultimately, limited by his cultivation, he understood many things but didn't know the underlying principles. Even if he grasped some concepts, he didn't know how to apply them, how to integrate them into his own sword techniques.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang mostly used the aura of the Sword Domain to intimidate his enemies, somewhat enhancing the power of his sword formations.</p><p>Perhaps he had been inspired, breaking through a certain bottleneck, accumulating knowledge and experience that now burst forth. Or perhaps it was because of the Cloud Wanderer Sword's transformation, Qin Sang receiving assistance from the spirit sword. At this moment, he finally integrated his past comprehensions.</p><p>There was no aura of the Sword Domain pervading the surroundings because Qin Sang was still far from comprehending the Law Domain. What he had grasped was merely superficial. He couldn't unleash a true Sword Domain, but he had integrated the power of the Sword Domain into this single sword strike. In the eyes of a true Body Integration stage cultivator, it was undoubtedly a very crude application, but its power had undergone a qualitative leap.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword light and the lightning met.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword pierced through. The imposing tribulation lightning unexpectedly appeared to stagnate, then shattered into countless fragments of golden light.</p><p>Having cleaved through an unknown number of tribulation lightning bolts, the Cloud Wanderer Sword's momentum was like a bamboo splitting apart, its power still climbing.  Under Qin Sang's surprised gaze, it cleaved through layers of tribulation lightning, its sword light incomparably brilliant, tearing open the body of the tribulation clouds!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The thunderous roars were deafening, yet they sounded somewhat chaotic.</p><p>The tribulation clouds tore apart, violently churning. The lightning within began to dissipate, the might of the tribulation lightning showing signs of decline.</p><p>No matter how brilliant the lightning, it could not compare to the dazzling sword light. One sword overshadowed heaven and earth!</p><p>"It's over..."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with excitement.</p><p>This sword strike was truly exhilarating!</p><p>"What comes next? Will there be a heart demon tribulation?"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He thought to himself, the newly born sword spirit was like a newborn baby, pure and untainted. Even if there were a heart demon tribulation, it could easily pass, right?</p><p>However, the Cloud Wanderer Sword was different from other spiritual treasures. It possessed a sliver of Cloud Wanderer's true nature. If Cloud Wanderer were to be revived, facing a heart demon tribulation that transcended the Void Refinement heavenly tribulation, the outcome would be unpredictable.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart tightened, but he saw that the Cloud Wanderer Sword showed no signs of stopping. It was like a fish returning to the sea, moving freely among the tribulation clouds, cutting the remaining tribulation lightning into pieces.</p><p>Immediately after, Qin Sang sensed a peculiar fluctuation in the sky. The tribulation clouds had not yet dispersed, and golden light appeared within the clouds, seemingly giving birth to something similar to Emperor Flow Nectar, which was devoured by the Cloud Wanderer Sword in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Following this, the consciousness within the sword body became completely stable.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The birth of a sword spirit truly involved the Heavenly Dao's blessings!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword light pierced through the tribulation clouds, shooting out rapidly, coming to an abrupt halt in front of Qin Sang, revealing the true form of the spirit sword.</p><p>Azure light flowed on the surface of the sword, revealing a young boy in azure robes.</p><p>The boy was delicately carved, with clear brows and bright eyes, looking about six or seven years old. However, there was a composure between his eyebrows that didn't match his appearance. He bowed formally to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer greets Great Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression stiffened slightly.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly flew in front of the azure-robed boy, as if scrutinizing him.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown in his sleeve trembled, and Little Five also came out, standing next to Qin Sang, tilting her small head, her eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>Seeing the Celestial Eye Butterfly and Little Five, the azure-robed boy was very polite, saying respectfully, "Cloud Wanderer greets Elder Sister Butterfly, Elder Sister Little Five."</p><p>Little Five grabbed Qin Sang's robe, giggling.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly flapped her wings, flying around the azure-robed boy, her tail feathers scattering beautiful stardust. This was an expression of her joy.</p><p>The corners of Qin Sang's mouth twitched. He opened his mouth and asked, "How much do you remember about the past?"</p><p>The azure-robed boy thought for a moment and said, "After my sentience was born, I understood some things in my heart. It should be that only people and things that have been with Great Master day and night, and only after my spirit has grown to a certain extent, can they leave a deep impression on me."</p><p>"So, you don't remember anything earlier?" Qin Sang's eyes were complex.</p><p>The azure-robed boy bowed and said, "Please enlighten me, Great Master."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then sighed softly. "Your origins are somewhat complicated. It starts with another person. However, we can't stay here for long. Let's leave this place first."</p><p>At this time, the Vermilion Bird sensed that the aura of the heavenly tribulation had dissipated and flew back. Hearing about what had just happened, its eyes lit up. "Little guy, call me Senior!"</p><p>"Senior Vermilion Bird," the azure-robed boy said obediently.</p><p>"Ah! So obedient! Much more likeable than that butterfly," the Vermilion Bird said with a smile.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly blinked the eyes on her wings, rolling her eyes at the Vermilion Bird.  Previously, the Vermilion Bird had always tried to lure her away from Qin Sang, but had never succeeded.</p><p>Fortunately, this tribulation did not attract any ferocious beasts. After the heavenly tribulation dispersed, the River of Sin returned to its original state, with no signs of ferocious beasts nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled swiftly, moving away from the tribulation site.</p><p>Along the way, he told the azure-robed boy everything.</p><p>Including his friendship with Cloud Wanderer, Cloud Wanderer's experiences, his resolute decision not to enter reincarnation, and most importantly, that the sword spirit was born relying on Cloud Wanderer's true spirit.</p><p>He didn't even conceal from the sword spirit his vow to help Cloud Wanderer revive and his hope that Cloud Wanderer could be reborn through this.</p><p>The sword spirit clearly had its own will, equivalent to an independent person.  As time went on, it would have its own life and memories, making it even less likely to identify itself as another person.</p><p>Unless he could keep it from the sword spirit forever, one day, the sword spirit would suddenly learn the truth, overturning the meaning of its existence. Even if their lives were intertwined, connected by blood, it was very likely that a rift would form in their hearts. It was better to tell the sword spirit now.</p><p>It was a terrifying thing for a life-bound spirit sword's sword spirit to become estranged from its master.  It was precisely because of this that the vast majority of cultivators in the world chose to have their life-bound spiritual treasures advance to true treasures, rather than acquired spiritual treasures.</p><p>"This poor Daoist also doesn't know if you truly count as Senior Cloud Wanderer."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He had searched carefully several times, confirming that Cloud Wanderer's true spirit had disappeared, giving birth to the sword spirit. However, Cloud Wanderer's memories had not been restored, and he could not see any trace of Cloud Wanderer in the sword spirit.</p><p>Could this be considered a successful rebirth?</p><p>If Cloud Wanderer had known back then that this would be the result, that he wouldn't be able to find himself after reviving, would he have accepted it?  Would he still have resolutely chosen not to enter reincarnation?</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat lost.</p><p>The azure-robed boy addressed him as Great Master. Should he treat him as Senior Cloud Wanderer or Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer?</p><p>Cloud Wanderer's true spirit had completely disappeared, transforming into Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer. Qin Sang didn't know what else he could do, whether there was still a chance to help Cloud Wanderer return to his true self.</p><p>The azure-robed boy was unexpectedly calm. He lowered his head and pondered for a while, then said seriously,</p><p>"Great Master just mentioned the concept of reincarnation in the world.</p><p>"My past life was Cloud Wanderer, Great Master's close friend.  My present life is Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>"If I can return to my true self, we are originally one. Cloud Wanderer is willing to cooperate with Great Master in any attempt to find my past life.</p><p>"Before that, I am Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer.</p><p>"Without Great Master, there would be no Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer. Your kindness is like that of my parents, as heaven and earth can testify!  It is only right and proper that I, along with Elder Sister Little Five and the others, address you as Great Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at the azure-robed boy.  The sword spirit was even more carefree than he had imagined.</p><p>The azure-robed boy was the sword spirit of his life-bound spirit sword. Qin Sang could naturally sense that these words came from the heart, without any pretense.</p><p>The sword spirit's lack of resistance towards Cloud Wanderer was already the best outcome.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang seemed to have made a decision. He nodded and said, "Alright! From now on, you are Sword Spirit Cloud Wanderer!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Event has started!</p><p>From September 1st to October 15th, "Asking the Immortal Path" is holding a fan fiction incentive event.
