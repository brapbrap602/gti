<h1>Chapter 1237: The Spirit-Stabilizing Jade Talisman</h1><p>When crafting the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, the use of demonic soul-refining techniques was employed, making it inherently a malevolent puppet. Even genuine Nascent Soul cultivators, unless they had reached the realm of spiritual manifestation, would suffer damage to their souls when controlling the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, as the puppet's essence would gnaw at their spiritual core.</p><p>Initially, this damage was bearable. After a period of quiet cultivation, the puppet's master could gradually recover. Compared to possessing a Nascent Soul-level combatant, this price was negligible. Moreover, the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace discovered an astonishing function of the puppet. Due to the limited records left by their ancestors, later generations were unsure whether it was due to the materials used, some secret technique employed during the puppet's creation, or a combination of these factors that led to an unknown transformation.</p><p>Every soul bitten by the puppet would leave a soul shadow within it, forever bound to the puppet. Golden Core disciples of the sect, by sensing these Nascent Soul soul shadows, could experience a trace of the Nascent Soul realm's profound changes while still at the Golden Core stage. The benefits were obviousâ€”it significantly increased the chances of breaking through bottlenecks. However, obtaining this experience was no easy feat. The puppet dared to devour even the souls of Nascent Soul cultivators, let alone Golden Core disciples. A single misstep could result in not only failing to gain any benefits but also having one's entire soul devoured by the puppet, condemning them to eternal suffering without reincarnation.</p><p>It wasn't until the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace obtained the method to craft the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman that the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's true potential was unleashed. At that time, the sect flourished, enjoying unparalleled prestige. The Earth-Crippled Elder's plot against Daoist Xuanyu, aiming to seize the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman, stemmed from rumors that the talisman could aid in forming a Nascent Soul. In truth, he was mistaken. What truly aided in forming a Nascent Soul was the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, while the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman merely served as a supplement. However, the talisman did offer some assistance in overcoming the Heart Demon Tribulation, so his assumption wasn't entirely wrong.</p><p>The true function of the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman was to create an inner landscape space within the Purple Mansion, where the soul could hide, providing a degree of protection. Crafting this talisman required a cultivator to begin refining it immediately after forming their Foundation Establishment, expending immense effort over many years without interruption, continuously nourishing it with spiritual energy until reaching the peak of the Golden Core stage. Thus, this talisman could only be used by its master. Upon the master's death, the talisman would be destroyed, making it impossible for outsiders to seize it. Even if the Earth-Crippled Elder hadn't been thwarted by Qin Sang, he would never have obtained the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman.</p><p>Disciples of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace refined the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman, and by the time the talisman reached completion, their cultivation would have reached the peak of the Golden Core stage, just as they were about to face the Nascent Soul formation barrier. This allowed them to enter the puppet's inner landscape under the talisman's protection. Although refining the talisman was extremely difficult, the allure of forming a Nascent Soul was so great that nearly every disciple of the sect possessed one at that time.</p><p>However, as time passed, circumstances changed. Due to a sudden calamity, all the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace perished, and the sect's fortunes took a drastic turn for the worse. Facing imminent destruction, a peak Golden Core disciple was entrusted with the task of controlling the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet to repel the invading enemies. The battle was brutal. Although the disciple succeeded in driving back the enemies, he was horrified to discover that a significant portion of his soul had been devoured by the puppet, rendering recovery impossible. With an incomplete soul, even if he survived, he would forever lose the chance to form a Nascent Soul. If reincarnation existed, his future lives might also be affected.</p><p>Later, a new Nascent Soul ancestor emerged within the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace, and the sect's situation improved. However, as the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet devoured more and more souls, the cost of controlling it grew increasingly severe. Eventually, even the Nascent Soul ancestors found it unbearable. The sect once boasted a late-stage Nascent Soul grand cultivator, whose spiritual manifestation was unparalleled in the Northern Star Realm. He attempted to refine the soul shadows within the puppet to eliminate this hidden danger. However, he discovered that the puppet's body was now bound with countless soul shadows, a chaotic mass of ten thousand ghosts devouring souls. Even he, though capable of barely controlling the puppet, would suffer backlash and injury if he tried to refine the chaotic soul shadows. It was an impossible task.</p><p>By now, the puppet's interior had become even more chaotic. The danger of experiencing the Nascent Soul soul shadows had grown too great. Contemporary disciples of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace, even those who had successfully refined the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman, no longer dared to attempt it. The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was sealed away, used only to deter external threats and awakened only when the sect faced dire peril. Otherwise, how could the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace have gone so long without producing a single Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>As for the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman, although its effects were extraordinary, its allure had diminished. The lengthy refinement process consumed too much cultivation time, and only the most talented disciples chose to focus on mastering this secret talisman. The successive sect leaders of the Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace selected their direct disciples from a young age, nurturing them to be benevolent and always ready to sacrifice themselves for the sect.</p><p>The previous sect leader, Iron-Crowned Daoist, was forced to use the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet once. In a desperate gamble, he treated the Purple Micro Palace as his last hope and perished there. Gongliang Yu, who had brought out the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet this time to help him search for the Blood Ganoderma, had no intention of giving up his chance to form a Nascent Soul. His reliance was on the Spirit-Stabilizing Jade Talisman.</p><p>The Spirit-Stabilizing Jade Talisman was an ancient treasure Gongliang Yu had stumbled upon. Its function was similar to the Inner Landscape Primordial Talisman but far more powerful. Unfortunately, it could only be used once. With this treasure, he believed he could safely navigate the Heart Demon Tribulation of forming a Nascent Soul. However, he hadn't even reached the stage of condensing a Nascent Soul, let alone facing the Heart Demon Tribulation. Gongliang Yu was willing to expend the Spirit-Stabilizing Jade Talisman to obtain the Blood Ganoderma, but he was deeply apprehensive, unsure if the talisman could fully protect him from the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's soul-devouring capabilities. After all, even Nascent Soul ancestors had suffered soul damage while controlling the puppet.</p><p>"What a treasure! What a treasure!" Gongliang Yu exclaimed repeatedly, his face filled with joy. He was praising the Spirit-Stabilizing Jade Talisman. The wisp of azure spiritual light sealed within the talisman, of unknown origin, firmly protected his soul. No matter how fiercely the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet gnawed at it, his soul remained unharmed. Frustrated, the puppet's eyes grew increasingly frenzied.</p><p>Realizing time was of the essence, Gongliang Yu knew he had to find the Blood Ganoderma before the azure spiritual light dissipated. Without hesitation, he formed a hand seal and pointed toward the Blood River, commanding, "Go!"</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet's sinister grin widened, its expression somewhat reluctant, but it ultimately obeyed Gongliang Yu's command, plunging into the Blood River.</p><p>"Phew..." Gongliang Yu exhaled deeply, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. The puppet's crazed gaze had sent chills down his spine. This puppet was capable of battling mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, two whole realms above him. The fact that it hadn't devoured him and was still under his control was nothing short of a miracle. If not for his trust in the sect's secret techniques, Gongliang Yu would never have dared to attempt this.</p><p>The Blood River was not filled with liquid blood but an extremely dense blood mist. </p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet surged into the Blood River, leading the way as Gongliang Yu hurriedly followed.</p>
