<h1>Chapter 784: Valley of Mystery</h1><p>Chapter 784: Valley of Mystery</p><p>Qin Sang leaped between the fragments of mountain peaks.  His destination was the valley. As he passed by a hidden place, he sometimes used his sword energy to probe, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. The seventh level’s space seemed endless, with mountain peak fragments everywhere. Qin Sang flew with all his might, traversing countless fragments, before finally reaching the valley.</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly stopped, his escape light shifting, and he landed in a nearby forest, concealing his aura, and frowning at the valley.  A moment ago, figures had flashed past the valley entrance, seemingly more than one.  No wonder he hadn't seen a single person along the way. Could it be that the cultivators who had previously entered the Celestial Tower were all gathered in the valley?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, suspecting that the battle between the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman began in the valley. After they left, these cultivators had gathered to scavenge for any remaining treasures. The Great Shaman had found something in the valley, something unprecedented.  The valley might contain a teleportation array leading to a higher level, related to the ancient cultivators' relics within the Celestial Tower. The Demon Lord’s relentless pursuit suggests it's more than just a conflict between the two races.  Did the Witch Clan find an ancient text revealing the secrets of the Seven Killing Hall?</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang confirmed that there were no Nascent Soul masters in the valley and could no longer restrain himself. He transformed into a streak of light, flew out of the forest, and headed straight for the valley.</p><p>The valley was vast, the largest fragment Qin Sang had seen so far, containing a complete valley within the mountain peak fragments.  Landing at the valley entrance, his eyes fell upon the lush greenery on both sides, vibrant and alive.  The river in the middle of the valley had dried up, yet the surrounding forests were still remarkably dense. However, there was no wind, the leaves were motionless, and the entire forest gave off an eerie, deathly still feeling, directly contradicting the vibrant green. This feeling was similar to the lower levels.</p><p>Cultivators were busily searching for something within the valley. They noticed Qin Sang's arrival, only glancing up before ignoring him. However, their expressions suggested they hadn't found anything useful yet. The fallen ancient trees and ubiquitous signs of chaos clearly indicated a fierce battle had taken place here. His guess was correct; the Nascent Soul masters of both clans had fought here. However, finding any clues amidst the destruction was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, surveying his surroundings before finally focusing on the valley's interior. It was enveloped by a mass of black light, like a black hole. Upon closer inspection, the black light was composed of countless black threads, interwoven and chaotic, completely obscuring the valley's interior.  Numerous restrictions covered the side walls, weathered and eroded, from which the black threads emanated.  These black threads, thin as琴弦 (qin xian - literally "qin strings"), were not tangible objects; they hung suspended, motionless. Their sheer number gave the impression of a single mass of black light.</p><p>Despite their seemingly ethereal nature, these threads were extremely dangerous. None of the cultivators searching the valley dared to approach them.  It was said that several Nascent Soul masters had perished there, leaving no trace behind. For years, no one had successfully penetrated the barrier.  The surrounding walls were also riddled with haphazard sword and knife marks, but most were old, suggesting even the Great Shaman and the Demon Lord had hesitated to disturb the threads.</p><p>"What treasure did the Great Shaman obtain? How can I verify it under the watchful eyes of so many?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, shook his head helplessly, and dashed into the valley. He traversed the valley floor, his divine sense fully deployed, searching without restraint, just like the others. Strangely, besides the battle’s traces, they found nothing.  The treasure wouldn't be openly displayed; otherwise, it would have been taken long ago.  If the Great Shaman obtained a treasure, they must have opened some hidden place.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang overheard the other cultivators talking.</p><p>“Do you think there’s no secret realm or ancient palace? Maybe the Great Shaman ventured into the valley's depths and retrieved the treasure from within?”</p><p>A cultivator, having searched in vain, stood up, staring into the valley's depths, voicing his doubts.  The others turned their gaze towards the same spot.</p><p>The black threads hung silently, seemingly absorbing even light, inspiring fear.</p><p>"Wasn't it said that a higher-level teleportation array was hidden here?  Could our earlier guesses have been wrong?  Perhaps this isn't a teleportation array, but a treasure vault?  But the Seven Killing Hall has been opened many times, and no one has ever gotten inside.  Our human ancestors, many exceptionally talented and powerful, even those comparable to the Great Shaman, were all helpless. Could the Great Shaman be so powerful that they can withstand the power of the black threads?" someone questioned doubtfully.</p><p>Another person said, "Isn't it widely rumored that the Witch Clan provoked a war, recklessly launching an attack, all for the Seven Killing Hall? They must have discovered something to risk everything. Besides, the Witch Clan possesses many strange and ancient witchcrafts and techniques.  Some things are beyond our understanding. It's not surprising they might have a way to counter the black threads. But if there are indeed ancient human artifacts hidden here, and the Witch Clan got there first, I wonder if our ancestors would accept it."</p><p>"The waves are rising again in the Canglang Sea!"</p><p>The person sighed softly.</p><p>As they spoke, some cultivators flew over, standing sparsely before the black threads, their eyes filled with fear, not daring to cross the line.</p><p>No one could discern any mystery within.</p><p>Some, unwilling to give up, continued searching, while others silently retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang, his gaze sharp, searched while listening to their discussions.</p><p>He summoned his ebony sword, pretending to clear away debris on the ground, but secretly activating his sword energy to probe everywhere.</p><p>The Day Mountain cliff of Ziwei Palace looked no different from other places externally, but it hid a sword path and a teleportation array, accessible only by the unique sword energy of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen".</p><p>He could only place his hope on this.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang, like the others, found nothing.</p><p>He reached the depths of the valley and felt the situation becoming difficult.</p><p>"Do I have to test every fragment of the mountain peaks? It's impossible to complete that in such a short time,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed helplessly, looking at the intersecting threads before him.</p><p>With his cultivation, entering would be a one-way trip.</p><p>These threads themselves seemed unrelated to sword energy; his ebony sword and killing talismans remained inert.</p><p>Unwilling to leave empty-handed, Qin Sang shifted his gaze, examining the two mountain walls.</p><p>The walls were covered with scars, some sword marks possibly left by ancient cultivators countless years ago, weathering the passage of time to be revealed now.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, fixing on a sword mark.</p><p>This mark was at the edge of the black threads' range, hidden and tiny, almost imperceptible!</p>
