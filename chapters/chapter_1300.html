Chapter 1292: An Old Acquaintance

Memories of the past resurfaced, causing Qin Sang's figure to pause ever so slightly.  
Cang Qing and Jing Yu, following closely behind, also came to a halt.  
Following Qin Sang's gaze, Cang Qing noticed a Golden Core cultivator from the Frost Domain fiercely engaged in battle, wielding a treasured blade. His expression shifted slightly.  

"Do you recognize him, Fellow Daoist?"  
Qin Sang turned his head, keenly noticing the change in Cang Qing's demeanor.  

"Fellow Daoist Qin, do you have some connection with this young man?"  
Cang Qing was surprised. "I do have some impression of him. His blade techniques are quite impressive, and he has gained some renown among the rogue cultivators. Fellow Daoist Huangfu from the Shadow Slaughter Sect saw potential in him and wanted to recruit him into the sect. However, this young man was rather ungrateful, bluntly stating that the Shadow Slaughter Sect's teachings were fundamentally incompatible with his own path. Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Huangfu, valuing talent, did not press the matter."  

Qin Sang's thoughts shifted, recalling the Huangfu that Cang Qing mentioned—the current sect master of the Shadow Slaughter Sect and one of the most likely Golden Core cultivators of this generation to break through to the Nascent Soul stage. It was said that even Gong Liangyu's cultivation was inferior to his.  

The Shadow Slaughter Sect walked the line between righteousness and evil, claiming to be a heterodox sect. At its peak, it had gathered a force comparable to both the righteous and demonic factions, forming a tripartite balance of power.  

After a period of decline, the sect had recently shown signs of resurgence. The current sect master was known to be close to the demonic path. The cultivators of the Shadow Slaughter Sect were all blade practitioners, with two major legacies: the *Shadow Slaughter Blade* and the *Cicada Wing Blade Technique*.  

"He's still a rogue cultivator?"  
Qin Sang glanced downward, pondering for a moment before saying, "You two go ahead. I'll catch up shortly."  

...  

On the battlefield, both sides were locked in a frenzied battle.  

*Bang!*  

With a single slash, Shangguan Lifeng deflected a fiery red spear thrust at him. He took a few heavy breaths, his gaze sweeping the surroundings, and his heart sank.  

The forces of the Sin Abyss should not have appeared here, yet they had descended like divine soldiers.  

The allied forces of the two domains had not anticipated that the Sin Abyss, which had seemed on the verge of collapse, would dare to infiltrate and set an ambush here. Caught off guard, they had stumbled into the enemy's trap, and their formation had been thrown into disarray. Now, they could only fight individually.  

Although their overall strength surpassed that of the Sin Abyss, the current situation was highly unfavorable to them.  

In the distance, dark clouds gathered in the sky, thunder and fire raining down with terrifying force.  

That was the battlefield of the Nascent Soul cultivators.  

The Nascent Soul ancestors of both sides were locked in fierce combat, their figures unseen. It was impossible to tell when the battle would be decided.  

"The Sin Abyss has been lying in wait, having prepared in advance. It's likely that our Nascent Soul ancestors won't be able to achieve victory anytime soon. If this continues, our defeat is inevitable. The best course of action is to find a way to retreat..."  

Just as this thought crossed Shangguan Lifeng's mind, he felt a sharp pain between his eyebrows. His opponent's fiery red spear thrust toward him once more.  

He quickly dismissed his distracting thoughts, forming a blade seal. The treasured blade in his hand emitted a low hum, and a surge of terrifying bloodlust erupted from it!  

His opponent, a red-robed youth, was struck by the overwhelming bloodlust, his mind shaken and a faint sense of fear creeping in. Alarmed, he hurriedly steadied his mind.  

*Swish!*  

The treasured blade once again deflected the fiery red spear.  

At the same time, faint ripples appeared in the void behind Shangguan Lifeng. A slender, translucent sword, no thicker than a finger, silently materialized and then shot toward him with deadly precision.  

Someone had taken advantage of their fierce battle to launch a sneak attack.  

In this critical moment, Shangguan Lifeng's expression remained unperturbed. Ignoring the hidden sword, he suddenly lunged toward his treasured blade, gripping its hilt tightly and charging straight at his opponent.  

Man and blade became one!  

In that instant, Shangguan Lifeng and his treasured blade seemed to vanish, replaced by a crimson blade light dozens of feet long. It moved like lightning, appearing above the red-robed youth's head in the blink of an eye and slashing down!  

The cultivators engaged in battle nearby sensed the fluctuations and turned their gazes in surprise.  

"Save me!"  

The red-robed youth's face turned ashen as he screamed in terror.  

The cultivator controlling the hidden sword cursed under his breath, calling Shangguan Lifeng a mad dog. By completely disregarding the hidden sword, Shangguan Lifeng had adopted a suicidal tactic. Even if he managed to kill Shangguan Lifeng, the red-robed youth would still perish under the blade.  

Unable to watch his companion die before his eyes, the hidden attacker had no choice but to reveal himself and intervene.  

*Bang!*  

The crimson blade light was blocked.  

The red-robed youth, having narrowly escaped death, was both frightened and furious. With a roar, he joined forces with his companion to surround Shangguan Lifeng. Shangguan Lifeng, however, no longer maintained his previous relentless momentum. Instead, he fought while retreating, though facing two opponents alone, he was clearly struggling.  

At that moment, none of the three noticed a sword shadow materializing out of thin air beside them.  

Then, they suddenly realized that the space around them had inexplicably darkened. Their opponents had vanished, and it felt as though they had been dragged into an unknown realm.  

The strange scene sent a chill down Shangguan Lifeng's spine. He quickly retracted his blade to defend himself, but strangely, he sensed no immediate threat.  

Suddenly, two agonized screams rang out, and the darkness receded like a tide, restoring their vision.  

To his horror, Shangguan Lifeng discovered that both of his opponents were now dead. Their bodies and treasures were completely unharmed, with no visible wounds, yet they had no breath left in them—lifeless corpses.  

This ghostly method of killing left Shangguan Lifeng gasping in shock.  

The two dead men's eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the sky, sending a shiver down Shangguan Lifeng's spine.  

*Whoosh!*  

The Ebony Sword transformed into a streak of light and flew back.  

Shangguan Lifeng hesitated for a moment before following the sword's trajectory. He saw the sword fly toward a figure and merge into their body.  

"This junior, Shangguan Lifeng, thanks the senior for saving my life!"  

Shangguan Lifeng hurried forward, bowing deeply and not daring to look up.  

A soft sigh reached his ears.  

"Fellow Daoist Shangguan, do you not remember an old acquaintance?"  

Shangguan Lifeng, who had been speculating why this Nascent Soul cultivator had gone out of their way to save him, was stunned. He looked up, his expression filled with doubt and disbelief. "Senior, you are..."  

"This humble Daoist is Qingfeng. It's been a long time, Fellow Daoist. How have you been?" Qin Sang smiled warmly.  

This person was none other than a fellow Daoist Qin Sang had met two hundred years ago while searching for medicinal herbs with Yun Youzi. They had fought side by side back then.  

This was their first reunion since parting ways.  

Qin Sang still remembered Yun Youzi's high praise for Shangguan Lifeng. Yun Youzi had an uncanny ability to judge people, and indeed, Shangguan Lifeng had become a Golden Core cultivator. Though only at the early stage, it was no small feat for a rogue cultivator.  

What was even more remarkable was that Shangguan Lifeng's blade techniques carried a hint of the *Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture's* killing intent.  

Before they parted ways, Shangguan Lifeng had been willing to give up a thousand-year spirit herb just to witness Qin Sang's sword techniques. It seemed he had truly gained something from that experience, as his current skills were quite impressive.  

"Daoist Qingfeng!"  

Shangguan Lifeng exclaimed in disbelief, his face a mixture of shock and awe.  

The sword techniques Qin Sang had demonstrated for him back then had profoundly influenced his path. How could he ever forget?  

Two hundred years ago, they had both been at the Foundation Establishment stage.  

Shangguan Lifeng had devoted his life to cultivation, tirelessly seeking the Dao. It wasn't until he was over two hundred years old that he finally grasped a sliver of opportunity and arduously formed his Golden Core. With his exceptional blade techniques, he had earned a place among his peers and made a name for himself.  

And now, upon reuniting, his old acquaintance had already ascended to the Nascent Soul stage!  

A Nascent Soul ancestor under three hundred years of age!
