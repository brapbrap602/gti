<h1>Chapter 512:  News at Last</h1><p>Chapter 512:  News at Last</p><p>Recently, Qin Sang repeatedly offered the reanimated corpses he'd sold in exchange for this type of medicinal herb.  Anyone perceptive would guess that the corpse-master might be suffering backlash, hence the desperation and willingness to spend everything for the medicine.</p><p>Backlash from reanimated corpses is common among necromancer cultivators; it’s perfectly plausible.</p><p>Because of this, no one would suspect Qin Sang's true intentions.</p><p>A single Firethorn Grass is certainly not worth a Corpse Soldier made from a late-stage Foundation Establishment corpse, but transactions in the cultivation world are based on mutual needs, rarely involving equal exchange.</p><p>Wen Yanjie clearly intended to take advantage of the situation. He held the Firethorn Grass aloft, looking confident and smiling at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already decided to sell. Even without the Firethorn Grass, Wen Yanjie was a suitable target.</p><p>He suppressed his feigned anger, standing still with clenched fists, head slightly bowed. His heart was clearly set on the deal, but he was hesitant to part with his treasure.</p><p>Wen Yanjie smiled slightly, persuading gently, “Daoist friend, to raise so many reanimated corpses, you're no ordinary cultivator.  A Corpse Soldier is merely an external object. Compared to your own path, which is more important, you must know yourself.  As the saying goes, ‘A thousand gold coins scattered can be regained.’ As long as you resolve the backlash, you can cultivate any type of Corpse Soldier.  This Firethorn Grass is not easily obtained, especially in your current state...”</p><p>“Humph! Easier said than done! Do you think Corpse Soldiers are so easy to cultivate? Do you know how much effort I’ve poured into this? If I hadn't been careless…”</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, glanced at Wen Yanjie, summoned the Corpse Soldier made from Luo Xiao's body, and said coldly,  “You’re lucky, you hit my weak point! Give me the Firethorn Grass, and this Corpse Soldier is yours!”</p><p>Wen Yanjie examined the Corpse Soldier, carefully sensing its power with his spiritual sense. Seeing that it was indeed stronger than the previous one, his eyes lit up.</p><p>His skill in necromancy is far inferior to Manager Bao's; he couldn’t easily detect the flaw in the Corpse Soldier's dantian.</p><p>Of course, unless facing a veteran cultivator with extensive combat experience, this flaw is almost insignificant.</p><p>Even someone as strong as Wen Yanjie had to admit that this Corpse Soldier would be a powerful aid in battle.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang reached for the Firethorn Grass, Wen Yanjie suddenly retracted his arm, his tone playful. “Daoist friend, have you misunderstood? I said I would exchange for your Corpse Soldier, but I didn't say just this one. Your previous one was quite strong; I'll reluctantly take both…”</p><p>“Wen, you’re trying to take advantage!”</p><p>Qin Sang exploded with rage.</p><p>He had underestimated Wen Yanjie. The man was insatiable. Exchanging a Firethorn Grass for one Corpse Soldier was already a huge gain, yet he still wasn't satisfied!</p><p>If he agreed to his unreasonable demands, the man would surely become even more demanding. If the situation spiraled out of control, it would affect his plans, something Qin Sang couldn’t allow.</p><p>“Even if I die from the poison today, you won’t get away with it!”</p><p>Qin Sang decided against selling, immediately withdrawing the Corpse Soldier. He stormed towards the door, furious.</p><p>If Wen Yanjie dared to stop him, it would be a fight to the death.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s sincerity, Wen Yanjie’s expression changed slightly. His eyes flickered, then he suddenly smiled, his tone softening. “I was just joking, Daoist friend.  Why get so worked up… Let’s do as you said, the Firethorn Grass for that Corpse Soldier.”</p><p>To show his sincerity, Wen Yanjie tossed the Firethorn Grass to Qin Sang first.</p><p>“I don’t think you were joking, Wen…”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, his tone harsh. He held the Firethorn Grass, examining it carefully before summoning the Corpse Soldier again, erasing the soul imprint, and instructing Wen Yanjie on how to control it. Then, without looking back, he left.</p><p>[Reader Benefits] Read to earn cash or points!  Plus, there’s an iPhone 12 and Switch to be won!

A smile played on his lips; he was clearly very satisfied with the Corpse Soldier.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps approached. The door burst open, and three people entered.</p><p>“Senior Brother Wen, that guy has disappeared.”</p><p>The three stood before Wen Yanjie, their voices urgent.</p><p>Wen Yanjie frowned slightly. "Where did you lose him?"</p><p>One of his men said shamefacedly, "We three lost track of him in the market.  We had men guarding the exits, but no one suspicious passed through."</p><p>Wen Yanjie glared at him fiercely. "You lost him in our own market? A bunch of good-for-nothings!"</p><p>The three men looked embarrassed.  The man on the left mumbled, "We spread out and were very cautious. It's impossible we were spotted.  He seemed to know the market better than we did, dodging around, then suddenly disappearing. I suspect someone was covering his escape. Those large trading houses are all suspicious. Without the Master's orders, we can't search inside…"</p><p>Wen Yanjie listened carefully, then snorted. "So he's very cautious, having already scouted the place and planned his escape.  A pity. I had already probed him; he only had one煞尸 of this level, and he was suffering from backlash and corpse poison. He was at his weakest…  Forget it, let's wrap this up. Let him live."</p><p>…</p><p>In an unnoticed corner of the Qingyang Market.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared silently, coldly watching the men who had been following him leave.</p><p>Having seen through Wen Yanjie's true nature, he had been cautious after leaving the Treasure Pavilion, and indeed found he was being followed.</p><p>Their methods were very skillful; if he hadn't been careful, he would have been hard-pressed to notice.</p><p>Qin Sang was no saint.  At other times, if Wen Yanjie dared to target him, he would have taught him a lesson he'd never forget.</p><p>But now, the bigger picture was important, so Qin Sang decided to endure.</p><p>…</p><p>He found another opportunity and sold the Foundation Establishment mid-stage煞尸 to a Qingyang Demon Sect cultivator. Qin Sang's initial goal had been achieved, and now it was a matter of waiting and seeing.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang worked at the shop as a refiner. He didn't display any exceptionally high refining skills, and mostly interacted with low-level Qi Refinement cultivators. These people were the easiest to extract information from, and he wouldn't attract unwanted attention.</p><p>He was, of course, keeping an eye on those who had purchased his煞尸.</p><p>More than ten days passed.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang deliberately befriended Qingyang Demon Sect disciples and gleaned two pieces of information.</p><p>First, Wen Yanjie and the other disciples who had bought the煞尸 were all going about their business as usual, bringing their煞尸 in and out of the sect normally. The Qingyang Demon Sect didn't seem to care about its disciples controlling煞尸, and their elders didn't interfere.</p><p>Second, a few days ago, they had received warnings from their elders to avoid leaving the sect unless necessary.</p>
