Chapter 1850: The Demon King


Amidst the waves of light, white Qi drifted like wisps of smoke.  After a brief pursuit, it coiled and then dispersed, revealing the figure of Dingxianghou.

His long beard swayed beneath his chin. Dingxianghou gazed ahead, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Within his sight remained only distorted light and fluctuating azure radiance. The enemy had vanished without a trace.

Dingxianghou wasn't particularly skilled in the art of flight, but his cultivation was profound.  Since making his presence known in the Ghost Fang Kingdom, this was the first time he'd been eluded by an opponent.

The enemy's strength remained unknown, demanding caution. Though he hadn't held back entirely, the enemy's escape was a testament to their exceptional遁术 (escape technique).

He'd intended to trail his opponent, awaiting Lingyouwang's arrival. But in a moment of carelessness, he'd lost the enemy's trail.

‘Swish, swish, swish…’

His long beard danced, each white hair suddenly separating and shooting outwards like needles, weaving a vast white net that spread in all directions, seeking to capture any lingering traces of the enemy's Qi.

Unfortunately, the tremors hadn't fully subsided.  The impact of the waves of light had almost completely erased the enemy's Qi.

Just then, a vast shadow emerged behind Dingxianghou, spreading at an alarming rate.

Within the shadow, a figure, standing atop a black cloth, drifted towards him, appearing beside Dingxianghou with seemingly effortless grace.

“Your Highness,” Dingxianghou, already aware of the newcomer's identity, turned and bowed.

“You lost him?”

Lingyouwang asked indifferently.

Shame tinged Dingxianghou’s face. “This person possesses formidable cultivation, and his escape technique is especially refined. I was no match for him.”

“Oh?” Lingyouwang's expression grew more serious. “Could it be one of the Grand True Masters?”

Dingxianghou hesitated. “This person is peculiar. He doesn't seem human.  I suspect he's a demonic soldier under the command of a Grand True Master…”

Lingyouwang’s dark eyes swept over the white Qi net, spreading his powerful divine sense. Unfortunately, the surroundings were too chaotic, greatly hindering his spiritual perception.

After hearing Dingxianghou's account, Lingyouwang frowned.  “Do you believe that the escape speed he displayed was his limit?”

Dingxianghou paused, instantly grasping the implication of Lingyouwang's words. His expression shifted dramatically, and he cried out,

“Not good! It's a diversionary tactic!”

If the opponent truly had more to give, it was highly likely they were trying to lure him and Lingyouwang away.

The other Demon Lords were in danger!

The tremors were so violent that even Lingyouwang couldn't attend to everything. In such a place, it was nearly impossible to lay traps in advance.  Dingxianghou's first reaction upon encountering Qin Sang had been that of an unexpected enemy.  He hadn't considered this possibility, a grave oversight.

Before his voice faded, the white hairs of his beard zipped back.  The black cloth beneath Lingyouwang's feet expanded several times, enveloping Dingxianghou and shooting back at tremendous speed.

At this moment, just as the two demons had anticipated, Qin Sang, seeing Dingxianghou abandon the pursuit, immediately changed direction, arcing around with the intention of returning to the original location. Perhaps there was still a chance.

He urged his Dharma Idol's phoenix wings.

Furthermore, the Cloud Wanderer Sword revolved around him, its light merging with the radiance of lightning.

Lightning Escape, Sword Escape – Qin Sang pushed his escape techniques to the absolute limit he could currently muster, piercing through light and waves, swift as lightning and thunder!

Any Nascent Soul cultivator witnessing this scene would be filled with awe.

Having been exposed, Qin Sang instantly decided to change his strategy, baring his fangs!

These demons had arrived earlier than him and might have already uncovered some secrets. Capturing and killing one would reveal the truth, preventing the enemy from gaining the upper hand.

Qin Sang wasn't confident in facing Dingxianghou, but not all Demon Lords possessed Dingxianghou's strength.

Even if he couldn't find an opportunity to strike, Qin Sang could rely on his escape techniques to retreat unscathed, truly fearless!

‘Rumble… rumble…’

The bottom of the azure sea of light roared incessantly, deafeningly loud.

At this very moment, two figures continuously dodged within the waves of light.  The two men, one tall and one short, both clad in long robes, were Demon Lords who had entered this place with Lingyouwang. One held the title of Pinghou, the other Guihou.

Each Demon Lord bore a black cloth mark on their palm, left by Lingyouwang. It allowed them to sense each other within a certain range, enabling them to quickly regroup after scattering.

They had been separated when the tremors struck, fortunately not too far apart.  Thus, they were the first to reunite and were now following the mark's guidance, seeking to rendezvous with the nearest Demon Lord.

Although the tremors were weakening, the two Demon Lords still had to constantly dodge, unable to navigate the waves of light with the same ease as Qin Sang, Dingxianghou, and Lingyouwang.

Pinghou, with his mid-stage Soul Formation cultivation, fared slightly better but had to look after the weaker Guihou.

“What’s that sound?”

Pinghou seemed to sense something, suddenly stopping and looking up into the distance, a flicker of unease in his eyes.

Guihou followed his gaze, activating his demonic eyes. Within his vision was only chaos.  His pointed ears twitched, and his face instantly changed.

“Careful! There’s…”

Before he could finish, they sensed a powerful aura rushing towards them with astonishing speed.

Next, they saw a flash of lightning, brighter than celestial lightning, sharper than sword light.

The pupils of the two Demon Lords abruptly contracted, their eyes stinging intensely as if pierced by real swords.

‘Boom!’

The newcomer was hostile!

In an instant, the lightning pierced through layers of waves of light, swift as a thunderbolt.

The two Demon Lords were profoundly shaken, their faces etched with fear.

The seabed continued to tremble. They had prepared themselves, yet they still felt caught off guard, a strange sensation of vulnerability washing over them.

It felt as if, under this lightning, no magical power or treasure could protect their lives!

They didn't flee. The enemy's escape speed was so astonishing that running would only hasten their deaths.

A desperate gamble was their only chance of survival!

“Roar!”

Enraged, Pinghou roared, his body contorting. Two sharp horns sprouted from his forehead, his body rapidly expanding, his limbs bulging with muscle, his bones twisting.

‘Rip!’

His long robe tore, revealing a powerful physique, his dark skin gleaming with an oily sheen.

In the blink of an eye, Pinghou, without hesitation, revealed his demonic form, transforming into a massive black rhinoceros.  One of his horns was longer than the other, and between them was a silver mark shaped like a crescent moon.  This type of demonic beast was known as the Silver Moon Rhinoceros.

Simultaneously, Guihou also shifted into his beast form, resembling a yellow marten with a fox-like snout, rabbit-like ears, and round, cat-like eyes – a veritable chimera known as the Gui Dog.

Just as their demonic forms materialized, the lightning arrived.

Pinghou, being closer, saw the lightning heading straight for him. The terrifying aura made him unable to suppress the shock in his heart. A hint of madness flashed in his eyes as his horns emitted a dazzling silver light.

The crescent moon between his horns shone even brighter, separating from his head and rising slowly.

‘Crack!’

The silver light intensified, and the crescent moon transformed into a silver bolt of lightning, shooting towards the incoming enemy in a head-on collision.

The silver moon pierced the air, its might equally astonishing.

Yet, the newcomer showed no signs of stopping. The lightning’s radiance fluctuated slightly, and suddenly a sword shadow emerged, detaching from the lightning and pointing directly at Pinghou, before vanishing in a flash.

Pinghou's heart sank, the ominous feeling intensifying. Then, he felt a terrifying killing intent descend upon him.  His mind reeling, everything else in his vision seemed to disappear, leaving only a single sword!

The sword was like autumn water, divine intent flowing within.

Such a spiritual sword, yet a sword of slaughter.

Faintly, seven sword shadows merged into the spiritual sword's body. Qin Sang instantly deployed the Seven Souls Killing Formation.  Murderous aura surged, targeting the silver moon and the rhinoceros behind it. He struck down with a single sword!

“Spiritual Treasure…”

Further back, the astonishment on Guihou’s face morphed into terror.  He wasn't afraid of the Spiritual Treasure itself but the sword strike unleashed by it.

He had fought Daoist cultivators before, witnessed their talisman swords, but never had he seen a sword strike as breathtaking as this.

Astonishing killing intent, unparalleled sword intent – this single strike incorporated the guidance of the Sword Immortal, the essence of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter," and Qin Sang’s own understanding of the Way of the Sword.

‘Crack!’

The silver moon dimmed, a prominent crack appearing in its center, cleaved in two by a single sword strike.

The spiritual sword shattered the moon, its intent still locked onto Pinghou.

Pinghou retreated frantically, all his Qi and blood converging towards his chest. The skin on his chest became transparent, eventually transforming into a round mirror, like a heart-protecting mirror.

Embedded within Pinghou's body, the heart-protecting mirror was a defensive treasure, continuously devouring Qi and blood. The mirror's surface turned crimson, countless strange runes swirling within.

Next, these runes appeared in the real world, right in front of Pinghou, forming a large mirror.

The mirror was identical to the heart-protecting mirror on Pinghou’s chest, but much larger, completely shielding him.

The mirror reflected the sword light and lightning.

Then, ripples spread across its surface, and the reflected sword light and lightning shattered, revealing the Cloud Wanderer Sword and Qin Sang within.

At the same time, the sword light before the mirror took on a faint crimson hue, its momentum subtly stagnating.

Qin Sang also felt a strange restraining force trying to immobilize him.

With a cold snort, Qin Sang unleashed the Pure Glazed Light, instantly shattering the restraining force.  Under Pinghou's shocked gaze, he stepped towards the mirror and swung his right hand, striking the mirror's surface with full force.

‘Boom!’

The mirror trembled violently, its surface rippling intensely, seemingly on the verge of shattering.

At this moment, spiritual light converged in his palm, forming another sword.

The Palm Heart Sword seized the opportunity, piercing the mirror's surface.

‘噗!’

The mirror was pierced by the sword tip.

Pinghou’s eyes bulged. He heard a ripping sound as the flesh on his chest tore, the heart-protecting mirror leaving his body. His only recourse now was to use the treasure’s true form.

Just then, a golden light shot from behind Pinghou. Within the golden light were a dozen golden needles.

These needles were Guihou’s handiwork, incredibly sharp, their Qi interconnected and reinforcing each other, possessing formidable power.

‘Clang! Clang! Clang…’

The needles struck Qin Sang.

Qin Sang didn't even attempt to dodge, standing firm as all the needles found their mark.

But to the two Demon Lords' shock, the needles were all stopped by the armor on Qin Sang's body, failing to injure him in the slightest.

In fact, layered on top of the armor was the Light of Separation and Reunion.

Guihou's cultivation wasn't even comparable to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. Breaking through the divine light was difficult, let alone the Bright Mountain Armor.

Therefore, Qin Sang didn't even spare Guihou a glance.  He pressed his palm forward forcefully, his hand following the Palm Heart Sword through the mirror, reaching out to grab the heart-protecting mirror's true form.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword followed closely behind, its boundless killing intent assaulting Pinghou’s mind.

It appeared as though Qin Sang was determined to capture Pinghou.

But just as Qin Sang was about to collide with the heart-protecting mirror, his hand suddenly paused, his figure vanishing like a phantom from Pinghou's sight.

Pinghou froze for a moment, then realized what had happened, roaring, “Careful!”

The warning came too late. Qin Sang had successfully bypassed Pinghou, appearing before Guihou.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword hadn't changed its target, remaining locked onto Pinghou, preventing him from reacting.

In truth, Qin Sang’s target had always been Guihou. Otherwise, that previous sword strike wouldn’t have merely shattered the silver moon!

Indeed, that strike wasn't the pinnacle of Qin Sang's swordsmanship.

Although that sword strike had incorporated seven sword souls, it wasn't the Cloud Wanderer Sword that had absorbed them, but the sword shadow formed by the Chengying Sword!

Chengying, Chengying – When Qin Sang comprehended the inheritance, the Chengying Sword had been refined into a sword shadow of the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

Initially, the sword shadow possessed less than fifty percent of the Cloud Wanderer Sword's power.  Now, it was nearly sixty percent.

It was the Cloud Wanderer Sword’s sword shadow that truly executed the Seven Souls Killing Formation.  Combined with the Cloud Wanderer Sword’s own power, the strike’s might was no less than any Spiritual Treasure. No one would suspect that it was a feint.

Yet, Qin Sang had held back.

The sword shadow was formless, allowing for surprise attacks and catching opponents off guard.  It could also be used in reverse.

When the Cloud Wanderer Sword truly manifested, it would give the enemy a great surprise.

Qin Sang's actions weren’t meant to deceive the two demons before him. Dealing with them didn’t require such elaborate schemes.

…

‘Whoosh!’

Guihou only saw a blur.  The enemy, who had been fighting Pinghou moments before, suddenly appeared before him, filling him with terror.

Seeing the bright armor on Qin Sang, unscathed despite being struck by the golden needles, he was terrified beyond words.

‘Whimper…’

Guihou let out a strange howl, his fur standing on end, specks of golden light appearing all over his body.

Each hair transformed into a golden needle, their tips aimed at Qin Sang as they shot outwards.

Countless golden needles filled the sky, their golden light merging into a continuous sheet.  At the center, a single point of golden light was particularly dazzling, like a golden chisel, aimed directly at Qin Sang's throat.

The next moment, Guihou witnessed a despairing sight.

The golden chisel clearly struck its target, yet it was as if it had hit an impenetrable wall. His opponent merely swayed, completely unharmed!

This attack was indeed extraordinary, a technique Guihou had refined over many years, his most prized magical power.  Ordinary cultivators wouldn't dare to face it head-on.

Unfortunately, it encountered the Bright Mountain Armor.  The fragments of the True Treasure could separate and combine, effortlessly blocking the golden chisel.

Qin Sang was covered in golden needles, his gaze cold as he charged through the barrage, directly at Guihou.

…

“Insolent!”

“How dare you!”

As Qin Sang approached Guihou, two furious roars echoed from the distance – Lingyouwang and Dingxianghou, arriving a step too late.

Qin Sang, utilizing his escape techniques without reservation, hadn't been quiet, alerting Lingyouwang and Dingxianghou.

The black cloth beneath Lingyouwang's feet had vanished, replaced by black ripples propelling them forward at an astonishing speed.  Yet, they were still a step too late, the situation having deteriorated drastically.

Qin Sang had long been aware of the pursuers. It was these two demons he was wary of, especially the other cultivator who exuded an unsettling aura, his strength unfathomable.

Knowing it would be difficult to subdue Pinghou before the pursuers arrived, Qin Sang had feigned his attack, unexpectedly targeting Guihou instead.

He didn't look back. His figure, though not particularly imposing, appeared to Guihou like a death god.

‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’

All the treasures and magical powers Guihou unleashed in his panic were effortlessly countered by Qin Sang, utterly ineffective.

‘Crack!’

His forearm snapped.

He was plunged into despair, but hearing the roars of Lingyouwang and Dingxianghou, a glimmer of hope rekindled in his eyes.

“Your Highness, save me!”

Guihou cried hoarsely.

Your Highness!

Hearing these words, Qin Sang was startled, his expression changing drastically.

At this moment, he finally understood. There were no hidden experts.  Those mysterious figures he'd been so wary of were the Demon King and the Grand True Masters!
