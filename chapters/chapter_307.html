Chapter 300: Harpies


As they spoke, darkness suddenly fell before their eyes.  A flock of harpies, screeching shrilly, swooped down towards Ge Yuan. Clearly, his theft of the spirit herbs had enraged them.


Among them, one was slightly smaller but much faster than the others. Its feathers, like black iron, appeared incredibly hard.


With a flap of its wings, the harpy turned into a black streak, instantly appearing above Ge Yuan. Its speed was astonishing. Sharp talons, gleaming coldly, lashed out at Ge Yuan’s head.


The aura this harpy suddenly unleashed was terrifying, even startling Qin Sang. It was a late-stage Spirit Severing realm demon!


The other harpies were much weaker. Only one was early-stage Spirit Severing; the rest were lesser demons of the Mortal Severing realm.


No wonder Luo Xingnan and the others hadn't gained the upper hand. Facing a late-stage Spirit Severing demon, surviving its talons was already a feat.


Also, someone seemed to be missing.


Only Luo Xingnan, Yun Youzi, Shangguan Lifeng, and the scholar in white remained.


Elder Gong was gone!


Ge Yuan himself was even more horrified.


This harpy was terrifyingly strong, two full realms above him.

Even under normal circumstances, escaping this harpy would be difficult, let alone now, when he was at his most vulnerable, sent flying by Luo Xingnan's jade fork, his breath unsteady.


'Whoosh!'


The harpy spread its wings, demonic power swirling into a gale that pinned Ge Yuan to the ground, effortlessly crushing any attempt to escape.


Ge Yuan was terrified, about to die under the harpy’s talons.


At this critical moment, Yun Youzi reacted swiftly, abruptly throwing a yellow copper ring.


'Whoosh… Whoosh…'


The ring emitted a strong yellow light, then split into dozens of identical phantom images in mid-air, all striking the harpy.


Unexpectedly, the harpy stumbled back after being hit, roaring in anger. The other harpies, seemingly aware of the ring's power, retreated with frightened cries.


Ge Yuan finally seized the opportunity, scrambling to his feet and fleeing without looking back.


Qin Sang watched closely, noticing that the formation of Yun Youzi's group remained unbroken. Everyone wielded identical yellow copper rings.


It was a set of restriction-based artifacts!


Understanding dawned on Qin Sang.  This was why they didn't seem too panicked facing a late-stage Spirit Severing demon.  They were relying on these artifacts to fight.


Otherwise, they would have likely met the same fate as Sheng Yuanzi.


“What are you doing?!”


Luo Xingnan glared at Yun Youzi, furious that he had intervened.


Yun Youzi's expression remained unchanged. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the outer formation's weak phase is almost over. We don't have much time. An extra hand is more strength. We need to suppress this beast quickly and send someone to gather the herbs."


At the same time, Yun Youzi's voice transmission reached Qin Sang's ear, revealing that Elder Gong was dead.


Like Ge Yuan, he had triggered a restriction while gathering herbs, alerting the harpies.


But Elder Gong was unlucky. He was the harpies’ first target, killed instantly with a talon through the skull, without any chance to resist.


The others were horrified, abandoning their individual efforts and hastily gathering together to defend against the harpies’ onslaught. Yun Youzi had brought out this set of restriction-based artifacts, known as the Golden Ring Formation, managing to stabilize their situation and withstand the harpies' attacks.


But even with the Golden Ring Formation, killing the harpies was almost impossible, and they didn't have time to keep fighting.


All they could do was use the artifacts to trap the harpies, send someone to retrieve the spirit herbs, and then escape!


Luo Xingnan snorted, accepting Yun Youzi's explanation. He manipulated the copper ring to create countless phantom images, continuing to attack the harpy.  He then swept his hand over the ring, separating two and tossing them to Qin Sang and Ge Yuan, ordering them without a hint of doubt, "You two, block these birds. I'm going to collect the herbs!"


"Wait!"


Yun Youzi stopped Luo Xingnan. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the demons are powerful. Without you here, I'm afraid it will be difficult to suppress them. To be safe, it's better to let Daoist Qingfeng collect the herbs, and then we'll divide them evenly on the spot."


Luo Xingnan's face stiffened, suddenly realizing something was amiss.


His gaze shifted between Qin Sang, Ge Yuan, and Yun Youzi. His expression grew increasingly furious, and he cursed, "Old man, are they your people?"


"They are not 'my people.' I merely know these two fellow Daoists," Yun Youzi said calmly.


"Good! Very good!"


Luo Xingnan's anger turned into a chilling laugh.  He repeated "good" twice, his voice extremely gloomy.  "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. I admit defeat today! Old man, you dare scheme against me? You have guts! Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?!"


"Fellow Daoist Luo, you exaggerate!"


Yun Youzi was completely unafraid of Luo Xingnan's murderous gaze. He looked at Shangguan Lifeng and the scholar in white. "All fellow Daoists risked entering this place for the treasures. We, unlike Yu Kong, do not have a deep hatred for Fellow Daoist Luo. I never intended to harm you, so how can you speak of scheming? From my observation, although most of the spirit herbs in the mountain have been destroyed by these beasts, seven still remain. The protective restrictions around the herbs are powerful, preventing these beasts from intruding. There are six of us; one herb per person is more than enough. Fellow Daoist Luo's previous promise was also to this effect. Why are you so angry that I brought up dividing them evenly? Could it be… Fellow Daoist Luo, were you just saying that?"


"You…"


Confronted directly by Yun Youzi, Luo Xingnan's face froze, his eyes filled with shock and anger.


Not giving Luo Xingnan a chance to speak, Yun Youzi addressed the scholar in white, bypassing Shangguan Lifeng, "Fellow Daoist, what are your thoughts?"


The scholar in white glanced at Luo Xingnan and Shangguan Lifeng.  Under Luo Xingnan's intense gaze, he hesitated for a moment before saying, "I believe Fellow Daoist Yun Youzi's words are reasonable."


As he spoke, the scholar in white subconsciously moved closer to Yun Youzi.


However, Yun Youzi didn't want to push Luo Xingnan too hard, lest he lose control.  He added, "Breaking the restrictions will take some time. Daoist Qingfeng alone might find it difficult. Fellow Daoist Luo, why not designate another person? Two working together should be sufficient. Moreover, we are able to reach this place thanks to Fellow Daoist Luo's planning.  Of the seven spirit herbs, Fellow Daoist Luo taking two is only right. What do you all think?"


With Elder Gong dead, only Shangguan Lifeng remained on Luo Xingnan's side. Yun Youzi's intentions were practically spelled out.


Apart from Luo Xingnan, even if others were greedy, they weren't in a position to demand more. They immediately nodded in agreement.
