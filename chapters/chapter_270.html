**Chapter 263: Pointing the Way**

Elder Di Que lived.

Qin Sang could only hide in the shadows and dare not show himself.

If he didn’t want to be trapped to death in the volcano, jumping into the lava might not allow him to find a way out before his spiritual energy ran out. Not to mention the unknown dangers lurking in the lava.

Even if he was able to find a way out, he didn’t know where this ancient cultivator’s abode truly was, nor the environment nearby. If he was unlucky enough to enter the depths of the ancient immortal battlefield, where spatial rifts permeated the area, that would be a dead end as well.

Even if he could escape with his life, he would become a stray dog, hunted by Elder Di Que, and forced to flee to the demon realm. He might even need to leave Small Glacial Domain to feel safe.

Even if he managed to get away safely, how likely was it that he could cultivate to the peak of Foundation Establishment and gather enough resources to form a Golden Core without the support of his sect?

As long as he got rid of Elder Di Que, everything would be resolved.

Elder Di Que and Daoist Profound Mystery had disappeared, and Uncle Che and the others would definitely search the mountain. He only needed to stay at the volcano’s crater and think of an excuse to explain himself.

Most importantly, he wouldn’t have to worry about exposing the jade Buddha.

And so, Qin Sang took action.

Of course, time didn’t allow Qin Sang to think too carefully.

Daoist Profound Mystery had overdrawn his Golden Core, and the power he had gained wouldn’t last long. It would quickly dissipate. If he didn’t act soon, once Daoist Profound Mystery’s Golden Core power dissipated somewhat, it would no longer pose a life-threatening danger to Elder Di Que.

By then, Qin Sang wouldn’t be able to handle Elder Di Que, even if he was injured.

When the opportune moment arrived, he had to seize it immediately or regret it later.

Daoist Profound Mystery couldn’t find Elder Di Que, but Qin Sang could help him. With Daoist Profound Mystery’s death-defying attack, coupled with the endless firebirds, there was no better opportunity than now!

Qin Sang saw the gains and losses and a glimmer of hope for success, so he immediately decided to act.

He had been holding the Ten Yama Wraith Banner for self-defense since before. The Ten Yama Wraith Banner abruptly unfurled, and all of the soul ghosts, including the main soul, were instantly sucked out.

All of their soul power transformed into soul-devouring threads, and ghostly flames surged. Countless soul-devouring threads drifted towards the firebird that Elder Di Que had transformed into like the hair of evil ghosts floating out of hell.

The Ten Yama Wraith Formation, composed of six ghost banners at their peak, had greater power than a talisman treasure. However, Qin Sang, as the one presiding over the formation, had a power disparity with Elder Di Que that couldn’t be compensated for with magic tools.

Fortunately, Qin Sang didn’t expect the Ten Yama Wraith Formation to injure Elder Di Que. He just needed to point the way for Daoist Profound Mystery, and that would be enough!

The appearance of the Ten Yama Wraith Banner was too sudden and completely unexpected by Elder Di Que. He was focusing all his attention on Daoist Profound Mystery and had disguised himself as a firebird, unable to use any of his spiritual power or divine consciousness. His movements were far less agile than before. By the time he realized the soul-devouring threads, it was already too late.

“Swoosh…”

The soul-devouring threads swept forward and instantly surrounded Elder Di Que, burning his primordial spirit.

“Ten Yama Wraith Banner!”

Elder Di Que clearly recognized the Kui Yin Sect’s famous magic tool and immediately thought of Qin Sang. He couldn’t help but be surprised, and furious. The ant that he could have crushed to death with just a flick of his hand hadn’t died and had actually been lurking until now, giving him a vicious blow!

The appearance of the Ten Yama Wraith Banner had disturbed the groups of firebirds circling in the vicinity, and they instantly entered a frenzy. Their cries suddenly grew shrill and piercing.

So many firebirds.

Qin Sang’s ears were filled with only the cries of the firebirds, and his ears buzzed. If not for the protection of the jade Buddha, his primordial spirit would have been shattered in an instant.

Elder Di Que was at the center of the cacophony, and even though his primordial spirit was strong, he couldn’t ignore the impact. The flames on his body flickered violently, revealing the outline of his physical body.

If he made a move to resist, there would be no turning back. More and more startled firebirds were gathering around him, surrounding him closely.

Feeling the soaring power of the sonic impact, Elder Di Que felt his primordial spirit trembling and was utterly horrified.

To make matters worse, Daoist Profound Mystery outside had also discovered the strange situation. He turned his Heavenly Star Saber Talisman and locked onto Elder Di Que, disappearing in a flash.

Daoist Profound Mystery was already determined to die and didn’t care if there was a dead end ahead.

“Seeking death!”

Elder Di Que hated Qin Sang to the extreme. At such a critical moment, he knew that there was no way out, so he actually retaliated with a bolt of spiritual power, aiming to kill Qin Sang first!

Qin Sang’s heart sank, and he immediately pressed the corpse puppet bag. The zombie puppet and the zombie flew out together. The zombie was instantly annihilated by the spiritual power, and the two zombie puppets only lasted for a moment.

Then, several beams of light shot out from the mustard seed bag, the various magic tools that Qin Sang had collected over the years, all with defensive effects.

The magic weapon that Qin Sang set his sights on wouldn't be weak, but it was also destroyed with overwhelming force.
Qin Sang's expression was extremely calm. He glanced at the surrounding situation.
The firebirds had also discovered his presence. Fiery hurricanes attacked. Not only did Qin Sang not evade, conversely he protected weaknesses, and proactively met one of the flames. He only noticed intense, full-body pain and became gravely injured, but thanks to the immense impact, he dodged the attack of the landless old man.
That spiritual power grazed Qin Sang's back, tearing off a large piece of flesh with ease, revealing bone.
Adding insult to injury, Qin Sang gasped. Then, his vision was suddenly filled with blinding light. The firebirds were engulfed by white light, and their screams carried a sense of panic.
Amidst the cries of the firebirds, there was also Xuan Yu's stern voice and the crazy sound of the landless old man.
Success!
Happiness filled Qin Sang's heart. Ignoring the intense pain in his body, he hastily retracted the Youfang Yanluo Banner. At the last moment, he grew bold, shook the evil spirit thread, and rapidly grabbed something in the middle of the white light, and then quickly retreated.
Not one part of his whole body was intact.
Either the firebird's powerful hurricane or the attack of the landless old man was enough to kill him.
Thinking of the dangerous situation just now, Qin Sang felt lingering fear. He coughed up blood, quickly swallowed a healing elixer of the landless old man, wiped away the bloody smell on his body, and concealed himself once again.
After putting away the Youfang Yanluo Banner, Qin Sang discovered that what was wrapped inside was the landless old man's mustard seed pouch. Great joy filled his heart. At least he hadn't taken such a risk in vain. The loss of those corpses and magic weapons was worth it!
There were restrictions from the landless old man on the mustard seed pouch, but the landless old man was dead, so it became an ownerless item. More importantly, Qin Sang found that this restriction was made up of the power of illusory music.
Benefitting from the coercion of the landless old man, his attainment in the way of restrictions advanced rapidly, and he was also very familiar with illusory music. If he put some effort into it, he should be able to crack it.
Qin Sang suppressed the excitement in his heart, put away the mustard seed pouch, and carefully observed the surrounding situation, only to see a white light flash out from among the firebird group. Daoist Xuan Yu was incredibly strong. He was actually still not dead.
The white light dimmed, revealing the tattered Knife Talisman and a golden elixir filled with cracks.
'Pa!'
The golden elixir and the Knife Talisman shattered together, turning into specks of light and scattering into nothingness.
The primordial spirit of Daoist Xuan Yu flew out,虚幻到了极点。
