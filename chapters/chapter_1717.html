<h1>Chapter 1708: The Seal</h1><p>The journey continues across the Western Desert.</p><p>A portal opens to the North Sea.</p><p>They enter the storm zone.</p><p>Howling winds rage, figures flying through the tempest.</p><p>Soon, a golden light approaches, revealing a serene monk who greets Hui Guang and the others with clasped hands.</p><p>“Xing Zhi, how did the beast-luring go?” Hui Guang asks.</p><p>“Master Uncle, reports from the various sects are positive; the lures are working as planned, no casualties yet.  However, no one dares approach the beast; its strength remains unknown…”</p><p>Xing Zhi reports the situation.</p><p>Hui Guang nods, glancing at the Qing Hu Saint King.</p><p>“Old monk, set up the formation here. There must be no mistakes; this battle allows only victory!” The Qing Hu Saint King steps forward, vanishing into the heart of the storm.</p><p>The others follow Hui Guang, soon spotting five towering pillars rising from the sea.</p><p>There are no islands beneath the pillars; their foundations are unknown. A cultivator sits atop each pillar.</p><p>The pillars' material is extraordinary, forged by humans and demons together.  Identical pillars and guards are stationed in the south, but they're not needed yet.</p><p>Before reaching the pillars, a cultivator's transformed self senses something.  “The Golden Rainbow Array, the Earth-Nourishing Array… all common five-element arrays in the cultivation world.”</p><p>He recalls the Five Elements Divine Prohibition on Emperor's Mount.  These arrays lack the divine prohibition's power but are more flexible, operated by skilled cultivators.</p><p>Hui Guang assigns the five-element arrays' leadership to Buddhist monks.</p><p>Additional arrays with different functions are deployed around the perimeter, creating a formidable trap.</p><p>The formation is quickly completed.</p><p>More experts arrive, following the Buddhist orders, some stationed on the perimeter for reduced pressure.  Others wish to test the beast's power firsthand, entering the five-element array.</p><p>The transformed cultivator remains outside, but sees Mo Xing Dao summoned into the array by Hui Guang.</p><p>“The Saint King and I must control the five elements to wield the Five Elements Crown, leaving us unable to spare ourselves.  When the beast appears, you must use the puppets to lure it into the trap,” Hui Guang instructs Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>With many cultivators assisting, the main array monks share the burden, allowing two Nascent Soul cultivators to manage the Crown, freeing Mo Xing Dao's hands.</p><p>This differs from the Eight Scenery Hunt; the lures must continuously engage and adjust, requiring others to act only when the beast reaches the array's energy convergence point.  No mistakes are allowed.  Only the two Nascent Soul cultivators and the puppets skilled in Yin-Yang evasion techniques can accomplish this.</p><p>The trap is set, and they wait.</p><p>Unnoticed, someone approaches.</p><p>Qin Sang, light as a swallow, floats on the water's surface, maintaining a safe distance.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang closes his eyes, remaining still.</p><p>Days turn into weeks, a month passes without the beast.</p><p>As doubts arise, Qing Hu Saint King returns.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A green shadow bursts through the waves, entering the array.</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King's tone is grave: “Careful, the beast may be stronger than early Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Hui Guang and Mo Xing Dao are serious but resolute.</p><p>Regardless of the beast's strength, they must confront it. They can't afford to wait any longer.</p><p>“Mo Daoist…”</p><p>Hui Guang looks to Mo Xing Dao, who nods, listening to Qing Hu Saint King's description.  Then he flies alone towards the indicated direction, a shadow trailing behind.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Waves batter the pillars, causing them to sink.</p><p>All eyes are on the storm, hearts pounding.</p><p>Suddenly, a roar, like thunder, shakes the earth. The roar indicates distance, yet its pressure penetrates storm and water, causing immense oppression and awe, the likes of which none have witnessed.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The roars grow closer.</p><p>Soon, cultivators with keen sight detect something.</p><p>Waves surge; a colossal figure emerges from the storm.</p><p>Both humans and demons are present, and seeing this immense beast, they recall the infamous Dragon Whale Saint of the East Sea.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Sage, possessing the bloodline of a dragon whale, is hailed as the greatest sage among the demon clan.  Independent of the Saint King's Palace, his true form is a massive dragon whale, the largest in the East Sea, yet dwarfed by the monstrous beast before them.</p><p>A wall of water advanced at terrifying speed, the sea beyond pitch black.</p><p>The beast's body, shaped like a manta ray, was black as night.  Its immense wings spanned the horizon; a single flap sent mountainous waves crashing, a spectacle as terrifying as the collapse of heaven and earth.</p><p>A figure flickered before the beast.</p><p>Insignificant against the monster, the figure seemed destined for annihilation; a single wave would crush him.  Yet, he persevered, vanishing and reappearing before each attack.</p><p>Enraged by the elusive insect, the beast pursued relentlessly.</p><p>"Activate the formation!"</p><p>慧光圣者's warning reached everyone simultaneously.</p><p>Huasheng, his gaze darkening, assessed the beast, sensing an even greater power than the one encountered before.</p><p>The figure, luring the beast, reappeared near the formation, slipping through a gap specifically left open.</p><p>As the puppet charged, a shadow fell.</p><p>Looking up, the assembled warriors gasped in horror. The beast soared into the sky, its wings blotting out the sun. Its left wing, a gale of unimaginable force, targeted the puppet, unleashing a devastating blow.</p><p>This was no mere gust of wind, but a force of nature, enough to crush any ordinary being.  Yet, the puppet vanished again.</p><p>Instantly, a five-colored crown materialized above the beast.</p><p>Though dwarfed by the creature, the crown emanated a power that was in no way inferior.</p><p>慧光圣者 and Qinghu Saint King stood on either side of the crown.  Five celestial pillars rose from the sea, forming a five-element array.  Five distinct phenomena manifested, yet interconnected through the crown, forming a colossal, multi-colored canopy that shielded the beast from the sky.</p><p>A burst of light erupted from the five-element crown, similar yet vastly stronger than before.</p><p>The power of the five elements, both positive and negative, was used: positive for restraint, negative for annihilation.  The ancient demon had only used negative power, aiming to kill. Now, the focus was on containment.</p><p>Multicolored light engulfed the beast, its black body taking on vibrant hues as concentric rings of light tightened like a cage.</p><p>Simultaneously, the sound of piercing air filled the space as iron chains, resembling dragons, shot into the formation.  The chains intertwined, binding the beast and further restricting its movement.</p><p>Huasheng was among those manipulating the chains.</p><p>Other phenomena unfolded in perfect coordination, effectively sealing the beast within this domain.  To any who knew the plan, the trap seemed inescapable.</p><p>Then came a horrifying sight.</p><p>As the cage took shape, the beast roared, waves of energy surged heavenward, a force capable of shaking the very foundations of the world.</p><p>Chains snapped, pillars trembled. The five-element crown held, but the two transformative deities swayed.</p><p>莫行道, appearing from afar, was shaken.</p><p>The lures had been perilous, depleting the treasures given to him by the transformative deities.</p><p>After taking some pills to recover, he flew towards the battle.</p><p>About to join the formation, a transmission arrived:  “Daoist Mo, do you have the Spiritual Rhinoceros Fruit?”</p><p>It was Qin Sang, seizing the opportune moment to trade!</p><p>莫行道 paused, a flicker in his eyes, surprised. “Daoist Friend, do you have the Five Element Pills?”</p><p>After a brief exchange, 莫行道 remained on the outer edge, remotely controlling the puppet to assist.</p><p>The clash had reached its peak.</p><p>The beast unleashed its full power, but the meticulously laid trap and the transformative deities wouldn't be easily overcome.</p><p>Initially chaotic, the defenders gradually learned the beast's attack patterns and adapted.</p><p>Chains closed, snapped, and repeated countless times, exhausting the warriors.</p><p>"Prepare for the final array!"</p><p>慧光圣者's voice was grave.  Success meant a 50% chance of capturing the beast, but the risks were immense.</p><p>Liu Daoyou…”</p><p>Huasheng looked at a tall, thin Daoist beside him. This person was an elder of the Qiongying sect, rumored to be from an overseas fairy island.</p><p>The Liu surname cultivator understood and took over controlling the iron chain from Huasheng.  Similar rotations were happening elsewhere.</p><p>Those relieved of their duties retreated to recover their qi, but Huasheng retreated further and further, then turned and fled into the heart of the storm, disappearing without a trace.  Those who saw this were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even though it was a crucial moment in the formation, the Qinghu Saint King glanced over, a look of disdain flashing in her eyes, before dismissing it.</p><p>Just as Mo Xingdao felt surprised and perplexed, he heard a voice, "Daoist Mo, long time no see."</p><p>The voice was very close. Mo Xingdao's back tensed, his body growing cold. He abruptly turned his head, seeing a figure appear beside him.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>He never expected Qin Sang to dare to appear in person!</p><p>No, not in person, but a phantom condensed from his divine sense.  This wasn't a simple divine sense projection; it had condensed into a true form!</p><p>Mo Xingdao fully extended his divine sense, becoming even more shocked. The person's real body was definitely nearby, yet he hadn't noticed it at all.</p><p>The phantom held a jade bottle, smiling at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent, taking out the Lingxi Immortal Fruit.</p><p>They confirmed the authenticity of each other's treasures.</p><p>The phantom vanished in a flash, disappearing to an unknown location, leaving only the words, "Thank you, Daoist friend, for your cooperation. Until we meet again!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent, glancing at the fiercely fought battlefield. He wasn't sure if the two Nascent Soul cultivators had noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, he turned to gaze at the boundless storm, silent for a moment, before letting out a soft sigh.</p><p>In the distance, the main body and the phantom reunited, put away their treasures without lingering, and vanished.</p><p>"There was no ambush by the Demon Kings…"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen problems, he chose to conduct the exchange now, cunningly choosing the crucial moment of the formation.</p><p>He thought the Qinghu Saint King might order her Demon King subordinates to lay an ambush, and Qin Sang didn't mind killing a few Demon Kings to enrich his treasury.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Qinghu Saint King actually kept her word.</p><p>However, although the Qinghu Saint King had the title of Saint King, she lacked the substance.  Her killing intent was too strong, and she didn't concern herself with external affairs. The major clans of the East Sea demon race feared her, but their submission was only superficial, secretly conspiring and disobeying her in secret.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King had limited usable demons under her command, and other Demon Kings might not be willing to offend a powerful enemy for her.</p><p>The journey was unimpeded.  Escaping the storm zone, Qin Sang didn't think further and went straight back to Luye.</p><p>Gathering spirit arrays, pills, spirit materials…</p><p>Qin Sang put away all the treasures, but he didn't check them immediately.</p><p>There was one thing he had been eagerly anticipating, waiting only for the return of his phantom.</p><p>Luye changed direction, heading west along the edge of the North Sea.</p><p>It stopped near the storm zone, in an uninhabited area in the west.</p><p>Qin Sang took his phantom out of Luye and into a desolate mountain range.</p><p>This was a place Qin Sang had specifically chosen to summon the Heavenly Demon.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>Two figures flew to the sky above a basin.</p><p>The Mingyue Guards guarding the basin sensed something and flew up to pay their respects.</p><p>"Patrol the surroundings. No one is allowed to approach!"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a stern order and landed on the ground.</p><p>Several black, square high platforms stood in the basin, their material indistinguishable.</p><p>There were seven platforms in total, arranged according to the positions of the Big Dipper.  There were no connections between them, but they possessed a mysterious aura, constantly circulating among them.</p><p>This was the altar needed for the "Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture."  It was less an altar and more a special formation that could break through invisible barriers and call upon the extra-dimensional Heavenly Demons.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed to the position opposite the handle of the dipper.</p><p>His phantom came over, standing behind Qin Sang, acting as a protector while also ready to replace him and take any damage.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down cross-legged, his mind focused inward, sitting quietly for a long time, silently practicing the secret technique of the "Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture."</p><p>The next moment, one of the seven platforms glowed with black light.</p><p>Above the platform, in the black light, a mass of black energy twisted and writhed.</p><p>Then the second platform showed similar changes.</p><p>The order in which the platforms changed was not strictly according to their distance from Qin Sang, with no discernible pattern.</p><p>As more and more platforms underwent changes, masses of black energy enveloped Qin Sang.  His consciousness sank into darkness, seeming to be pulled into the depths of boundless void by a strange force.</p><p>He heard strange sounds, not human voices, as if countless strange energies were flowing in the void.</p><p>His mind remained clear; he did not lose himself, focusing on recalling the scriptures.</p><p>According to the scriptures, upon completing the secret technique and contacting the Heavenly Demon, there would be a special feeling.</p><p>However, as time passed, after completing the secret technique, Qin Sang felt nothing unusual.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, a sudden chill descended.</p><p>"It's here!"</p>
