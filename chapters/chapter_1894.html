<h1>Chapter 1885: The Nine Levels of Heaven</h1><p>Qin Sang fled the Divine Hall, the roar of collapse echoing behind him. The shimmering barrier, unable to withstand the onslaught of the black rainbow, shattered, and the Divine Hall crumbled.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, the statue of Gengchen Taisui, enshrined within the hall, toppled to the ground from the impact but remained inert, offering no retaliation against the culprit.</p><p>Thus, even if he sought refuge in the Divine Hall of a higher-ranking deity, the black demonic roc wouldn't hesitate to attack without restraint.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Demonic winds surged over the ruins of the Divine Hall. The black demonic roc materialized, recalling its Thunder Mirror.  Seeing the treasure's spiritual light dimmed, it flew into a rage, a white light erupting from its chest, transforming into an iron ring.</p><p>The outer rim of the iron ring bristled with sharp spikes, while its inner circle was hollow. As it spun rapidly, the spikes on its outer edge lit up, radiating sharp edges.</p><p>The light converged towards the inner circle, growing increasingly blinding.  When the light reached its peak, it suddenly burst forth.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The piercing sound filled the air.  Arrow-like white streamers shot out, each incredibly sharp, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that being struck by one of these arrows would spell disaster.  He could only dodge with all his might.</p><p>The iron ring whirled, arrows constantly shooting forth, its power no less formidable than the Thunder Mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. It was indeed impossible to turn the tide with just a single Blood Defilement Divine Light. He abandoned any lingering hope of a miracle and focused solely on escape.</p><p>The pursuer and the pursued distanced themselves from the mountain, leaving behind only the collapsed Divine Hall and a toppled deity statue.</p><p>It turned out that disabling the Thunder Mirror wasn't in vain.  While the iron ring's assault was intense, it couldn't be sustained, easing the pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>During the chase, whenever Qin Sang felt the enemy's attack intensify, pushing him to his limits, he would find an opportunity to hide in a Divine Hall.</p><p>Seeking refuge in the halls not only allowed him to catch his breath but also benefited the Celestial Chariot. Every instantaneous translocation brought the Celestial Chariot closer to destruction, a process of gradual decay initiated by Qin Sang's repairs.</p><p>However, Qin Sang discovered that the chariot's deterioration also had a connection to the golden dragon pulling it.  The dragon seemed capable of drawing energy from the Divine Court, nourishing the chariot in return. Allowing the chariot to remain within the Divine Court for a longer period might allow it to recover on its own.</p><p>Unfortunately, this wasn't feasible while on the run.  The golden dragon could only recover during their brief stays within the Divine Halls.  This recovery was meager, unable to reverse the chariot's inevitable destruction.</p><p>As time passed, the golden dragon's form grew increasingly ethereal. Yet, each time they left a Divine Hall, it would solidify slightly.  Moreover, by preparing beforehand, the stress on the Celestial Chariot during translocation lessened.</p><p>Qin Sang racked his brains, clinging tenaciously to any advantage, no matter how small.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The Celestial Chariot weaved through the storm of arrows.  Qin Sang, seated on the jade throne, his face grim, rapidly scanned the surrounding celestial mountains and Divine Halls.</p><p>He was searching for the Divine Hall of a higher-ranking deity.  The halls he had encountered so far were mostly those of the Sixty Jiazi Taisui Gods and scattered Star Lords of the River of Heaven.</p><p>These deities held similar ranks, their shimmering barriers offering limited protection. A higher-ranking deity might possess a more robust barrier.</p><p>"This is the Western White Tiger's Seven Mansions. Above the scattered stars should be the Seven Mansion Star Lords…"</p><p>Qin Sang first passed through Kui Mansion, the first of the Western Seven Mansions, but didn't find the Kui Mansion Star Lord's Divine Hall.</p><p>Each mansion encompassed multiple stars, and Qin Sang couldn't guess where the Divine Court might have enshrined the Kui Mansion Star Lord.  With pursuers on his heels, he couldn't conduct a thorough search. He might have missed it, or perhaps the hall had already been destroyed.</p><p>Lou Mansion, connected to Kui Mansion, was the second mansion in the West.</p><p>Qin Sang traversed Kui Mansion, fleeing into Lou, then to Wei, Mao, and finally Bi Mansion, where he finally found the Bi Mansion Star Lord!</p><p>Directly ahead, a noticeably taller celestial mountain pierced the sea of clouds, its Divine Hall radiating a brilliant light.</p><p>The plaque before the hall bore six characters written in cloud script: Bi Mansion Star Lord Celestial Ear!</p><p>From its appearance, the Bi Mansion Star Lord's Divine Hall remained intact.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately directed the Celestial Chariot towards the hall.</p><p>The black demonic roc behind him also spotted the Bi Mansion Star Lord's Divine Hall.  A flicker of annoyance flashed in its demonic eyes, its killing intent intensifying.</p><p>It unleashed all its power, but no matter how mighty, if its attacks missed or failed to detain its target, they were futile.  Qin Sang, relying on the Celestial Chariot's potent divine power, consistently dodged or translocated away.</p><p>The demonic roc, resorting to a tremendously draining divine ability, not only failed to trap Qin Sang but allowed him to widen the distance, infuriating the roc.</p><p>Before setting out, it had boasted to the Azure Scaled Serpent, but now, having failed to subdue Qin Sang after so long, it had lost face.</p><p>It had been tasked with swiftly securing the Celestial Chariot, but instead, it was being dragged along by Qin Sang, risking jeopardizing the greater plan.  How could it face the Great Sage upon its return?</p><p>Unaware of the roc's thoughts, Qin Sang urged the golden dragon into the Divine Hall, passing through the shimmering barrier unimpeded, as before.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>The chariot landed, the golden dragon collapsing motionless, focusing all its energy on recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the statue within the hall. The Bi Mansion Star Lord, dignified and imposing, clad in a white fur robe with a sword at his waist, possessed an extraordinary air. His features, unlike a typical statue, resembled those of a mortal.</p><p>The statues Qin Sang had encountered in the Divine Court varied greatly. Some, with multiple heads and arms, conformed to legends, while others appeared more human.</p><p>"When the Divine Court created these deity statues, they likely didn't solely rely on legends. There were other considerations. Perhaps they chose virtuous figures who had contributed to the Daoist sect, merging their images with those of legendary deities, a different form of reverence and传承…" Qin Sang mused, gazing at the Bi Mansion Star Lord. The statue shimmered, its expression gaining a touch of animation, as if on the verge of coming alive. A unique power emanated from its form.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A roar echoed from outside, the ground trembling violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.  Seeing the scene outside, his expression gradually eased.</p><p>Hundreds of arrows launched from the iron ring bombarded the shimmering barrier, all deflected.  Though ripples disturbed the light, the barrier was clearly more robust than those of previous halls, capable of enduring longer.</p><p>Ignoring the commotion outside, Qin Sang scrutinized the Bi Mansion Star Lord.</p><p>He had witnessed this state in other deity statues before, but time constraints prevented investigation.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, recalling a type of Daoist spell – summoning deities and generals.  It was said that this spell could grant the practitioner and their forces the blessings of divine power, or even channel a deity's descent, allowing the caster to transform into a divine being.</p><p>Because the deities didn't respond, these spells had all become ineffective, leading Qin Sang to question the deities' origins.</p><p>Now he knew that the deities were these statues.  Their unresponsiveness was due to the Divine Court's closure, the connection severed.</p><p>With the Divine Court's reappearance, could these spells be used again?</p><p>"Someone is summoning the Bi Mansion Star Lord.  Are Daoist cultivators battling demons?  Do I have to wait for the outcome in the lower realm for a turning point?"  Qin Sang's thoughts raced, pondering his predicament, while simultaneously finding inspiration.</p><p>"The Ghost Fang Kingdom's demonic arts are also rooted in the Divine Court. The summoner might not be a Daoist cultivator. But why isn't that roc summoning a deity?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked outside, darkness consuming the sea of clouds, encroaching closer.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, demons could indeed use such spells, but they were far less proficient than Daoist cultivators.</p><p>Firstly, demonic arts were adaptations of Daoist techniques, inevitably leading to incompatibilities. The Ghost Fang Kingdom prioritized Altar Guardian Generals, ensuring their demons could summon these guardians to protect their nascent souls, making it difficult to master all aspects of summoning.</p><p>Secondly, since the Divine Court's decline, deity summoning spells had become ineffective. Naturally, the Ghost Fang Kingdom wouldn't waste resources on them.</p><p>The black demonic roc had dabbled in such arts in its spare time.  Had it entered the Divine Court before converting to the divine path, it might have succeeded.</p><p>Now, having embraced the divine path and merged with the deities of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, it hadn't fully grasped the divine path, unsure of specific summoning methods.</p><p>Even if it could summon a deity, it would likely be limited to those from the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, whose remaining deities held lower ranks than itself.  Receiving their divine empowerment wouldn't alter the current situation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't privy to these intricacies. He was pondering whether he could leverage the power of a deity to resolve his crisis.</p><p>Unfortunately, he only had a superficial understanding of such spells. High-level summoning techniques were closely guarded secrets of the Daoist sects. He wouldn't have previously expended substantial resources to acquire spells useless to him.</p><p>To his knowledge, summoning required specific rituals, including hand seals, pacing patterns, incantations, and more.  The Yu Pace and the Hand-Eye Seal were crucial elements of Daoist practice, essential for summoning and control.</p><p>Especially when summoning a deity of higher rank than oneself, these intricate rituals, mastered only by orthodox Daoist masters, were indispensable.</p><p>Even with the Bi Mansion Star Lord right before him, Qin Sang didn't know how to tap into his divine power.</p><p>"I cultivate the High Divine Empyrean Scripture, corresponding to the Thunder Division deities, but I haven't obtained the relevant scriptures.  If the deity before me were from the Thunder Division, could I use the Nine Heavenly Thunder Seal within my altar to invoke a divine possession?"</p><p>As Qin Sang contemplated, the black demonic roc relentlessly assaulted the shimmering barrier outside.</p><p>The celestial mountain and Divine Hall trembled precariously.</p><p>The barrier's light gradually dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  "It seems the Twenty-Eight Mansion Star Lords aren't high-ranking enough to withstand a Demon King. Within the Western Seven Mansions, above the Mansion Star Lords is the White Tiger God, one of the Four Symbols…"</p><p>Remaining in the Western Seven Mansions left him with fewer and fewer options.  The black demonic roc, growing more adept at breaching Divine Halls, posed an escalating threat. If the White Tiger God's hall couldn't withstand it, Qin Sang's situation would become dire.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Jolted by the tremors, Qin Sang saw the situation outside and his expression shifted.  He immediately roused the golden dragon, initiating translocation.</p><p>He couldn't wait for the roc to breach the hall.  With Daoist cultivators summoning deities in the lower realm, the destruction of deity statues would weaken spells related to the Bi Mansion Star Lord and diminish the cultivators' strength.</p><p>It might even impact the war, delaying the arrival of powerful reinforcements from the Divine Court.</p><p>Golden light vanished from the hall.</p><p>The black demonic roc, sensing something, immediately locked onto the translocated Taiyi Star Chariot and pursued in a whirlwind of demonic wind.</p><p>"The Purple Forbidden Enclosure…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the Three Enclosures as he fled.</p><p>The Three Enclosures formed the core of the celestial sphere, holding the highest-ranking deities according to Daoist scriptures.</p><p>Deities like the Five Dipper Star Lords, the Nine Luminary Star Lords, and even the legendary Emperor resided there.</p><p>There, he would find more Divine Halls for refuge.</p><p>Ordinary celestial deities' halls were also denser there.  The Big Dipper region within the Purple Forbidden Enclosure alone housed not only the Seven Yuan Star Lords corresponding to the seven stars of the Big Dipper and the Left and Right Attendants, but also the Thirty-Six Heavenly Stem Stars and the Seventy-Two Earthly Branch Stars.</p><p>Within the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the nearest high-ranking deity was likely one of the Five Dippers of the Western Dipper, comprising four palaces: the White Mark Star Lord in the first palace, the High Yuan Star Lord in the second, the Imperial Spirit Star Lord in the third, and the Mighty Power Star Lord in the fourth.</p><p>These four Star Lords undoubtedly surpassed the Twenty-Eight Mansion Star Lords in rank.</p><p>However, the demons that had entered the Divine Court had all gone towards the Three Enclosures. Fleeing there might lead to being surrounded, increasing the danger.</p><p>"Where are the Thunder Division deities?"  Qin Sang wondered, looking up at the layers of celestial clouds above the Three Enclosures.</p><p>"Could the Thunder Division be there?"</p><p>The Thunder Division deities were likely no fewer than those of the Dipper Division, possibly occupying another region within the Divine Court.</p><p>One glance extinguished Qin Sang's thought of heading to the Thunder Division.</p><p>Streaks of demonic qi surged into the Three Enclosures, ascending through layers of heavenly realms.</p><p>Going there now would be like walking into a trap.</p><p>Moreover, that area was clearly more severely damaged, with sparsely scattered Divine Halls.  He was better off staying within the Dipper Division.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang steered the chariot straight towards the Western Dipper!</p><p>...</p><p>Between the Three Enclosures, layers of celestial clouds formed the Nine Heavenly Skies.</p><p>The Nine Skies were the Thunder City!</p><p>At this moment, the Azure Scaled Serpent, leading a host of demon gods, relentlessly advanced towards the Divine Empyrean Palace atop Thunder City.</p><p>Upon entering Thunder City, the demon gods realized that reaching the Divine Empyrean Palace wasn't so simple.</p><p>Otherwise, the Great Sage wouldn't have personally led the charge on the Southern Heavenly Gate with the remnant map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.</p><p>Each level of heaven represented a layer of restriction.</p><p>They ascended from the first level, initially progressing smoothly. With Thunder City damaged, they exploited weaknesses in the restrictions, reaching the seventh level in one push.</p><p>Upon reaching the eighth level, they encountered trouble.</p><p>The eighth level's restrictions were also damaged, but the gaps exerted tremendous pressure, unbearable for most demon gods.</p><p>The Azure Scaled Serpent led only the demon gods of Hollow Profundity rank and above, forming a formation to force their way through. They discovered a solitary Divine Hall on the eighth level.</p><p>Familiar with the Divine Court's history, they knew this hall enshrined the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Heavenly Lord, the highest-ranking deity of the Thunder Division!</p><p>"The Thunder Ancestor hasn't been destroyed!"</p><p>The Azure Scaled Serpent's expression revealed astonishment.</p><p>The hall's doors remained closed, yet emanated a chilling aura.</p><p>The demon gods exchanged glances, avoiding the Thunder Ancestor's hall, and continued their ascent.</p><p>Breaking through the ninth level would allow them to seize the Divine Empyrean Palace, forcing the Daoists to submit!</p><p>But after searching, they found only a few potential cracks. Even with their combined strength, they couldn't break through.</p><p>The demon gods joined forces, deploying a demonic formation and launching a fierce assault, yet they still couldn't shake the ninth level's restriction.</p><p>The Azure Scaled Serpent's eyes gleamed, its serpentine head lowered, looking down through eight levels towards the Western Seven Mansions.</p><p>That roc still hadn't subdued the human and brought the Celestial Chariot.</p><p>"Waste!"</p><p>The Azure Scaled Serpent snorted, regardless of whether the chariot could help them ascend to the ninth level, it had to be brought here for a try.</p><p>It turned to a demon beside it. "Fellow Daoist Gu, let the others continue the formation, seeking a way to break the restriction. You come down with me."</p><p>With that, the Azure Scaled Serpent slithered its demonic body, returning to the eighth level.</p><p>It had chosen a golden-horned bull demon.</p><p>The bull demon, treading on shimmering light, followed closely.</p>
