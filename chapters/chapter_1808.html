<h1>Chapter 1799: The Poisonous Realm</h1><p>Cultivation experts at the Transcending Void stage are elusive.</p><p>Everyone set off with awe.</p><p>The palanquin led the way, leaving a fiery trail in the void, like a long comet's tail.</p><p>Considering Qin Sang and others, Wan Zhenren didn't push the speed to its limit.</p><p>They sped for over a thousand miles.</p><p>Finally, they observed the celestial phenomena again.</p><p>In the far east, lightning flashed, thunder roared, and a storm raged, accompanied by strange flowers blooming across the sky and golden lotuses emerging from the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was a celestial phenomenon caused by a Transcending Void expert, likely indicating their true location, but it was too far away to tell if it was the Grand Master or the black demonic peng.</p><p>The phenomenon moved east, getting farther and farther from them, quickly disappearing from their sight.</p><p>The battle between the Grand Master and the demon king was beyond their involvement, and they dared not stay to watch. They could only return south with regret.</p><p>The return journey was smooth.</p><p>The demon king was blocked by the Grand Master, and they didn't encounter the army of Guifang.</p><p>Near Jushan, the palanquin stopped. Wan Zhenren stepped out, landing before everyone, bowing and saying, "There should be no demons blocking the way ahead. Fellow Daoists, it's time to part ways. I will report your contributions in detail to the Jushan Tribunal."</p><p>"Thank you, Wan Zhenren!"</p><p>The other experts returned the courtesy.</p><p>Wan Zhenren nodded, returned to the palanquin, and greatly increased its speed, turning into a fiery rainbow that pierced the sky and departed.</p><p>Watching the rainbow disappear into the horizon, everyone continued south, directly returning to Jushan and entering the Star Island Celestial Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang landed his flying sword, bowing to Master Zhizhan and others and saying, "Fellow Daoists, I must go to the Daoist Court, so I'll be taking my leave. Until we meet again."</p><p>He had earned merit and could directly go to the Daoist Court for advancement.</p><p>Since he didn't obtain his eligibility through a formal summons, he didn't need to visit Master Zangui.</p><p>All the experts knew that Qin Sang hadn't yet been promoted to third-rank, so they understood his urgency.</p><p>Having suppressed his true energy to the Nascent Soul stage for so long, they couldn't imagine enduring it either, wanting to break free as soon as possible.</p><p>Ironically, Qin Sang, who had been restricted, had earned the most merit this time, causing everyone to lament the unpredictability of life.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang single-handedly killed a mid-stage Cave Profound demon marquis, enough to earn him advancement.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>The other experts returned the courtesy.</p><p>Master Zhizhan smiled, "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, after you've been promoted, if you don't have a place to settle, my Sword Heart Island is quite spacious, and I've always reserved a cave mansion for you."</p><p>Seeing Master Zhizhan's attempt to recruit Qin Sang, no one was surprised. Some even regretted not speaking sooner.</p><p>Through their recent experiences, they had learned that Qin Sang was not a disciple of any sect, but a true independent cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, he was a rare cultivator of both body and cultivation techniques.  After his promotion and restoration of true energy, his strength would be unmatched.</p><p>Anyone would be eager to recruit such a powerful cultivator without worrying about conflicts of interest.</p><p>"I thank Master Zhizhan for his kindness!"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, immediately accepting without giving others a chance to speak.</p><p>During this successful mission, he had received much help from Master Zhizhan, and Qin Sang naturally remembered this favor.</p><p>Master Zhizhan didn't have entanglements with major power factions, was a sword cultivator, and they could discuss the way of the sword in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, their temperaments were compatible.</p><p>These reasons were enough for Qin Sang to make his choice.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru stood beside Master Zhang, hesitant to speak, finally pressing his palms together and saying only, "Until we meet again."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Venerable Zhenru seemed to have something to say but couldn't speak openly due to others being present.</p><p>He guessed it was related to the "Seven-Teacher Buddha Seal". In this world, Daoism was dominant, so Buddhist secret techniques were certainly very rare.</p><p>If the other party wanted to trade, it wasn't impossible, it just depended on what treasures Jingtai Temple was willing to offer in exchange.</p><p>About to return to his normal life, Qin Sang should also start collecting treasures for cultivation.</p><p>Since Venerable Zhenru didn't speak, Qin Sang didn't ask, simply giving a courteous bow and bidding farewell to everyone.</p><p>Qingtan Yuanjun, Boxian Shanren, and Yunwei's siblings didn't leave either.</p><p>After Qin Sang bid farewell, Qingtan Yuanjun stepped forward, "Since you are going to the Daoist Court, we are also returning to our mountain gate.  We could travel together for mutual support. What do you think?"</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections.</p><p>Everyone split into two groups.</p><p>Qin Sang and others changed course to the west, arrived at the right pass of Star Island Celestial Lake, used a small teleportation array, changed routes multiple times, flew for several days, and entered Baishi.</p><p>Northeast of Baishi.</p><p>Donghua Jing.</p><p>Along the way, the group hardly rested, traveling tirelessly towards Jingtan.</p><p>Entering the immortal city, seeing the bustling crowds, Qin Sang stopped, bowing and saying, "I'm going to the Baishi Tribunal. What are you two planning to do?"</p><p>Along the journey, the three had talked a lot and become quite familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to receive his advancement at the North Pole Exorcism Academy and visit Master Lingxu along the way.</p><p>Qingtan Yuanjun and the others were returning to Lougu Mountain in Zhongmao, which wasn't in the same direction, so it was time for them to part ways.</p><p>"There's no need to rush. We've traveled a great distance without rest, so let's take a break and refresh ourselves."</p><p>With that, Qing Dan Yuanjun instructed Yunwei and the other disciple, "Quickly arrange the finest banquet at the best inn in this city."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Yunwei and the disciple promptly left to carry out her instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the invitation without hesitation.  He noticed a glint in Qing Dan Yuanjun's eyes, sensing a hidden purpose behind her hospitality.</p><p>The city's finest inn, Huan Xian Pavilion, was located in the heart of the city. It was reputedly owned by the Daoist Court and incredibly popular, attracting only the most distinguished clientele.</p><p>The opulent banquet was held in a sky-high pavilion, amidst clouds and mist, with celestial music filling the air—a truly ethereal experience.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun, wishing to discuss a matter privately, requested a secluded room. Once the banquet was served, she dismissed the attendants.  Yunwei and the disciple, both accomplished Yuan Ying cultivators, were relegated to guarding the door.</p><p>The feast was extravagant. Qin Sang found himself captivated by the array of delicacies and fine wines, recognizing their immense value. The drinks were almost elixirs, the dishes featured spirit fruits, and the meats were the essence of spirit beasts. Each bite was not only delicious but also replenished spiritual energy, a truly luxurious experience.  Of course, for a cultivator at his level, this was merely a pleasant indulgence.</p><p>After several rounds of drinks and courses, Qing Dan Yuanjun finally broached the subject.</p><p>"Master Qin, have you had any new insights into the strange poison affecting my disciple?"</p><p>Qin Sang's attention sharpened.  He replied, shaking his head, "I can confirm that I've never encountered this poison before, nor have I heard of anything similar."</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun nodded in disappointment, then changed her tone. "I'm sure you're curious about its origin, Master. I assumed you would ask..."</p><p>Qin Sang adopted a receptive posture, offering no denial.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun exchanged a glance with Bai Xian Shanren before beginning her tale. "This story goes back some time. Years ago, I entered the Ju Shan ritual grounds, seeking to expand my knowledge.  I stumbled upon a poisonous domain.  Our sect's records make no mention of this place; I don't know if I was the first to discover it. The grounds, while stable, are constantly shifting..."</p><p>Pausing, Qing Dan Yuanjun looked at Qin Sang, noting his impassive expression, and continued, "This poisonous domain was extremely unusual.  I pride myself on my expertise in poisons, yet I couldn't fathom its nature. This piqued my curiosity, leading me to explore it personally."</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang asked, "And what did you find, Yuanjun?  Was it a powerful poison technique left by an ancient master, or some peculiar phenomenon created by clashing energies?"</p><p>"I suspect the former,"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun replied frankly. "I did make some discoveries, but they were either incomplete or damaged. At best, they offered a slight improvement to my disciples’ abilities and understanding, benefiting the sect. However, my own strength is insufficient. I only explored the outer reaches of the domain.  So I invited Bai Xian to assist, and had our inner disciples practice a special formation to venture deeper. Unfortunately, it cost them their lives..."</p><p>Her voice faltered as she glanced at the disciples standing by the door.</p><p>"Fate is unpredictable.  Don't blame yourself, Yuanjun. Blame the malevolent forces at work," Bai Xian Shanren consoled.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood. He mused, "Yuanjun risked so much.  Does the heart of the poisonous domain hold a treasure of great significance to you and your sect?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun quickly regained her composure, shaking her head slightly. "Whether a treasure exists is mere speculation.  We must enter the domain to know for certain. Master Qin, are you interested in this poisonous domain?"</p><p>She had deliberated on the journey here, finally deciding to reveal everything to Qin Sang and invite his assistance.</p><p>First, Lougu Mountain had suffered heavy losses; its disciples were essential for the intricate formation, and they lacked the manpower to reconstruct it. They needed outside help.</p><p>Second, she wanted to avoid alerting other sects specializing in poisons. She had to seek assistance from outside the Daoist world.</p><p>Cultivators skilled in this area were rare, and those with high cultivation even rarer.</p><p>Most importantly, Qin Sang's skill in detoxification was extraordinary.  She could only suppress the strange poison, watching several disciples perish, yet Qin Sang had neutralized it.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, saying thoughtfully, "Yuanjun has invested so much in this poisonous domain. Are you willing to share its secrets with an outsider?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun answered candidly, "Your expertise in detoxification surpasses even mine."</p><p>In my humble opinion, the Daoist master's true foundation doesn't lie in these treasures. Some items are simply useless to him."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned at this.  "That strange poison, it must be hidden deep within the Poisonous Zone, right? That place is so dangerous, and I'm not even sure I'll find what I need there. Why should I risk it?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun had already planned her response. "I only need one specific item.  The rest of the treasures will be divided amongst the three of us. If you help me obtain that one item, I'll offer you something in return...a superior-grade poison cultivation technique. What do you say?"</p><p>Her tone was confident.  Knowing Qin Sang was a powerful cultivator proficient in poison arts, she knew he wouldn't refuse.</p><p>"A cultivation technique?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed clear interest.</p><p>Refining the Qilin Seed was taking an unknown amount of time.  His spiritual sense was limited, so strengthening his physical body was another way to enhance his power.</p><p>More importantly, this technique was a poison cultivation art, seemingly involving tempering the body with potent poisons.</p><p>With the Toxic Pearl in his possession, this technique could be extremely beneficial.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang had already been tempted when Qing Dan Yuanjun mentioned the Poisonous Zone. He’d long sought potent poisons to feed the Pearl; his subsequent objections were simply a tactic to extract more benefits.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>Qin Sang asked a few more questions. Qing Dan Yuanjun didn't display the technique itself but described some of its key aspects.</p><p>Her claim of it being a superior technique was no exaggeration, but it did have a significant risk.  The poison tempering process damaged the body first. If the toxins weren't neutralized promptly, they would accumulate, becoming extremely dangerous.</p><p>It was a ruthless technique, a gamble with death.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang's expertise in detoxification, she offered this.  Anyone else would likely have refused.</p><p>"Fine, I'll join you two on the next expedition!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate long before agreeing.</p><p>However, he couldn't ignore certain concerns.</p><p>"The Daoist Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom recently clashed at the Ju Mountain altar.  Things there will likely be unstable," Qin Sang worried.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang wanted to avoid getting caught in a conflict between these two major forces.</p><p>"Rest assured, after this matter, the Gui Fang Kingdom and the Daoist Court shouldn't clash again for at least a decade. We'll prepare and set off as soon as possible," Qing Dan Yuanjun explained.</p><p>Seeing Qing Dan Yuanjun's certainty, Qin Sang suspected they had discovered something, and he had missed an opportunity by avoiding the conflict.</p><p>He didn't press further, simply nodding. "In that case, I'll focus on improving and consolidating my cultivation.  Before you set off, please send a message to Hu Zhong City."</p><p>They exchanged contact methods and finalized the arrangements.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun's tone lightened.  "We'll handle the supplies needed for entering the Poisonous Zone.  It would be best if you also made some preparations."</p><p>Everyone was pleased.</p><p>They didn't linger, leaving Huan Xian Pavilion and heading to the Teleportation Hall where the small teleportation array was located.</p><p>A certain number of people were needed to activate the array.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and the others went ahead; Qin Sang waited in the Teleportation Hall, pondering the matter of the Poisonous Zone.</p><p>As it was only a preliminary agreement, Qin Sang didn't know the exact location of the Poisonous Zone, only the general area.</p><p>His agreement, besides the allure of the treasures and the technique, had another reason he couldn't reveal.</p><p>This Poisonous Zone was located deep within the altar; passing through it might open a new path, helping him find his ascension route.</p><p>Soon enough, they had enough people, and the small teleportation array activated.</p><p>After several transfers, Qin Sang returned to the Bai Shi Altar.</p><p>Leaving the Teleportation Hall, Qin Sang didn't rush to visit Master Lingxu, instead heading towards the magnificent celestial palace deep within the altar.</p><p>He had been awestruck by the sight when he first arrived.</p><p>Now, he realized it was merely a superficial display; a far grander spectacle lay hidden, unknown to most.</p><p>What was visible was comparable at most to the outer golden hall of the Ju Mountain Altar.</p><p>He quickly walked to the front of the celestial palace.</p><p>A white jade archway came into view, bearing the inscription "Bai Shi Altar" and underneath,  "North Pole Exorcism Academy."</p><p>This was the North Pole Exorcism Academy's headquarters, the place where Daoist Court True Immortals and Grand Masters resided.</p><p>To receive third-rank Daoist ordination, the ceremony had to take place at the altar; otherwise, Qin Sang wouldn't get so close to these powerful figures.</p><p>He calmed his mind, concealed his aura, and walked toward the archway.  As he approached, he heard someone call from above, "Who goes there!"</p><p>Qin Sang produced the talisman given to him by Wan Zhenren, waved it towards the sky, and said in a deep voice, "This humble cultivator is Qing Feng!"</p>
