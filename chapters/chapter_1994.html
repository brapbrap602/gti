<h1>Chapter 1985: Alliance</h1><p>Minor Grotto-Heaven!</p><p>Qin Sang was also astonished by the extravagance of the Ji Tian Sect.</p><p>According to Ghost Mother, the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands of the Great Thousand World weren't merely secret realms sealed by spirit formations; they could be Minor Thousand Worlds!</p><p>For Void Refinement cultivators like them, the allure of a Minor Thousand World wasn't overwhelming. After all, most Minor Thousand Worlds couldn't compare to the Great Thousand World and couldn't sustain a Void Refinement cultivator's cultivation.</p><p>However, for a sect, controlling a Minor Thousand World held extraordinary significance for its development.</p><p>The value of a Minor Thousand World was immeasurable. Some held abundant resources, some nurtured billions of people, some bred unique creatures, and some produced special treasures…</p><p>The Ji Tian Sect's generosity demonstrated their extreme重视 of the Panlong Ancient Formation, and their determination to acquire it.</p><p>Great rewards always attract brave souls.</p><p>Those forces who had found remnants of the ancient formation, sealed the news, and stayed behind to comprehend it themselves would likely be unable to resist the temptation.</p><p>Looking at the Panlong Heavenly Pillar in his hand, Qin Sang felt a flicker of desire.</p><p>Previously, he had considered keeping the Panlong Heavenly Pillar for himself, thoroughly comprehending it. While he couldn't restore the Panlong Ancient Formation, it would undoubtedly significantly enhance his understanding of the Dao of Formations and Restrictions. Perhaps he could even create a smaller Panlong Formation based on the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>“It might not be a complete Minor Grotto-Heaven, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The evolutionary stages of Minor Thousand Worlds varied.</p><p>Those that hadn't yet evolved myriad things, were barren, or shattered, or had been extensively plundered by the Ji Tian Sect, would be significantly less valuable.</p><p>“Daoist sees clearly,” Gu Yun Sou said. “The Ji Tian Sect has only released the news.  As for what kind of Minor Grotto-Heaven it is and how much value remains, it will only be announced at the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly. Extant Panlong Heavenly Pillars are extremely rare. If Daoist presents the Heavenly Pillar, the chances of obtaining the Minor Grotto-Heaven are high.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou felt quite envious.</p><p>Since the Ji Tian Sect was offering it as a reward, they certainly wouldn't use a desolate Minor Grotto-Heaven, only to become a laughingstock.</p><p>A Minor Grotto-Heaven, at the very least, could serve as a retreat. In times of calamity, one could hide within the Minor Thousand World and seal the Dao Beacon Gate to avoid disaster.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Panlong Heavenly Pillar had fallen into this person's hands.</p><p>This person had annihilated Patriarch Ming Hu, displaying astonishing might. He wouldn't delude himself into thinking that the other party would share it with Cloud Metropolis Heaven.</p><p>“If I had joined forces with Patriarch Ming Hu that day, would it have been better?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Gu Yun Sou's mind.</p><p>For many years, Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Valley of Fallen Souls had been entangled in grudges, often ending in compromise.</p><p>If it were Patriarch Ming Hu, he would likely have compromised in the end. The two sects would have joined forces to obtain the Minor Grotto-Heaven and then divided it.</p><p>But it was hard to say. If he had perished or been severely injured, Cloud Metropolis Heaven would have declined, just like the Valley of Fallen Souls.</p><p>Firstly, he had too many concerns. Secondly, Qin Sang's preemptive strike had deterred him from acting rashly. Now that the situation was settled, regret was too late.</p><p>Qin Sang changed the subject and asked, “When is the next Ji Tian Dharma Assembly?”</p><p>“The Ji Tian Dharma Assembly has no fixed date, only an approximate time frame. They will send someone with a Ji Tian Token ten years in advance. The Ji Tian Sect is so eager, sooner is better than later. It should be within a hundred years or so,” Gu Yun Sou pondered.</p><p>“When the time comes, Fellow Daoist must not forget this humble Daoist. Bring me along to broaden my horizons,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“It would be my honor to travel with Daoist,” Gu Yun Sou readily agreed, yet in his heart, he pondered the deeper meaning of Qin Sang’s words.</p><p>Bring him along? Did he not intend to participate in the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly in the name of Green Ram Monastery?</p><p>Qin Sang himself was a Void Refinement cultivator with a mysterious and unfathomable background.  Although the Green Ram Monastery lacked profound heritage, obtaining a Ji Tian Token shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Could his previous guess be correct? Did this person truly have some secret he didn't want to reveal to the Ji Tian Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang indeed didn't want to push the Green Ram Monastery into the spotlight.</p><p>An unknown individual, an obscure sect, suddenly appearing and directly obtaining a Ji Tian Token and presenting a Panlong Heavenly Pillar, was too conspicuous, too eye-catching, and would easily attract unwanted attention.</p><p>If someone discovered the secret of the Thunder Altar, who knew what kind of storm it would create?</p><p>Apart from him, the four Nascent Soul cultivators of the Green Ram Monastery, none of whom were in the late stage, were far from comparable to other forces.</p><p>His disciples were only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Once he left, the Green Ram Monastery wouldn't even have someone capable of presiding over the main altar.</p><p>The Green Ram Monastery should have grown gradually. Qin Sang’s ruthless actions for the sake of his Dao comprehension had propelled the Green Ram Monastery to a status rivaling Cloud Metropolis Heaven.</p><p>Qin Sang had founded the Green Ram Monastery with the initial intention of leaving behind a lineage in the Great Thousand World. Now, he wouldn't be bound by the Green Ram Monastery, confined to a single corner.</p><p>This Ji Tian Dharma Assembly was an opportunity to gather information about the outside world.</p><p>When the time was ripe, he would definitely leave.</p><p>After he left, how could the Green Ram Monastery maintain itself and not be seen as easy prey?</p><p>An alliance between the Green Ram Monastery and Cloud Metropolis Heaven, securing a firm foothold in this region, would alleviate his worries.</p><p>He needed both an alliance between Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Green Ram Monastery and for Cloud Metropolis Heaven to have reservations, not daring to treat the Green Ram Monastery as a vassal, casually manipulating it.</p><p>The background he had crafted made Gu Yun Sou apprehensive, but to make both sides advance and retreat together, shared interests were the most stable foundation of an alliance.</p><p>The Panlong Heavenly Pillar was the best bargaining chip.</p><p>Qin Sang said meaningfully, “At the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly, I'll trouble Fellow Daoist to help me acquire the Minor Grotto-Heaven. I hope Fellow Daoist won't refuse.”</p><p>He truly couldn't spare any more energy.</p><p>Qin Sang had already made his decision to present the Panlong Heavenly Pillar to the Ji Tian Sect, and moreover, to present the treasure through Gu Yun Sou!</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was taken aback, his expression serious as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “This humble Daoist has been in secluded cultivation for many years, rarely venturing out, and has no outside connections. To obtain the Minor Grotto-Heaven, I'll need Fellow Daoist to put in a great deal of effort at the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly.”</p><p>A Minor Grotto-Heaven, with countless eyes on it, even presenting the Panlong Heavenly Pillar wouldn't guarantee success.</p><p>Moreover, after obtaining the Minor Grotto-Heaven, one needed the strength to hold onto it.</p><p>If the Dao Beacon was sufficiently concealed, it would be fine. But if the Dao Beacon of the Minor Grotto-Heaven were leaked and targeted by malicious individuals, the Green Ram Monastery wouldn't have the ability to defend it.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's heart pounded.</p><p>If he assisted the Green Ram Monastery in acquiring the Minor Grotto-Heaven, how could the Green Ram Monastery not share it with Cloud Metropolis Heaven?</p><p>Even if they only received a small portion of the Minor Grotto-Heaven, any sect would be hard-pressed to refuse.</p><p>His only concern was whether this Daoist Qing Feng had some ulterior motive, something detrimental to the Ji Tian Sect. If they formed an alliance with the Green Ram Monastery, Cloud Metropolis Heaven wouldn't be able to absolve itself of involvement.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware of Gu Yun Sou's concerns. His gaze was distant, penetrating the valleys and reaching beyond the heavens, "This humble Daoist has cultivated diligently for many years, finally reaching the Void Refinement realm and breaking free from the shackles of lifespan. I have long heard that the Great Thousand World is vast and boundless. If I cannot travel and witness its myriad landscapes, wouldn't it be a great regret?"</p><p>These words were half-truth and half-false.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't restless. As long as he could achieve immortality, being confined to one place wouldn't matter.</p><p>However, he was entangled in too much karma. He had to find the Sword Pavilion and couldn't stay in one place forever.</p><p>More importantly, the Greater Completion Slaughter Path was the Dao of the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*, the Dao of the Purple Star Sword Sovereign, but not necessarily his Dao.</p><p>Traveling the Great Thousand World, witnessing all kinds of Daos, and finding his own Dao in his travels was better than sitting idly in a cave dwelling.</p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Yun Sou's expression shifted slightly. His suspicions weren't entirely dispelled, but they had lessened considerably.</p><p>No wonder he couldn't find any information about this Daoist Qing Feng's origins. It was as if he had sprung from a crack in a stone.</p><p>This person most likely left his sect and traveled here, gaining some enlightenment of the Dao that needed validation.</p><p>He happened to encounter the conflict between Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Valley of Fallen Souls and used it to prove his Dao.</p><p>It wasn't as full of schemes and intrigues as he had imagined.</p><p>This situation wasn't uncommon, especially for cultivators who had just entered Void Refinement. Stepping into a new realm, with the path ahead shrouded in mist, the best choice was to travel.</p><p>This was something Gu Yun Sou had experienced personally.</p><p>He cultivated the core techniques of Cloud Metropolis Heaven, a lineage with an orderly inheritance, and after breaking through to Void Refinement, he still traveled for a period.</p><p>This deduction was quite logical.</p><p>Listening to Daoist Qing Feng, he wouldn't stay here for long and would continue to travel. Yet, he couldn't abandon his place of enlightenment, so drawing him and Cloud Metropolis Heaven into protecting the Green Ram Monastery became a natural course of action.</p><p>Of course, even if this Daoist Qing Feng left, Gu Yun Sou wouldn't underestimate the Green Ram Monastery.</p><p>Leaving aside Daoist Qing Feng's mysterious background, his own strength was also worth Gu Yun Sou's full effort to befriend.</p><p>Having thought through these key points, Gu Yun Sou truly began to weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>The two powers became closer.</p><p>However, without Qing Feng, it wouldn't be easy for the Green Ram Monastery to become a significant force, posing no threat to Cloud Metropolis Heaven.</p><p>He said, half in agreement, half in感叹, “So that’s how it is! This old man wishes you a smooth journey ahead.  It’s a pity this old man can't abandon his sect and travel with Daoist. When Daoist returns, if this old man is still alive, I will listen to Daoist recount the scenery along the way, to satisfy my lifelong wish!”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is so quick to issue an eviction notice. This humble Daoist will still be your neighbor for a while, perhaps for several hundred years.”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily.</p><p>Body Refinement, Sword Formation, and Thunder Arts, he needed to achieve a breakthrough in at least one of these to protect himself before he would consider leaving.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou smiled, “When the dust settles here, if Daoist has time, you might consider visiting the Fire Domain. We can join forces to excavate all the remaining ruins. Afterward, this old man will go out to gather information and visit a few fellow Daoists to prepare for the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, “This humble Daoist should accompany Fellow Daoist, however, I've just gained some insights and need to enter secluded cultivation to consolidate them. I plan to emerge from seclusion when the Ji Tian Dharma Assembly approaches.”</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou nodded. “Daoist's cultivation surely requires external resources. This old man can inquire about them along the way.”</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang, by offering the Minor Grotto-Heaven, certainly had other requests. He might as well take the initiative and let Qin Sang state his conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hold back, taking out a jade slip.</p><p>“These spirit herbs and materials are secondary. This Azure Origin Frost Essence, I hope Fellow Daoist will put some extra effort into finding.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou extended his divine sense into the jade slip. He had prepared himself for Qin Sang to make exorbitant demands. Seeing the long list, his eyelids couldn't help but twitch.</p><p>Azure Origin Frost Essence was a miraculous medicine recorded in the *Scripture of Panhu*, capable of assisting natal Gu insects in breaking through to the sixth transformation.</p><p>Previously, when Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation hadn't reached the required level, Qin Sang hadn't rushed to gather the spirit herbs. But now, with Tianmu Butterfly at the peak of the fifth transformation, it only needed to perfect its cultivation before attempting a breakthrough.</p><p>The other spirit herbs were also carefully selected by Qin Sang, greatly beneficial to body refinement, preparing him for the assault on the sixth level of the *Demonic Physique Refinement*.</p><p>With a breakthrough in strength, he also needed to upgrade his treasures. Previously, he had focused on refining the Grey Warbler Sword. The might of Ming Shan Armor and other items couldn't match a Void Refinement cultivator. Only by elevating them into true spiritual treasures could his strength reach its peak.</p><p>These were valuable items, even Void Refinement cultivators would need to put in some effort to collect them.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist needn't be so impatient. The Ji Tian Dharma Assembly is the best opportunity for fellow Daoists to exchange information and trade. There are bound to be some trade fairs, and various spiritual objects will surely appear.”</p><p>Seeing Gu Yun Sou nod, Qin Sang smiled, “This humble Daoist also wishes to participate. I hope Fellow Daoist can provide an introduction.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou nodded heavily.</p><p>He understood Qin Sang's meaning. These were just for him to prepare in advance.</p><p>As for the final transaction, it would depend on confirming the value of the Minor Grotto-Heaven and its division between them.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Heaven would definitely be fleeced. However, in the long run, it would be worthwhile.</p><p>The two conversed for a while longer. Gu Yun Sou and Qin Sang agreed on a time to visit the Fire Domain together, then he rose and took his leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the air, surveying the silent Valley of Fallen Souls.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Heaven cultivators had withdrawn.</p><p>The corpse demons of the Valley of Fallen Souls had been either killed or captured. The once formidable power that had shaken the Twilight Mountains and rivaled Cloud Metropolis Heaven had vanished into thin air.</p><p>Several streaks of light flew towards him. Seeing Qin Sang, they all stepped forward to pay their respects.</p><p>The newcomers were the two Demon Marquises, with Jing Cang sandwiched between them.</p><p>Marquis Gui stepped forward, presenting a round mirror.  Infusing it with true essence, the mirror projected a beam of light that dispersed in the void, revealing a topographical map encompassing the entire Twilight Mountains.</p><p>On the topographical map were numerous bright spots, each representing a secret realm, medicinal garden, or similar location.</p><p>Over the past few days, the two Demon Marquises had taken Jing Cang with them to meticulously inventory everything.</p><p>The accumulation of several generations of the Valley of Fallen Souls was beyond imagination. The Green Ram Monastery inheriting the legacy of the Valley of Fallen Souls would have a smooth path ahead, requiring no further effort from Qin Sang.</p><p>“Where is Ling Shi?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked.</p><p>Marquis Gui sent out a transmission talisman.  Not long after, Ling Shi arrived.</p><p>“Senior, what are your instructions?” Ling Shi bowed respectfully.</p><p>“What are your plans for the future?” Qin Sang wouldn't restrict Ling Shi's freedom. When he no longer needed him to refine virulent poisons, he could come and go as he pleased.</p><p>Ling Shi hesitated for a moment before saying, “This junior wishes to join the Green Ram Monastery. I hope Senior will grant permission.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised. He nodded and said, “From now on, you will preside over this place. Inform the cultivators of the Twilight Mountains that as long as they behave themselves and don't disturb the mortal world, this humble Daoist won't bother with them.”</p><p>“As you command!” Ling Shi bowed in response.</p><p>“You may all leave now.”</p><p>Qin Sang instructed, then slowly ascended.</p><p>The spiritual energy of the Valley of Fallen Souls was naturally far superior to that of his cave dwelling in the Fire Domain. The main hall would certainly be built on the main altar, and a branch monastery could be established here.</p><p>This place was too gloomy and unsettling, not befitting the demeanor of an orthodox sect.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the ground and raised his hands.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The earth shook, and the stone walls cracked.</p><p>The cracks grew larger and larger, and just as it seemed about to collapse, it began to bulge upwards.</p><p>Then, an enormous shadow rose from the ravine.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a towering mountain grew from the ravine, supporting the former site of the Valley of Fallen Souls, soaring into the clouds.</p><p>The several Nascent Soul cultivators witnessed the scene of a Void Refinement cultivator reshaping the heavens and earth, their eyes filled with deep shock and awe.</p>
