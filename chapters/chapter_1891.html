<h1>Chapter 1882: Defending the Daoist Order!</h1><p>A Daoist priest gazed at the heavens, witnessing the ascension of Tian Yue Shangren to the moon.</p><p>Turning his gaze, the priest looked towards the Wicked Plains and the Wicked Sea in turn.  The first strike of the demonic drum resonated; he could already sense the oppressive atmosphere enveloping the realm, surrounding the Daoist Order.</p><p>At this moment, the Daoist Order had become an isolated island.</p><p>His face grave, the priest exchanged a glance with Kun Dao.  With a flicker, he appeared above the Tian Shu Academy's Commandery.</p><p>Numerous figures were flying towards the Commandery, all the chief officials and Daoist masters of Tian Shu Academy.</p><p>However, these masters could only remain on the periphery.</p><p>Earlier, within the central altar, numerous sealed golden halls—many believed to be ownerless—had opened, releasing one grand master after another, each radiating profound and immeasurable cultivation.</p><p>All were figures familiar to later generations, legendary beings from the past.</p><p>Beyond the central altar, in the Ten Directions Forest, grand masters secluded in their mountain retreats were roused by the upheaval and emerged from their quiet chambers.</p><p>…</p><p>Jing Quan Temple.</p><p>The temple was nestled deep within the mountains, shrouded in mist and clouds.</p><p>The mountain boasted a hundred spiritual springs, living up to its name, "Pure Springs."</p><p>The temple's halls and pavilions were as graceful as the surrounding environment, blending seamlessly with the forest.</p><p>Behind Jing Quan Temple, by the spiritual springs, lay a courtyard and a thatched hut, filled with the cheerful chirping of birds—a tranquil scene.</p><p>Several wooden halls stood on either side of the courtyard gate. Two pretty female Daoists, appearing to be seventeen or eighteen years old, sat cross-legged in meditation before the halls.</p><p>Suddenly, the hut's door opened, and a figure emerged—Ru Quan Zhenren.</p><p>Ru Quan Zhenren, her cultivation still at the Dong Xuan level, hadn't fully recovered. She stood in mid-air, her robes flowing, gazed towards the sky with a look of shock, and then flew towards the front of the mountain.</p><p>Ru Quan Zhenren made no attempt to conceal her movements. The two female Daoists outside were awakened.  Seeing their master emerge, they were unsure of the reason and quickly crushed the jade talismans in their hands.</p><p>Within the temple in front of the mountain, figures immediately soared into the air.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>The current master of Jing Quan Temple flew to meet her, her mouth slightly open, about to ask, when Ru Quan Zhenren said in a deep voice:</p><p>“The heavens are changing. Open the ancestral altar! Quickly summon all disciples!”</p><p>The master, not daring to delay, carried out the order. Soon, the disciples of Jing Quan Temple gathered at the Commandery, seeing Ru Quan Zhenren standing before the ancestral altar, seemingly awaiting something.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded across the dual central altars of the Daoist Order.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhong Mao Central Altar.</p><p>Many masters surrounded the Commandery in the air. Below lay the Commandery's core, the true location of the central altar!</p><p>The Daoist priest landed before the great hall, and the doors opened by themselves.</p><p>The hall's furnishings were similar to the Beiji Exorcism Academy Commandery.  It also contained a Commandery altar, but instead of the image of "Chengtian Xiaofafa Hou Tu Huangdi," the hall displayed the image of "Gou Chen Shanggong Tian Huang Dadi."</p><p>The Daoist priest bowed to the image before stepping onto the Commandery altar and sitting cross-legged.</p><p>The next moment, a ball of light leaped from the altar, twisting and turning before the priest.  Occasionally, the outline of a seal could be vaguely seen within the light.</p><p>This seal was the Zhong Mao Central Seal!</p><p>The Central Seal was not yet complete; the seal was not yet solidified, hence its current form.</p><p>The priest, somehow now holding a square seal, pressed it against the ball of light, leaving a vermilion imprint that vanished into the light.</p><p>The next moment, the entire Commandery trembled violently. The roof of the Commandery hall seemed to disappear as the Central Seal emitted a beam of green light that shot towards the heavens.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Jingtan, Dutans, and branch altars under the jurisdiction of the Tian Shu Academy, as well as the ancestral altars of various temples and sects, all felt a resonance.</p><p>“I, Zhang Hai Chan, Upper Minister of the Nine Heavens Golden Que, the Grand Minister of the Tian Shu Academy. Now, holding the seal of the Shangqing Tian Shu Academy, I command all Daoist officials and temple masters to obey this order without delay!”</p><p>“This is indeed a moment of life or death for the Daoist Order…”</p><p>The priest's voice echoed through the Commandery, transmitted throughout the land via the Zhong Mao Central Seal.</p><p>The masters outside the Commandery, and the masters and Daoists waiting at the various altars, all listened solemnly to the command of the True Monarch.</p><p>“I implore all masters, defend our Daoist Order!”</p><p>The final sentence was uttered with a sudden rise in tone, stirring the hearts and igniting the blood of all who heard it.</p><p>“We obey the order!”</p><p>Outside the Commandery, the assembled masters responded in unison.</p><p>…</p><p>Jing Quan Temple.</p><p>Ru Quan Zhenren turned to look at the disciples behind her—some familiar, some strangers.  Some possessed the same level of cultivation as the master, others had only recently entered the Dao and were of low cultivation.</p><p>Their expressions varied—some calm, some apprehensive…</p><p>“You,” Ru Quan Zhenren raised a jade finger, pointing to the master, then several others.</p><p>“You stay!”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>The master was distraught, stepping forward, but Ru Quan Zhenren stopped her with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Ru Quan Zhenren slightly raised her head, an unusual light shining in her eyes, “The Divine Court has appeared.  Someone must remain to guard the ancestral altar and await the imperial decree. Rest assured, there will be a place for you later.”</p><p>Other disciples of the Jingquan Temple, follow me out of the mountains to fight the enemy and protect the righteous path!”</p><p>Hearing his master's unwavering tone, the temple head dared not object, only standing aside, watching anxiously as Ruquan Zhenren led a group of disciples flying out of the mountains.</p><p>Streams of light flew out of Jingquan Temple, streaking across the night sky like a meteor shower, heading east.</p><p>Their target was the nearest Daoist altar to Jingquan Temple.</p><p>Smaller teleportation arrays were often located in the immortal cities under Daoist rule, with most Daoist temples built around them. This was partly due to Daoist decree, and partly because the Daoist court chose locations that were ideal for cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, anyone looking down from the sky would see the Daoist dual administrations shrouded in night, countless lights intertwining like a vast net covering the land. These lights resembled tributaries converging towards the main river.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the altar.</p><p>While many had dispersed, some remained, including two Grand Masters.  The doors of the main hall slowly closed after the True Monarch issued his decree, and then there was silence.</p><p>The two Grand Masters each selected some personnel, one heading south and the other north. They exchanged a glance across the administration office, summoned their altars, leaped onto the celestial gang, and their fellow Masters and Daoists arrayed around them, performing rituals, their formations shifting with the Grand Masters' hand gestures.  From afar, they resembled two ever-changing talismans.</p><p>Incantations echoed from within the arrays as divine talismans materialized and were launched towards various parts of the altar.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The altar trembled incessantly, with spiritual lights erupting from all directions. These lights connected in the sky, finally converging through the hands of the two Grand Masters, merging into one giant altar hovering above the altar itself.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in Baishi Administration.</p><p>…</p><p>While the Grand Masters stationed at the altar were busy, other Grand Masters, along with various Masters and Daoist troops, had already arrived at the teleportation hall in the city. The sky above the teleportation hall was filled with people, a dense, seemingly endless mass, with more streams of light constantly converging from outside the city. Even in the most perilous times for the Daoist court, there had never been such an astonishing sight.  Though seemingly chaotic, under the Daoist court's guidance, the teleportation proceeded in an orderly manner.</p><p>From the immortal cities at both ends of the dual administrations, figures constantly poured in. If this realm were considered two parts – one land and one sea – the four administrations would be located at the intersection of land and sea, occupying a portion of the land jutting outwards, arranged in a line along the coastline.  The northern region faced the ferocious beasts of the Nieyuan wilderness, while the south faced threats from the sea. Even though the beasts rarely attacked proactively, the Daoists had to be prepared for the Guifang kingdom’s striking of the Summoning Demon Drum, and had made preparations accordingly. The layout of the immortal cities at both ends of the dual administrations contained a hidden mechanism: it was designed to prepare for this very day!</p><p>The Daoist army marched towards this point in great numbers.  However, relatively few were sent to the Huangquan Pass to directly confront the Guifang kingdom, with troops instead being drawn to other fronts.</p><p>The demon saint had deployed most of its elite troops to the Saint's Mansion to prevent the Daoist True Monarch from seizing the Summoning Demon Drum. As for the demons in the Huangquan Pass, the army stationed there could handle them. They didn't need to attack; all they needed to do was maintain their formation to prevent the demons from breaking through into the Daoist heartland.</p><p>Unfortunately, under the pressure of time, the Daoist court could only manage this much.</p><p>Cultivators from the Jushan Administration also received the True Monarch's decree through the clan altar, knowing that great changes were about to occur. The Daoist court could not handle everything; they could only save themselves.  Fortunately, the demon kingdom of Jushan also needed to protect itself and did not follow the Guifang kingdom into madness. Moreover, the Daoist court was not entirely unprepared.</p><p>Mount Heming.</p><p>The Yintian Palace, sparing no effort, activated its grand formation, sending out all its experts.</p><p>Star Island Lake.</p><p>Both the Left and Right Thunder Palaces unleashed thunder, shaking the world.</p><p>…</p><p>Xun Zhenren stood alone on a mountaintop north of Baishi Administration. Behind him came rousing shouts:</p><p>“Defend our Daoism!”</p><p>“Defend our Daoism!”</p><p>…</p><p>The sounds shook the heavens.  Xun Zhenren looked north, where dark clouds from the Nieyuan wilderness pressed down, the night impossibly dark, demonic energy billowing.  He sighed softly, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, a stream of light flew from afar, landing behind Xun Zhenren, revealing a young-looking Daoist.</p><p>The young Daoist bowed respectfully, speaking rapidly: “The great formations in all cities have been activated, mutually supporting each other. All fellow Daoists have been dispatched outside the city to guide mortals into the city as much as possible, but…”</p><p>The young Daoist’s face showed reluctance as he said with difficulty: “The beast tide is approaching. If the Guifang kingdom uses everything to strike the Summoning Demon Drum, we will not be able to bring all the mortals into the immortal cities…”</p><p>“Do what we can, and leave the rest to fate,”</p><p>Xun Zhenren said calmly.  These words, though seeming cold, were born of helplessness.  The incident was sudden, and the demons had gone all-out.  The Daoist court could barely protect itself, let alone save the common people.</p><p>The young Daoist's lips moved, wanting to say something, then stopping.</p><p>Xun Zhenren noticed, frowned, and shouted, "Hemming and hawing, is there anything else to say!"</p><p>The young Daoist, his heart steeled, knelt on one knee.  "Forgive my rudeness, Your Honor, but why haven't we seen the True Lord yet?"</p><p>Xun Zhenren coldly snorted, "The True Lord cannot be lightly summoned!"</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, Xun Zhenren sensed something, abruptly raising his head. He saw two streaks of white light shoot from the Moon Palace.</p><p>Within the white light were two sword images, one south, one north, respectively striking towards the Sea of Evil and the Field of Evil.</p><p>At this moment, within the four regions, both cultivators and demon cultivators could see these two sword images, seemingly cleaving the heavens.</p><p>Xun Zhenren watched the sword image flying north.  Even with his full magical sight, he couldn't discern the sword's true form. He knew this was due to the overwhelming sword intent contained within, and couldn't help but be secretly shocked.</p><p>Though the sword image wasn't aimed at him, merely whooshing past from high above, he felt a chill of fear, his entire body prickling. He had witnessed the True Lord in action before, but he'd never felt this way.</p><p>"What cultivation level is this sword-wielding expert? Could their power surpass even the two True Lords?"</p><p>Xun Zhenren had learned of the sword-wielding expert from the True Lord, but hadn't anticipated such astonishing strength.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The sword image vanished into the Field of Evil.</p><p>In the capital of Guifang, the drums in the Great Saint's palace roared like thunder, one after another, urgently.</p><p>Deep within the Field of Evil, roars echoed continuously.  Countless monstrous figures, enveloped in demonic clouds, surged south.  The mountain peak where Xun Zhenren stood was directly in front of the vanguard of this beast tide.</p><p>Xun Zhenren's eyes shone with light, his vision piercing the demonic clouds.</p><p>Behind the beast tide, a terrifying aura rapidly approached – a demonic beast of True Lord level.</p><p>Cultivators who had participated in the battle at the Gusshan regional altar would recognize it: the beast that transformed into grey lightning.  The beast, originally lured by the demon-summoning drums and injured by a True Lord, clearly hadn't learned its lesson and was causing trouble again.</p><p>Facing a True Lord-level beast, even Xun Zhenren, whose cultivation was second only to the True Lords, found it hard to suppress his tension. He clenched his fists, watching the sword image's movements.</p><p>The sword image seemed to sense the beast's presence, subtly shifting its course, flying towards them across the sky.</p><p>As it passed overhead, its tip revealed its sharpness.  By the time it reached the demonic clouds, a ten-thousand-zhang long sword light had been left in the void.</p><p>The sword light slashed diagonally across the demonic clouds.</p><p>Where it passed, the demonic clouds dissipated, countless beasts falling lifelessly, utterly helpless.  Beast blood stained the earth.</p><p>The sword light cleaved through the beast tide, its momentum unabated, striking the center of the grey lightning.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword light carved a fissure right through the heart of the grey lightning, seemingly about to pierce it entirely.</p><p>*"Aaaaaah!"*</p><p>A piercing shriek came from within the grey lightning.</p><p>The next moment, the grey lightning solidified, breaking apart piece by piece. A beast resembling a giant pangolin tumbled from the void, screaming as it retreated, blood spraying across the sky.</p><p>Xun Zhenren's eyes widened in disbelief. A single sword image, a single strike, had wounded a True Lord-level beast.</p><p>After the strike, the roars from the Field of Evil significantly lessened.</p><p>The sword image hung in the air, its sharpness evident, the demonic clouds seemingly pausing.</p><p>Furthermore, the other sword image, flying towards the Sea of Evil, had also cut into the storm, reaping the lives of countless beasts, staining the sea red with blood.</p><p>On the surface of the sea, a beast resembling a colossal bull stamped its hooves restlessly, roaring at the sword image.</p><p>One sword halted the demonic clouds, one sword severed the storm!</p><p>Tianyue Shangren, still in his true form, stood before the South Heavenly Gate, single-handedly blocking the path of the demon Great Saints.  The Pojun Divine Sword stood in the void, its divine light radiant.</p><p>Having expended immense energy in unleashing the two sword images, Tianyue Shangren's face was pale. He didn't move the Pojun Divine Sword again, instead summoning his own life-bound spirit sword.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The sword transformed into thousands, all pointing towards the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>He would, with his own strength, defend the Daoist sect!</p><p>…</p><p>Tianxu Academy, Office of Celestial Mandate.</p><p>Zhang Zhenjun sat cross-legged on the altar of the Office of Celestial Mandate, his gaze penetrating the hall, pausing for a moment on Tianyue Shangren, then continuing upward.</p><p>He pierced through the divine court and looked beyond the nine heavens.</p><p>Deep in the stars, strange ripples arose. The Milky Way was shrouded in shadow, the starlight unsteady, as if the heavens were about to shatter.</p><p>He closed his eyes, his hands clasped around the Zhongmao regional seal.</p><p>The next moment, wind and thunder raged around the altar. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth transformed into a spiritual tide, frantically pouring into the hall of the Office of Celestial Mandate. </p>
