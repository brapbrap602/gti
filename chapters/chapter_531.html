<h1>Chapter 524: Contact</h1><p>Repeated attempts at the Gangsha Chongdan technique yielded results consistent with his previous refinement of the Flying Night Rakshasa and Wu Shang's notes.  Although the Gangsha Chongdan hadn't yet succeeded, Qin Sang was certain the secret technique was viable!</p><p>The reason for repeated failures was the insufficient quantity of Qingyang Divine Gang!</p><p>Even if Shi Ying gave Qin Sang all the Qingyang Divine Gang she retrieved each time, it wouldn't be enough for the Gangsha Chongdan.</p><p>Moreover, Shi Ying couldn't enter the mountain frequently, and Qin Sang couldn't wait indefinitely.</p><p>Firstly, the corpse energy couldn't be suppressed indefinitely. Secondly, Qin Sang discovered the Gangsha combination was highly unstable; he suspected the technique couldn't be interrupted once begun.</p><p>It seemed he had to infiltrate Divine Gang Peak himself.</p><p>The restriction he'd placed within Shi Ying's body would automatically dissolve once he was a certain distance from the Qingyang Demon Sect, allowing her to awaken.</p><p>While Qin Sang was at the Qingyang Demon Sect, Shi Ying would remain asleep in her cave dwelling.</p><p>She had no friends, and Qin Sang would seal the cave dwelling's restriction, giving the impression of seclusion, preventing anyone from discovering Shi Ying's unusual state.</p><p>Shi Ying lay on the bed, the grayness in her brow fading, sleeping soundly like an infant, oblivious to everything.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, opening Shi Ying's pouch. He took out the Qingfu coins, the Xuantian Thunder, and the Shao Yin magnetic bottles. He left the rest, considering it compensation for Shi Ying.</p><p>Furthermore, those magical artifacts couldn't be brought to Divine Gang Peak. He needed to focus on the secret technique; he couldn't spare the effort to protect the artifacts. Only the Xuantian Thunder, being a treasure-grade artifact, could withstand the chaotic energy on Divine Gang Peak.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang gently crushed the Qingfu coin.</p><p>The coin shattered, then suddenly flashed, flowing like liquid in Qin Sang's palm, transforming into a drop of insect blood.  A phantom of a young Qingfu insect appeared on the blood.</p><p>The phantom let out an almost inaudible shriek, then with a ‘boom’, shattered completely along with the coin's remnants, dissolving into stardust.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Youzi, possessing the mother Qingfu coin, had entered the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was signaling Yun Youzi to act.</p><p>Most Qingyang Demon Sect disciples cultivate the Qingyang Demon Fire technique.  Unlike the Foundation Establishment cultivators and Shi Ying, they possessed some resistance to the chaotic energy of Divine Gang Peak; stronger cultivators would choose to practice there, constantly absorbing the Qingyang Divine Gang.</p><p>Especially the Nascent Soul realm experts of the Qingyang Demon Sect—they could remain on Divine Gang Peak indefinitely without being affected.</p><p>There were numerous experts on Divine Gang Peak now.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted Yun Youzi to create a disturbance; the bigger the better. Ideally, he wanted to draw all the late Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul realm experts to the Boundless Valley.</p><p>This would allow him to sneak into the mountain under the cover of chaos, minimizing the chance of being discovered.</p><p>As for the elusive Golden Core expert, Qin Sang didn't think he could draw him away.</p><p>Yun Youzi was right. Those who cultivated to the Golden Core stage were all cunning and shrewd.  With the Qingyang Demon Sect's experts away, the sect was vulnerable, but that person wouldn't readily leave.</p><p>Overdoing it might alert him, resulting in counterproductive effects.</p><p>Qin Sang trusted Yun Youzi's judgment.</p><p>He was prepared to steal the Qingyang Divine Gang under the Golden Core cultivator's nose. This required precise execution of the secret technique—no mistakes allowed—and a gradual, not hasty, approach.</p><p>After crushing the Qingfu coin, all that remained was waiting for news.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the Xuantian Thunder and Shao Yin magnetic bottles in his bosom, glanced at the sleeping Shi Ying, then activated the soul mark of Shi Ying in his primordial spirit, opening the cave dwelling's restriction.</p><p>Concealing his figure, he left the cave dwelling, restoring the restriction. He turned to gaze at the vast inner area of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Among the mountains, he occasionally saw Qingyang Demon Sect disciples flying on their magical artifacts, mostly Qi Condensation disciples, traveling between Divine Gang Peak and their cave dwellings.</p><p>Qin Sang had exceptional qi-concealment techniques.  Within the Qingyang Demon Sect, only the Golden Core cultivator might detect him; he was confident he could evade the perception of other Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Unless his luck was exceptionally bad, he was unlikely to be discovered.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his foot, disappearing into the dark crevices between the rocks, silently leaving the cliff and descending into the forest at the foot of the mountain, moving discreetly through the woods.</p><p>Oddly, he wasn't heading towards Divine Gang Peak, but in the opposite direction, towards the outer perimeter of the inner sect.</p><p>After crossing more than ten mountains, Qin Sang's figure appeared on the bank of a river valley.</p><p>Ancient trees towered on either side of the valley. Qin Sang, hidden in the shade of a tree, looked towards the valley's end.  At the valley's mouth stood two massive boulders, one on each side, jutting out from the mountain as if guarding the entrance.</p><p>An elderly man in grey robes sat upon the left boulder. His hair was white, his body frail, yet he possessed the cultivation of a late Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. He was a steward of the Qingyang Demon Sect, advanced in years with little hope of further cultivation.  His current duty was overseeing the patrols of the sect's guards.</p><p>Anyone entering or leaving the inner sect had to pass by the old man or his patrols.  At intervals, a group of patrolling disciples would fly in from the distance, briefly salute the old man before departing.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the time, observed the old man, then slipped into the forest, finding a hidden spot to conceal himself. His figure blended perfectly with the shadows as he waited patiently.</p><p>A day and a night passed swiftly.  Aside from the disciples entering the inner sect and the patrolling guards, nothing unusual occurred. Qin Sang patiently waited another full day. Still, nothing.</p><p>On the third morning, a cold wind woke him from his meditative state.  Seeing the Qingyang Demon Sect operating as usual, Qin Sang frowned. If he waited too long, he risked losing control of the corpse energy. If something happened to Yun Youzi, he would have to risk entering the Divine Firmament Peak.</p><p>“Four days left…”</p><p>Qin Sang checked his physical condition, calculating his time limit.  If he couldn't draw away the sect's experts, he might have to secretly absorb the Divine Firmament Qi at the foot of the mountain, but he wasn't sure of its purity there.</p><p>While pondering this, he suddenly heard a sharp whistling sound from the valley's end.  Qin Sang's expression changed, he stood up, silently emerged from the shadows, and watched the valley.  A streak of fire was rapidly approaching.</p><p>“Halt! Who’s there!”</p><p>The old man on the boulder abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp, as he shouted.</p><p>“Senior Brother Chai, it’s me!”</p><p>The light instantly reached the old man.  The fire dissipated, revealing a square-faced middle-aged man, his face filled with panic.</p>
