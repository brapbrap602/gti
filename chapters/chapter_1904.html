<h1>Chapter 1895: Sword Domain</h1><p>A celestial omen appeared!</p><p>Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi blinked and formed a spiritual tide, vast and mighty. The distant Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi was also affected, giving birth to countless spiritual light clusters that collided in all directions, then were swallowed by the spiritual tide, forming an even more immense tidal surge.</p><p>This piece of heaven and earth was stirred by Qin Sang.</p><p>It looked similar to the celestial phenomenon when Qin Sang broke through to Nascent Soul, but both the momentum and scale were incomparable to that time.</p><p>The beautiful scenery of myriad rays of rosy clouds was fleeting.</p><p>Wind and thunder intertwined, completely breaking the silence of the Divine Court. Dark clouds rolled, and clusters of illusory flames appeared from nowhere, boundless and filling the void.</p><p>Yin Fire arrived!</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation descended.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang was prepared, he was still caught off guard as the intense poison corroding his body was suddenly compounded by the Yin Fire burning him, his expression contorting.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Gusts of Yin Wind blew, the clouds shifted unpredictably.</p><p>The Yin Fire stretched endlessly. Qin Sang, at the center of the sea of fire, immediately felt the burning pain.</p><p>This feeling was very familiar. It wasn't Qin Sang's first time experiencing it, but this time was undoubtedly the most dangerous.</p><p>In the past, the Yin Fire Tribulation was the weakest of the Three Disasters. With his powerful physical body, overcoming this tribulation wasn't difficult.</p><p>Now, he had no preparation and had to resist the snake venom within his body simultaneously.</p><p>However, having successfully broken through to Void Refinement, Qin Sang had transformed once more, and the accumulated snake venom wasn't as troublesome.</p><p>He didn't hesitate, forcing out the remaining Demonic Core power within his body, then performing a series of hand seals.</p><p>The Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele manifested simultaneously, transforming into a Vajra Glazed Body and merging with a Spiritwood Body.</p><p>Qin Sang's skin became rough, resembling a tree spirit, his appearance bizarre, but with golden light flowing through his body, adding a touch of Buddhist holiness.</p><p>The effects of the two secret arts were immediate, and Qin Sang's expression eased.</p><p>In this short time, the Yin Fire had already burned from the Yongquan acupoint to the Niwan Palace, his five viscera and six bowels all suffering from the burning, the pain excruciating.</p><p>Resisting the Yin Fire with the power of these two secret arts.</p><p>Qin Sang endured the intense pain and, incredibly, amidst the Heavenly Tribulation, diverted his attention to deal with the snake venom within his body first.</p><p>The previously accumulated snake venom was forced out, condensing into a venomous pearl in Qin Sang's palm before dispersing with a bang.</p><p>In his haste, Qin Sang naturally couldn't eliminate all the snake venom, but it greatly alleviated his condition, allowing him to focus on the Yin Fire Tribulation.</p><p>Yin Fire can temper the body.</p><p>Qin Sang obviously didn't dare entertain such a thought. Being able to break through to Void Refinement and survive the Heavenly Tribulation was already a stroke of luck!</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Smoke emanated from Qin Sang's nose and mouth. His eyes and ears continuously emitted flames. Flesh, organs, bone marrow—the Yin Fire was everywhere.</p><p>The intense pain made his whole body tremble. The Yin Fire was like a bone-scraping steel knife, tearing him apart and grinding him to pieces.</p><p>However, Qin Sang cultivated body refinement as well and possessed two superior secret arts, something many cultivators of the same rank couldn't match.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang's mind relaxed slightly. At least he wouldn't perish in the Yin Fire Tribulation!</p><p>Waves of pain assaulted Qin Sang's nearly numb mind, as if he had been torn apart and reassembled multiple times. Finally, the Yin Fire showed signs of weakening.</p><p>Having survived the Yin Fire Tribulation, equivalent to overcoming the greatest hurdle of the Three Disasters, Qin Sang was confident about the next two.</p><p>The process of overcoming the tribulation was also a process of gradually becoming stronger. The feeling was different now. Qin Sang seized the time and forced out more snake venom. The venom posed no threat to him anymore.</p><p>The Gale followed the Yin Fire.</p><p>In fact, if Qin Sang sealed the Jade Buddha, the Gale wouldn't be able to invade his Nascent Soul, and he could easily overcome this tribulation.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't do so. If the Dao Court was indeed watching him, it would expose the Jade Buddha's existence. The Thunder Ancestor's power breaking through the Jade Buddha's weakness, to some extent, also prevented the Jade Buddha from being exposed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how effective this would be, but he had to do it.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang would still use the Jade Buddha to weaken the Gale Tribulation’s power.</p><p>Similarly, for the upcoming Heavenly Thunder Tribulation, Qin Sang didn't plan to let the Celestial Eye Butterfly appear, lest it attract even greater calamities.</p><p>Moreover, the Celestial Eye Butterfly was only at the Fifth Transformation Mid-Stage, too weak.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Heavenly Thunder finally arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, lightning illuminating them.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the other side, where the mass of blood plasma still hadn't broken free from the heart demon.</p><p>However, the plasma's writhing became increasingly intense, occasionally forming a human silhouette, indicating that the other party was about to regain consciousness.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred slightly. The Cloud Wanderer Sword shot back, its blade turning in front of him, aiming at the descending tribulation lightning, and piercing through the air!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Sword and lightning clashed.</p><p>A sword light, majestic and imposing, pierced through the Heavenly Thunder, its momentum faintly suppressing the thunder's might.</p><p>The first Heavenly Thunder fell beneath the sword!</p><p>Besides the Cloud Wanderer Sword, Qin Sang only used the Bright Mountain Armor for protection, not summoning any other spirit treasures.</p><p>He closed his eyes again. In his mind, the scriptures of the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter and a sword light flashed alternately.</p><p>This sword light was precisely the last sword from Heavenly Voyager’s "spar" with him, leaving a deep impression on Qin Sang.</p><p>Only after stepping into Void Refinement did he realize that this wasn't a simple sword strike. It contained endless profound mysteries. It was just that his realm back then was insufficient, and he only felt that the sword light was rather mystical, not comprehending it.</p><p>Heavenly Voyager truly imparted the Dao through the sword, profound meaning in concise words!</p><p>Qin Sang originally intended to use the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman and other methods, combined with swordsmanship, to break the thunder, but at this moment, he was immersed in the sword dao.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword leaped up and down, streaks of Heavenly Thunder shattering against its edge.</p><p>No matter how mighty the Heavenly Might, I will break it with a single sword!</p><p>Qin Sang finally displayed a bit of a sword cultivator's demeanor.</p><p>His sword intent became increasingly pure, actually using the thunder tribulation as an opponent to hone his swordsmanship.</p><p>Comprehending the Dao amidst the tribulation lightning, few in the world could achieve this.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that after breaking through to Void Refinement, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, the only sword formation in the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter, also underwent a mystical transformation.</p><p>The sword dao contained within the sword light, although different from the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter, had similarities. It was like a guide, helping him comprehend the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, making astonishing progress in a short time.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The tribulation lightning grew stronger, the lightning continuing to engulf the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly moved, pinching sword seals, abruptly separating into seven illusory figures, transforming into seven Sword Souls.</p><p>The seven Sword Souls surrounded Qin Sang, each like an independent entity, each performing different sword techniques.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Seven sword lights successively plunged into the lightning.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword, which was being bombarded by the Heavenly Thunder and continuously pushed down, received support, its momentum surging.</p><p>Only the sound of sword cries resonated through the heavens. The spirit sword, as if possessing the power to pierce the heavens, instantly split the Heavenly Thunder!</p><p>This wave of tribulation lightning was annihilated. The lightning within the tribulation clouds converged, seemingly stagnating due to the sword's might.</p><p>The tribulation clouds seemed to be enraged, immediately sending down even more terrifying Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>Thunder rained down.</p><p>From beginning to end, Qin Sang stood tall beneath the tribulation clouds, never yielding!</p><p>The time left for him to comprehend was ultimately too short. Qin Sang still had to use the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman, the Four-Legged Azure Snake Seal, and others, coordinating them with his swordsmanship.</p><p>Finally, the last Heavenly Thunder descended, exhausting the power of the tribulation clouds, its might overwhelming.</p><p>An astonishing sword intent erupted from within Qin Sang. The seven Sword Souls transformed into swords and flew towards the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword, converging with the seven souls, its blade trembled slightly. Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi frantically gathered, and the same strange phenomenon as when Qin Sang broke through appeared again, transforming into a dazzling giant sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen Heavenly Voyager perform this before. Back then it was illusory, now it was real!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword moved the clouds, responding to the Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>Instantly, the wind and clouds changed color. Sword Qi and lightning formed a terrifying storm above Qin Sang's head, shredding the last remnants of the tribulation clouds.</p><p>…</p><p>The storm gradually subsided.</p><p>The power of the tribulation lightning dissipated, leaving only the Cloud Wanderer Sword, quietly suspended in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang also fell silent, his eyes tightly closed, motionless, his expression constantly changing.</p><p>He was waiting for the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>As expected, the Heart Demon didn't arise.</p><p>What Qin Sang was worried about were the Outer Domain Heavenly Demons. This was also one of the greatest dangers of this breakthrough.</p><p>Since he was targeted by an Outer Domain Heavenly Demon, it was likely that the Heavenly Demon would take advantage of the tribulation to invade, or even directly descend with its true body!</p><p>If not for the urgency of the situation, Qin Sang would have resolved this hidden danger before breaking through, but now he had to risk his life.</p><p>He waited like this for a while, with no reaction.</p><p>“The Outer Domain Heavenly Demon doesn’t seem to have come…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>Not only did the Heavenly Demon targeting him not come, but there were no other Heavenly Demon auras either.</p><p>“Could it be because of that blood crystal? Was the Heavenly Demon heavily injured or killed by the blood crystal, or was it injured and, fearing the blood crystal, didn’t dare to directly descend? Could other Heavenly Demons also be deterred…”</p><p>Qin Sang speculated inwardly, never having anticipated that an enemy would resolve this hidden danger for him.</p><p>He didn't know whether this was good or bad, or if it would further enrage the Heavenly Demon, causing it to return with a vengeance in the future.</p><p>Regardless, this situation was extremely advantageous for Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>His eyes slightly opened. Qin Sang’s gaze changed from initial confusion to sharpness, fixated on the blood pool.</p><p>His gaze was like a sword, killing intent exposed!</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer Sword trembled slightly, its sword cry resounding. In an instant, it transformed into a sword light, shooting forth.</p><p>Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi was stirred once more. The spirit sword flew through the air, the spiritual tide following, vast and mighty, engulfing everything.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The sword’s sound was like thunder.</p><p>The mass of blood plasma happened to be in front of the spirit sword, already showing signs of returning to human form.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword’s shadow passed right through it.</p><p>The blood plasma offered no resistance, immediately solidifying. There seemed to be a faint, shrill scream, but no wounds were visible on the plasma.</p><p>As the spiritual tide surged forward.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The blood plasma shattered on the spot, the fragments swept away by the spiritual tide, completely vanishing.</p><p>The powerful enemy that had once driven Qin Sang to the brink of death was slain with a single sword!</p><p>After annihilating the shadowy figure, the Cloud Wanderer Sword didn't pause, pointing towards the blood pool.</p><p>By the time the Cloud Wanderer Sword arrived above the blood pool, it had transformed into a towering giant sword once more, its blade hanging upside down, poised to strike.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s seven Sword Souls appeared around the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>In an instant, the mighty spiritual tide seemed to be smoothed over by a hand.</p><p>The giant sword manifested by the Cloud Wanderer Sword also dissipated, revealing the spirit sword’s true form.</p><p>Following that, the Cloud Wanderer Sword itself gradually faded, vanishing along with the seven Sword Souls.</p><p>Silence fell around the blood pool, everything as if it had never happened, like a tranquil lake surface, without a ripple.</p><p>Within the blood pool, the two figures struggling to escape abruptly changed color.</p><p>Before, seeing Qin Sang break through amidst battle and his sword cutting down the Heavenly Thunder, their expressions hadn’t changed much, showing no signs of retreat.</p><p>Now, witnessing this bizarre scene, their expressions drastically changed, revealing a look of horror unlike any seen before.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>Void Refinement experts could create their own domains, a great divine ability.</p><p>Different Dao lineages and cultivation methods resulted in different manifestations of domains. In the vast world, people were accustomed to giving them different names based on their external appearance.</p><p>For instance, a sword cultivator’s domain was called a Sword Domain.</p><p>Clearly a cultivator who had just stepped into Void Refinement, the swordsmanship displayed, actually having a Sword Domain aura, how could the two not be shocked!</p><p>Qin Sang himself naturally couldn't have comprehended a Sword Domain.</p><p>Upon stepping into the Void Refinement realm, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation finally underwent another change, actually able to transform into a domain!</p><p>Qin Sang’s realm was still shallow. He didn’t know if the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation could evolve into a true Sword Domain at the Void Refinement stage. What he displayed was merely a superficial semblance.</p><p>Moreover, the sword light imparted by Heavenly Voyager also possessed a profound intent, guiding Qin Sang towards this level, which was why Qin Sang could execute such a sword strike immediately after breaking through!</p><p>Even if it was only a trace of Sword Domain aura, it had already surpassed the scope of a sword formation.</p><p>The two within the blood pool were greatly alarmed.</p><p>At their peak, they wouldn’t have placed Qin Sang in their eyes, but now it was different. They had forcefully intruded into the Divine Court and suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>Furthermore, being between the Divine Court barriers, they were greatly restricted and suppressed.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw this.</p><p>At the moment of his sword strike, the phoenix wings on Qin Sang’s back suddenly spread. The Azure Phoenix manifestation, accompanied by a resonant phoenix cry, detached from his body, soaring through the air.</p><p>At the same time, wind and clouds converged above Qin Sang’s head.</p><p>The True Yuan within his body surged, leaving his body and forming an illusory figure in mid-air, its appearance and aura identical to Qin Sang.</p><p>Void Refinement Dharma Body!</p><p>Manifestation and Dharma Body appeared simultaneously, both soaring towards the sky.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, golden light dazzled.</p><p>Holding nothing back, Qin Sang used both his manifestation and Dharma Body to execute the Sun Wheel Seal, its power far surpassing what it was before.</p><p>The golden sun hung high.</p><p>Within the void, golden ripples flowed as if tangible.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang roared furiously, the Sun Wheel solely illuminating the blood pool.</p><p>In an instant, the blood pool was enveloped in golden light. The golden light merged into the mud and blood, immediately causing even more violent chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang’s purpose wasn’t to kill the enemy, but to pour all the power of the Sun Wheel Seal into the blood pool.</p><p>He couldn’t shake the palm print and the Divine Court, but with all his might, he could seize the opportunity and intensify the chaos within the blood pool!</p><p>The two sensed the danger, but it was too late.</p><p>Even a slight increase in the already terrifying pressure was unbearable for them.</p><p>The blood pool was like a cage, tightly binding them. Every movement was as heavy as a thousand jun!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>They let out shrill screams.</p><p>Qin Sang remained indifferent. The two made no attempt to hide their malice towards him, so he would show no mercy!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Above the blood pool, ripples suddenly appeared in the calm void. A light and agile sword shadow materialized, gently slicing towards the blood pool.</p><p>Silent and without a trace!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The golden light dissipated.</p><p>The blood pool returned to its original state. The mud and blood still churned, but the two figures were gone.</p><p>…</p><p>“Huff… huff!”</p><p>Qin Sang gasped heavily, his eyes fixed on the blood pool.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but relax.</p><p>He was completely drained. If those two weren't dead, it would have been him!</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang thought he had escaped danger, a woman's voice suddenly sounded behind him.</p><p>“Not bad! Very good!”</p><p>Qin Sang's entire body stiffened. He slowly turned around and saw a woman in blood-red clothing, her body somewhat illusory, standing behind him at some point.</p><p>The woman looked at the Cloud Wanderer Sword, a trace of reminiscence in her eyes, her tone not concealing her admiration for Qin Sang. “I heard Tian Yue speak of your temperament, utterly different from what I imagined. However, you were able to withstand the Thunder Ancestor’s assault and use the momentum to break through. It’s clear that your will and character are no less than his back then.  It’s not surprising that you could inherit his mantle.”</p><p>Qin Sang clearly didn't recognize the woman, yet he felt a sense of familiarity from her.</p><p>When he realized the source of this familiarity, he couldn't believe it.</p><p>“You… are that Blood Moon?”</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
