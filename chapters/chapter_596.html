Chapter 589: Mid-Grade Magical Treasure


After the two Ten Yama Banners were restored, Qin Sang's strength greatly increased.
The complete formation of the Ten Yama Banners requires all ten banners. However, formations can also be arranged with three, six, or nine banners.
Among them, the simplest banner formation, arranged with three demonic banners, can unleash power comparable to a mid-grade magical treasure.
With six banners, it can contend with a high-grade magical treasure.
Nine banners form the pinnacle of high-grade magical treasures!
Late-stage Golden Core cultivators have the opportunity to elevate their natal magical treasures to the mid-grade level. Especially Yi Tiannie, as the sect leader and inheritor of Patriarch Kuiyin's legacy, has no shortage of mid-grade magical treasures.
However, high-grade magical treasures are not so easily obtained. Even some Nascent Soul cultivators do not possess them, unless they have exceptional opportunities during the Golden Core stage.
Supreme-grade magical treasures are even rarer, exceptionally scarce throughout the cultivation world.
After Patriarch Kuiyin's passing, only five Ten Yama Banners remained. If there had been one more, the outcome of the battle with the Yuanzhao Sect might have been very different.
The unique nature of the Ten Yama Banners isn't due to Patriarch Kuiyin's refining techniques, but rather the banners' inherent properties.
This brings us to the third and most crucial part of the Ten Yama Banners, the foundation of the treasure itself—the Nine Nether Demonic Fire!
Without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Ten Yama Banners are just ten ordinary flags.
Qin Sang had a premonition that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was extraordinary, possibly an external entity rather than something refined by Patriarch Kuiyin. After soul-searching, he learned this was indeed the case.
Patriarch Kuiyin discovered the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, a strange demonic flame, in the Violet Palace.
At the time, Patriarch Kuiyin, already a Nascent Soul expert, entered the Violet Palace and, upon discovering this demonic fire, attempted to probe it.  The fire immediately retaliated. Caught off guard, he was nearly incinerated and perished within.
He ultimately escaped with his life at the cost of a precious magical treasure.
After seeing the description of the true Nine Nether Demonic Fire, Qin Sang compared it mentally to the Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect. He felt that the true Nine Nether Demonic Fire was even more powerful.
One must consider that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire encountered by Patriarch Kuiyin was just a single wisp, while the Ancestral Sacred Fire occupied the peak of Divine罡 Peak. Their scales were incomparable.
Having lost a treasure and narrowly escaped death, Patriarch Kuiyin was heartbroken, yet also captivated by the terrifying power of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.
Upon discovering that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was unclaimed, Patriarch Kuiyin began to scheme. If he could control such a powerful demonic fire, his strength would instantly surge, and dominating the entire Small Cold Region would be a trivial matter.
During that trip to the Violet Palace, Patriarch Kuiyin went nowhere else, focusing solely on the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. He gradually became familiar with it, but ultimately returned empty-handed.
The true Nine Nether Demonic Fire was too terrifying and incredibly violent, beyond human control. A moment of carelessness would result in incineration.
However, Patriarch Kuiyin never gave up because he discovered a dark iron pillar standing near the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.
The dark iron pillar was broken in two. Both its material and the restrictions upon it were incredibly profound, unlike anything Patriarch Kuiyin had ever seen. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire seemed to fear this pillar, trapped by it and unable to leave the area.
The dark iron pillar was like a cage, or perhaps a seal.
Even broken and fragmented, it could still contain this wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Fire.
At this point, the Violet Palace was about to close, and he had to leave. However, a plan to subdue the demonic fire had already formed in Patriarch Kuiyin's mind.
He took the broken section of the dark iron pillar and, after meticulously studying it for over a hundred years, finally found a way to refine it.
Using the power of spirit arrays and ghostly secret arts, and adapting a demonic sect's banner formation refining method, he refined the dark iron pillar into the ten Ten Yama Banners.
Finally, on his next visit to the Violet Palace, he subdued the Nine Nether Demonic Fire!
The true Nine Nether Demonic Fire's power was too terrifying. Patriarch Kuiyin actually utilized the power of the dark iron pillar itself, using secret arts to divide it and seal portions within each of the Ten Yama Banners.
The Ten Yama Banners aren't truly demonic artifacts; they are instruments for controlling fire.
Each Ten Yama Banner contains a portion of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, inheriting only a fraction of its original power. Thus, when three, six, or ten banners are combined into a formation, their power increases accordingly.
However, even with all ten banners, they can only unleash a portion of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's true might.
Even this partial power can rival a supreme-grade magical treasure, demonstrating the immensity of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's power.
The name "Nine Nether Demonic Fire" was given by Patriarch Kuiyin himself. To this day, the Kuiyin Sect doesn't know its true name.
Despite searching ancient texts, no records of such a demonic fire could be found, and Patriarch Kuiyin never encountered a similar flame elsewhere.
Because of this, even during his lifetime, Patriarch Kuiyin couldn't restore the half-destroyed Ten Yama Banners.  Yi Tiannie and the others weren't even Nascent Soul cultivators, making finding the Nine Nether Demonic Fire impossible.
Without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, even the most skilled craftsman would be helpless.  Even though Patriarch Kuiyin later found a way to retrieve the other half of the dark iron pillar, it was useless.
Learning this, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of creating a complete set of Ten Yama Banners.
Without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, it was simply impossible. Patriarch Kuiyin had entered and exited the Violet Palace multiple times, finding only this single wisp.
Nevertheless, repairing the other two banners to a level comparable to a mid-grade magical treasure still thrilled Qin Sang.
This meant that while other cultivators of the same rank were still troubled by low-grade magical treasures, upon reaching the Golden Core stage, he would immediately possess a mid-grade one.
One must know that even among mid-stage Golden Core cultivators, possessing a mid-grade magical treasure was rare.
Coupled with the evolving Night Fiend, Qin Sang believed he could face mid-stage Golden Core opponents without fear, and crush those of the same rank!
Lost in these thoughts, Qin Sang fondly toyed with the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit.
A rich, strange fragrance wafted from it, the cloud-like threads on its surface seeming to move. It felt magical, emanating a cool sensation from his fingertips.

"Senior, you were just bluffing Yi Tiannie, weren't you? I still need to consume this fruit to restore my foundation?"

Yun Youzi nodded slightly. "Although the Three Lights Jade Liquid is unique, it's ultimately just known as a healing elixir.  I wasn't certain whether it could restore your foundation. Consuming the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit, a targeted remedy, is more reliable.  However, regardless of its effectiveness, we couldn't let him threaten us indefinitely. Fortunately, this old man still had some strength left to snatch the fruit for you."

"Senior is right…"

Qin Sang nodded in agreement. He, too, had decided to forgo the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit and eliminate Yi Tiannie, echoing Yun Youzi's thoughts. "Thank you for your assistance, Senior.  I wouldn't have achieved my goal without you. Senior, how is your current condition?"

Yun Youzi examined himself and shook his head.  "I'm afraid it will take some time for me to recover.  Once we leave the Ancient Medicine Garden, I'm afraid you'll have to break the restrictions alone, Qin Sang."
