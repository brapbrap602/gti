<h1>Chapter 1626:  Divine Transformation Companions</h1><p>Chapter 1626:  Divine Transformation Companions</p><p>Beyond the cloud wall.</p><p>Cultivators at the Yuan Ying stage, having received news, gradually arrived.  Gazing at the cloud wall, the cultivators were eager to try their luck, but the expanding wall forced them to retreat repeatedly.  Few dared to risk their lives and had the strength to break through.</p><p>The scene within the ice wall was chaotic, with hidden currents surging; it was too dangerous!</p><p>“Old Qiu, what do we do?  If we keep waiting, the best treasures in the secret realm will be completely looted…”  Qiao Shan Patriarch said anxiously.</p><p>They had gathered their allies and traversed the turbulent currents together, never expecting to encounter this roadblock.  Although the inside of the cloud wall was extremely chaotic, he estimated that as long as a Yuan Ying cultivator was cautious enough, they shouldn't easily die inside.  However, Old Qiu stubbornly refused to take the risk.  He himself was alone and felt it was not safe, so he was also stuck outside.</p><p>Old Qiu said calmly, “Some suspect this secret realm is the abandoned estate of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. I think it's almost certainly true.  Who do you think would have the ability to open the estate?  Even if you could get in, do you have the strength to compete with them for the best treasures? Those few who went in haven't made a move yet. Let's wait a little longer.”</p><p>“Those people's cultivation is not inferior to ours. If they are all forced out, we can only wait for the cloud wall to dissipate…” Qiao Shan Patriarch sighed.</p><p>The cloud and the turbulent currents mingled together. Some cultivators outside the cloud wall gathered in small groups, inviting familiar faces to join forces; others stayed alone in the distance, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Some entered the cloud wall in pairs.</p><p>Soon, people continuously retreated from the cloud wall, looking quite dishevelled, some even injured, making others even more hesitant to act.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>The cloud wall showed no sign of weakening; instead, it became even more violent and dangerous.</p><p>In a hidden location outside the crowd, several figures stood.</p><p>All were monks and nuns, dressed in simple robes, without makeup. Some wore monk's hats, having fully shaved their heads; others were nuns with hair, wearing elegant headdresses.</p><p>They had arrived not long ago and were observing. The leading nun had a faint divine light between her brows, displaying a bright jade pendant, like an opened third eye. The jade reflected the cloud wall, and scenes from within it flickered frequently, seemingly peering inside – quite mysterious.</p><p>Suddenly, the jade disappeared into the nun's brow.</p><p>The nun said gravely, "The collapse of the Guardian Cloud Dragon shouldn't have caused such violent chaos.  Internal turmoil within the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, and the self-activation of the grand formation, combined with other factors, resulted in this mutation.  Before the cloud wall shows signs of weakening, entering from here will not be easy."</p><p>“Is it really the legendary Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?” a young nun exclaimed excitedly. “Didn’t our teacher say that our Yan Yue Monastery has deep ties with the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?  Is there no way to get through the cloud wall?  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect controls the legendary Immortal Palace, excavating countless treasures. Even if we can't get into the palace, obtaining treasures from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect would be a great opportunity!”</p><p>All the nuns looked at the older nun.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the older nun hesitated, then turned and flew towards the outside passage.  The others, puzzled, quickly followed.</p><p>While flying, the older nun looked at a nun beside her, saying, “Little Sister, I didn't tell you this when I accepted you as a disciple, because the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect no longer exists, it was meaningless.  Furthermore, the cultivation world has hunted down the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  Although we are a secluded sect, we don't want to reveal our connection to them and attract trouble.  But the reappearance of the abandoned estate shows that the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's legacy hasn't been completely severed.”</p><p>Although the nun was dressed simply in plain robes and with a bare face, her stunning beauty was undeniable.  She nodded, clearly a woman of few words.</p><p>A middle-aged nun with hair chimed in, "Not only Sister Liuli didn't know, but none of us were aware. We are Buddhist cultivators. How are we connected to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?”</p><p>“In the Central Plains cultivation world, especially the Southern Barbarian provinces, which sect dares to say they have absolutely no connection to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, tracing back to its origins?” the older nun said with a sigh.  “The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, following the common division of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, established five palaces. But the inheritance wasn't limited to these five lineages; it was diverse.  It just wasn't established as separate lineages, all categorized under the five palaces.  And that's just inside the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  In the past, countless forces relied on the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, including many demonic and Buddhist forces.  The Gan Lu Chan Yuan and the Eight Scenic Views also had significant ties with the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.”</p><p>The others heard these secrets for the first time.</p><p>“Did our Yan Yue Temple ever have ties to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect?”</p><p>The old nun nodded.  “Yan Yue Temple and the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect have a deeper connection than most. Our founding abbess was the Dao companion of a Nascent Soul Elder from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.”</p><p>“A Nascent Soul Dao companion!”</p><p>The young nun gasped.  “Why did the abbess become a nun?”</p><p>“After reaching Nascent Soul, there's a chance of ascension, but the path to ascension is perilous. Even Nascent Soul cultivators face life-threatening dangers; ascending while still alive is only a legend.  Our abbess repeatedly failed to achieve ascension. Her Dao companion was unwilling to go alone, but the abbess didn't want to be an obstacle to her companion's immortal path, so she forced her companion to leave, even threatening to kill herself.  Her Dao companion promised to return for her once they reached a high level of cultivation, but both knew that this parting meant a separation across realms, with no hope of reunion. After her Dao companion left, the abbess, unable to bear the pain of longing, and unwilling to face the memories of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, retreated into Buddhist practice, founding Yan Yue Temple, and spending her days with only a lamp and Buddha statue…”</p><p>The old nun spoke slowly, her tone even, but everyone could feel the profound love between the abbess and her Dao companion.</p><p>There's no perfect solution in this world.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators face helplessness and despair.</p><p>Those who enter Yan Yue Temple practice Buddhism, and the first thing they must do is to cultivate a mind free of desires – no wonder the sect has so many practices related to this.</p><p>It turned out that the abbess, having experienced the pains of love and longing, turned to Buddhism, unwilling to let future generations repeat her mistakes.</p><p>“Did the abbess’s Dao companion fail to keep their promise?” The young nun’s expression was somber, moved by the abbess's story.</p><p>The old nun chanted a Buddhist invocation.  “The world changes, and immortal sects rise and fall. Over countless years, surely many Nascent Soul cultivators have ascended, yet we've never heard of any returning from the upper realms to aid their former friends. Otherwise, the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect wouldn't be in this state.”</p><p>As they spoke, they emerged from the chaotic current channel, to see a vast crowd outside.</p><p>Cultivators, regardless of their cultivation level, had gathered.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were blocked outside the cloud wall; those below Golden Core couldn't even enter the channel and were all waiting nearby, hoping for the channel to reopen.</p><p>Tai Yue Mountain was bustling with people – never before had it been so lively.</p><p>The nuns and monks secretly flew to the edge of the crowd. The old nun opened her palm, revealing a warm jade pendant, emitting a soft glow – the treasure she had taken from the Buddhist pagoda.</p><p>“Because of the abbess's relationship, the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect treated Yan Yue Temple differently; we could directly teleport to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. The demonic calamity was devastating, causing the mountains and rivers of the Southern Border to shift. When the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect fell silent, our ancestors were forced to abandon our temple and flee.  After many searches, we couldn't find it, suspecting the temple had been destroyed.  This jade was a gift exchanged between the abbess and her Dao companion when they first met; it was later refined and used as a warning treasure. With the reappearance of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, the jade has regained its brilliance, and it might help us find the temple. Instead of risking a breakthrough through the cloud wall, let's try this.”</p><p>As she spoke, she closed her hand around the warm jade.</p><p>Using some unknown technique, the jade pendant's light began to change in a rhythmic pattern, though it was not very clear.</p><p>The old nun frowned slightly and suddenly flew towards the east side of Tai Yue Mountain.</p><p>Even after flying beyond Tai Yue Mountain, she didn't stop, and the other nuns, suppressing their curiosity, followed closely.</p><p>“That's Que Mountain.”</p><p>The young nun looked into the distance and whispered.</p><p>She had traveled extensively and was familiar with the terrain of the Southern State.</p><p>Que Mountain's ancestor was guarding the cloud wall within the channel, so they didn't need to worry.</p><p>The old nun flew straight towards Que Mountain.  Everyone was prepared to forcefully break through Que Mountain's formation, but unexpectedly, the old nun suddenly changed direction and increased her speed!</p><p>The nuns were baffled as they watched the old nun flit around Que Mountain, unsure whether the jade was malfunctioning or if the object they were seeking was moving rapidly.</p><p>Shortly after, the old nun plunged downward, directly into a deep ravine behind Que Mountain, and shouted, “Open!”</p><p>The jade flew from her hand.</p><p>It hovered in the center of the ravine, and the void trembled slightly before suddenly emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>The other nuns had already flown above the ravine, working together to shield the phenomenon from outsiders.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>The old nun's joy turned to surprise. Behind the phenomenon was a nearly ruined temple, a far cry from its former glory; only a few dilapidated old halls remained.</p><p>Besides the nuns of Yan Yue Temple, mysterious figures elsewhere were also searching for something, but most returned disappointed.</p><p>…</p><p>On the edge of Tai Yue Mountain.</p><p>This area was filled with towering peaks and rugged terrain, the most complex part of the entire Tai Yue Mountain.</p><p>There were many dangerous places here, such as poisonous pools and Yin煞 valleys.</p><p>In a dark valley, a wisp of black smoke suddenly appeared, revealing two strangely shaped shadows.  They writhed and transformed into human form.</p><p>Two figures, exceptionally tall—nine feet each—would surely stand out in any crowd.  Their appearance, however, was even more striking.</p><p>One had gills like a fish, and a mouth that seemed like a gaping wound across his face, from ear to ear, hideously grotesque. The other sported wings sprouting from his ribs, a long nose and pointed beak, and pristine white feathers, each one gleaming like jade.  A few feathers were slightly ruffled; he instinctively tried to smooth them but couldn’t reach.</p><p>“Whew… that old nun’s gaze was incredibly sharp. We were almost discovered hiding beneath the formation…”</p><p>The fish demon patted his chest, still shaken.</p><p>The bird demon stretched his neck, using his beak to preen his feathers before retracting it, contentedly.  “I thought the prettiest young nun was even more formidable.  Only the Great Sage himself could possibly subdue her.”</p><p>The fish demon clicked his tongue. “The humans truly are a nest of vipers. And this is just the Southern Frontier region! No wonder the Saint King agreed to divide the land by the sea. Human experts are multiplying.  Qing Mao Shu and Hei Shi are far away in Jinyu State; they’ll never make it in time. The Great Sage ordered us to scatter, but I don't know how many… non-human opponents we'll face.”</p><p>“These nuns are strange; they’re not entering the sacred realm, but doing the opposite,” the bird demon observed, soaring into the air for a wider view.</p><p>The fish demon mused, “The old nun seems to possess some treasure. The energy fluctuations betrayed their presence.  They likely have another plan.  Unfortunately, it’s just the two of us; otherwise, we could follow them and reap the rewards.”</p><p>The bird demon turned toward the passage. “Let’s wait and see. Maybe there will be a chance to fish in troubled waters.”</p><p>The fish demon scoffed. “Be careful you don't lose your life! Human cultivators are like mad dogs when they see us! Didn’t those humans we captured say this might be the ruins of some ancient human sect?  There probably won't be many treasures useful to us. We should stay here and wait for the Great Sage’s orders.”</p><p>“I hope the Great Sage arrives soon.”</p><p>The two demons exchanged a few more words before silently disappearing into the shadows.</p><p>…</p><p>“Bingyi Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body ascended the spirit path toward Lang…  His external avatar flew for a while before reaching the ice palace.</p><p>Getting closer, he realized the palace's grandeur. The real ice palace perfectly mirrored the image in the mysterious ice disc: layered terraces and pavilions, displaying the image of a celestial palace. At the entrance, a plaque read: Bingyi Palace!</p><p>It was somewhat different from his expectations; there was no mention of water. But besides the Water Phase lineage, what other faction would need a palace of this scale?</p><p>Qin Sang was almost certain he hadn't made a mistake.</p><p>His external avatar looked around, seeing no one nearby, approached the Bingyi Palace gate. The gate was ajar; he opened it effortlessly.</p><p>Despite being an ice palace, there was no biting cold.</p><p>A small lake came into view. A gentle breeze blew across a colorful lotus in full bloom—a solitary splash of color in the desolation.</p><p>The lake was nearly dry; weeds grew profusely.</p><p>The avatar took out the mysterious ice disc, then hid it in his sleeve, sealing its aura with a secret technique.  Entering through the main gate, he immediately noticed the ruined balustrade around the lake, overgrown with vines and withered grass.</p><p>The avatar brushed aside the overgrowth, examining it closely.  Time had erased many traces, but some information remained.</p><p>“A great battle took place here!” Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>The old chaos had spread even here, with the enemy attacking Bingyi Palace.  No wonder the Wuxiang Immortal Sect abandoned its sect and scattered in flight.</p><p>It was impossible to discern the techniques used by either side from these traces.</p><p>The avatar looked around, noticing many spirit trees along the lakeshore, some survivors, rare even in the outside world.  But his goal was clearly not these. He flickered to the top of a tree, spotting three paths leading into the woods. He chose the left one.</p><p>After walking for a while, the avatar returned. The end of this path seemed to be a side hall, even more dilapidated than the lakeshore. The ancient halls hadn't collapsed, but were severely damaged and empty.</p><p>Surprisingly, he hadn't encountered any restrictions as powerful as those on the cliff, which was illogical.  He hadn't even had a chance to test the mysterious ice disc.</p><p>“Could Bingyi Palace have been completely destroyed?” the avatar muttered, heading towards the right path.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the right side hall was much the same. He wasted no more time, returning to the middle path and rushing forward.</p>
