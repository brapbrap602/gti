Chapter 411: Refining the Yin Form


While Qin Sang spent years cultivating in the Tianjing Secret Realm during his time at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he always meticulously prepared gifts for Qi Yuanshou, Yu Yangzi, and others upon returning to Xuanlu Pass.


Qi Yuanshou's choice perfectly aligned with Qin Sang's wishes.


His cultivation method was indeed unsuitable for prolonged seclusion in a cave.


Unless he intended to betray his sect, he absolutely could not disobey the sect's assigned tasks. Fortunately, Qi Yuanshou mediated, saving him from this predicament.


Qin Sang immediately rose and bowed, offering his sincere thanks.


“I’ll leave it entirely to Master Uncle Qi!”


Qi Yuanshou nodded slightly, gesturing for Qin Sang to sit. He then asked, “Are you returning to Xuanlu Pass to cultivate? The influence of the Spiritual Tide is growing stronger, and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is becoming unstable. I can write a letter for you to give to your Senior Brother Rong; your Shadow Guard duties can be waived.”


Unexpectedly, Qin Sang shook his head. “With respect, Master Uncle Qi, I plan to cultivate in Wuya Valley for a while and will not return to Xuanlu Pass for now.”


Indeed, in Qingyang Market Town, Qin Sang made the decision to forgo Xuanlu Pass and cultivate in Wuya Valley instead.


He had already secured a cave dwelling in Qingyang Market Town, paying a hefty sum.  His ability to cultivate there, and live so lavishly, was thanks to Yu Hua's generous contribution of spirit stones.


Furthermore, with the acquisition of the Seamless Blood Mulberry, he no longer needed to spend spirit stones on spirit wood, making his cultivation resources much more abundant.


His reasons for staying in Qingyang Market Town were twofold.


First, Qingyang City was not far from the northern part of Qingyang Market Town, making it convenient to investigate and monitor the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect.


Second, it was for the Qingyang Gangying of the Qingyang Demon Sect.


Another Qiantian Gangying was located in a Nascent Soul cultivator's cave dwelling—Qin Sang didn't even dare to consider it.


The Qingyang Demon Sect was different.  To his knowledge, even the Qi Condensation disciples of the Qingyang Demon Sect could cultivate the Qingyang Demon Fire, and access to the Qingyang Gangying might present an opportunity.


Qingyang Market Town was located at the foot of the Qingyang Demon Sect mountain, very close to the sect. Qin Sang planned to stay there, gradually uncovering the sect's secrets.


All of this was for the sake of his Golden Core breakthrough, a measure of prudent preparation.


Wuya Valley was teeming with demons and monsters.  Cultivating there would offer similar benefits to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, having little impact on his cultivation.


“Wuya Valley?”


Qi Yuanshou frowned, his gaze stern.  “Deep within the Tian Duan Mountains, the heartland of the demonic sects. What are your chances of survival?”


Qin Sang said confidently, “Master Uncle Qi, rest assured. I will disguise myself as a loose cultivator and have some means to ensure my safety.”


He had the Ten Directions Yanluo Formation and protective treasures, as well as the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman and other valuable items, particularly once Yu Hua refined the living corpse and the Ebony Sword absorbed the Seamless Blood Mulberry, transforming into a treasure.


Qin Sang felt that he was not far from becoming invincible against those of his same cultivation level.


Qi Yuanshou uttered a sound of agreement, pondering for a moment before tossing Qin Sang a token.


“This is a secret order from a branch of the sect's secret guards in Qingyang City. If you encounter life-threatening danger, you can seek help from the branch.  You cultivate the ‘Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang’, your combat power far surpasses cultivators of your realm; remember to protect yourself.  I still have sect matters to handle, and I don’t want to be left without capable people.”


Qi Yuanshou gave Qin Sang a deep look.


Qin Sang was overjoyed, receiving the token with both hands.


This token was equivalent to an extra life.


As for Qi Yuanshou's orders, Qin Sang wasn't worried at all; his only fear was that Qi Yuanshou wouldn't use him!


He believed that Qi Yuanshou wouldn't assign tasks beyond the capabilities of his trusted subordinates.


And with his hidden true strength, he would certainly be able to complete them easily.


Qi Yuanshou did not give any further instructions, so Qin Sang took his leave, bidding farewell to Qi Yuanshou and flying away from the Peak of the Sect Master. After pausing for a moment, he flew towards the Pagoda Peak.


Entering the area of Pagoda Peak where ancient texts were stored, Qin Sang patiently began to search.


A whole day later, Qin Sang emerged from Pagoda Peak, his eyes shifting uncertainly.


He had searched through the ancient texts hoping to find clues similar to the Wushang Secret Technique.


Unfortunately, the texts were severely scattered and incomplete, many reduced to mere fragments, and genuinely ancient texts were scarce.


Among these ancient texts, he only found a few lines in a fragmentary piece describing—in the ancient world of cultivation, there was an ascension path known as Taiyin Lianxing, the Corpse Transformation Path!


This was a genuine Xuanmen orthodox secret technique; cultivators who dedicated their bodies to the corpse path, with their true spirits remaining undiminished, had a chance to attain the immortal realm!


Unfortunately, the Taiyin Lianxing Secret Technique had long been lost.


Could the secret technique created by Wushang have something in common with Taiyin Lianxing?


Qin Sang didn't know.


He shook his head slightly, leaving Pagoda Peak and returning to Daoist Peak, where he saw familiar faces like Senior Brother Zhuangyan, and also Song Yi.


Song Yi, carrying Qin Sang’s token of trust, had joined Shaohua Mountain.


Zhuang Yan, knowing Song Yi was introduced by Qin Sang, kept Song Yi close, though other acolytes handled most tasks. Song Yi could focus on cultivation.  That's the advantage of having connections.

After some pleasantries, they visited the Moon-Asking Market. Qin Sang met with Master Wu again, discussing the art of refining weapons.  Afterwards, he went to Sky-Scar Tower to buy medicinal herbs for treating the corpse transformation.

Back at the Hui Long Temple, Qin Sang activated the barrier, sealing his cave for seclusion.

Inside the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, two objects before him: a corpse embryo created by Yu Hua, and the Interminable Blood Mulberry.

He'd been tirelessly experimenting, but refining Yu Hua remained elusive.  Qin Sang put Yu Hua into his corpse puppet bag, planning to try again after refining more living corpses.

Capturing a False Core stage cultivator is difficult, a rare opportunity, and crucial for Wu Shang's alchemy secret technique.  Success is essential.

Qin Sang believed Wu Shang wouldn't act without reason, but he needed to witness the living corpse's transformation into a Night-Flying Yaksha firsthand before fully trusting the technique.


Putting Yu Hua away, Qin Sang turned to the Interminable Blood Mulberry, breaking its enchantment.  Bloodlight shot skyward, spreading towards Qin Sang.

Qin Sang remained calm, grasping the mulberry and summoning the Ebony Sword from his spiritual sea.  Sensing the divine wood's aura, the Ebony Sword hummed joyfully, eager to consume the wood and enhance itself. Qin Sang was prepared.

He tossed the mulberry into the air, then activated the Ebony Sword.  Powerful sword energy enveloped the mulberry.  In an instant, the cave was ablaze with the sword's azure light and the mulberry's eerie bloodlight.

Truly a divine wood!  Other spirit wood, regardless of quality, couldn't withstand the Ebony Sword's absorption, yet the Interminable Blood Mulberry resisted.  The two were locked in a stalemate!

The bloodlight from the mulberry intensified, countering the Ebony Sword. The Ebony Sword, undeterred, continued its song, its light growing stronger.

Qin Sang watched the spectacle, marveling and feeling even more optimistic about the future!  He closed his eyes slightly, linking his consciousness to the Ebony Sword, fully assisting it.

Time passed, the two extraordinary objects remained locked in struggle.  With Qin Sang's aid, the Ebony Sword grew more aggressive, while the Interminable Blood Mulberry began to weaken.
