Chapter 418: Sword Qi and Thunderous Sound


After a moment's hesitation, the man in silver raised his arm. Ten small, strange ghost banners flew from his palm.  He expertly prepared the Ten Directions Yama Formation.


His speed was astonishing. The ten ghost banners crisscrossed frequently, and the formation was completed in an instant.


Black flames ignited, but the silver-clad man extinguished them with a wave of his hand.  The ten ghost banners floated in the air, the formation filled with a terrifying, devouring darkness, yet all fluctuations were perfectly concealed.


He then swept his arm, storing the Ten Directions Yama Formation in his sleeve.  His figure melted into the shadows, silently approaching the mountain range.


Shortly after, the man in silver arrived at the foot of a solitary peak.


The peak was like a sword, exceptionally steep—a rare sight in this wide, gentle mountain range.


The spiritual energy here wasn't abundant, but that wasn't surprising.  Some places have hidden spiritual veins, rich and concealed, difficult to discover without careful investigation.


The man in silver tightly sealed his aura, his gaze sweeping over the peak, finally settling on an inconspicuous blue stone halfway up the mountain.


The next moment, he appeared before the stone.  He stared at it for a while, a mocking smile spreading across his face. With a flick of his sleeve, the Ten Directions Yama Formation spun out, the ghost banners lengthening in the wind.


In an instant, the ten banners transformed into gigantic flags, each several meters tall, directly piercing the mountainside to surround the stone.  The flags billowed, countless evil spirits seemed ready to burst forth, ghostly ribbons swirling with black fire, obscuring the sun.


*Whoosh!*


The black fire exploded, layer upon layer, surging madly towards the central stone.


A purple glow of restriction flickered on the stone, but it was instantly overwhelmed by the endless black fire, without even a ripple.


A muffled sound echoed.


*Bang!*


The stone shattered, revealing a deep hole.  Among the flying debris, remnants of the shattered restriction were visible, broken by brute force!


The man in silver remained cautious, staying behind the formation, his consciousness subtly extending, maintaining constant vigilance.


He glanced into the depths of the hole.


Unexpectedly, at that moment, a sudden change occurred!


The passage plunged into darkness, then a black current, like flowing water, surged out—identical to the black fire outside.


Deep within the black fire, another Ten Directions Yama Formation was already set up, and within the formation, a figure flickered indistinctly.


“Ten Directions Yama Formation!”


The black fire obscured the person's features, but the silver-clad man sensed a piercing gaze fixed on him, icy cold, making him feel like a target under attack. His expression changed drastically.


A trap!


In an instant, several thoughts flashed through his mind.


Someone possessing the Ten Directions Yama banners… could it be those treacherous 'brothers' targeting him?


Which one?


Few in their sect mastered this poisonous insect technique, and even fewer survived.


The silver-clad man suddenly extended his consciousness, finding no other ambushers. He felt a slight relief, then a cruel smile appeared on his face. He instantly activated his heart-eating insect.


"Kill!"


However, the figure opposite remained motionless, no scream, not even a flinch.


The man in silver's expression froze, fixed in a strange grimace.


He sensed that whoever set this trap, luring him in, must have a way to control the heart-eating insect;  killing him with the insects was unlikely.


But all he needed was for the insects to take effect, hindering his opponent's movements.


Even if his opponent could neutralize the insects, it wouldn't be instantaneous.  Any sign of weakness would be exploited for a counterattack, a decisive victory.


But the silver-clad man hadn’t expected the insect to be completely ineffective, not the slightest impact.


Simultaneously, he noticed something wrong with the flowing black fire. Behind it, a flame far deeper than the black fire radiated an aura that sent shivers down his spine!


A terrifying aura, a sudden realization, his pupils dilated, a horrified cry escaping him.


“Nine Nether Demon Flame! A treasure!”


The five Ten Directions Yama banners passed down by the ancestor, except for his master's one, their whereabouts unknown. They suspected they'd fallen into the hands of the Yuanzhao Sect, but they appeared here instead.


Who is this person?!

The man in silver was utterly bewildered, but he didn't even consider investigating. At that moment, he was completely certain this was a trap set for him.  His opponent wielded a powerful artifact and possessed far greater strength than he could have imagined.

Fortunately, there was only one opponent!

The Nine Nether Demon Flame surged forward with terrifying speed, about to burst from the cave entrance and engulf him.

Through their linked minds, the man in silver could feel his Ten Directions Yama Formation trembling. The main spirits within the ghost banners were screaming in terror.

The situation was critical.

The man in silver's eye twitched, his face contorted in a grimace of pain.  He made an instant decision, slamming his palm onto the Ten Directions Yama Formation.  His dantian revolved furiously, his spiritual energy pushed to its limit, pouring into the formation. The black flames erupted, and he forcibly extracted the main spirits, thrusting them into the heart of the black fire.

Then, he unleashed the black flames at the Nine Nether Demon Flame, a suicidal attack.

Having done this, the man in silver was pale, but without a backward glance at the Ten Directions Yama Formation, he abandoned the powerful array, his foot striking the ground, transforming into a streak of blood-red light and fleeing at top speed.

*BOOM!*

The black fire of the Ten Directions Yama Formation was overwhelmed by the Nine Nether Demon Flame.  All the main spirits were annihilated, the ten ghost banners trembled violently, shattering into nothingness.

The Nine Nether Demon Flame dissipated, and a figure emerged from the cave – Qin Sang.

He stood at the cave mouth, gazing at the horizon.  The blood-red light was astonishingly fast, disappearing from sight.

The man in silver was clearly doing everything he could to escape.

His caution and decisiveness were unprecedented in Qin Sang’s experience.  Despite the advantage of having the Heart-Eating Insect Gu, he prepared the formation in advance, thwarting Qin Sang's ambush.  In the face of danger, he didn't hesitate to abandon the Ten Directions Yama Formation, buying himself time to escape.

No wonder this man had earned the favor of Daoist Jiupao, becoming his most favored disciple. And even under the relentless pursuit of the Yuanzhao Sect, he remained safe and sound, successfully cultivating to the False Core stage.

Alas, all his efforts were in vain.

Qin Sang watched the fleeing light, a cold smile on his face. With a thought, a green light shot from his forehead, circling before him before settling and revealing its true form:

An exquisitely crafted small sword.

This sword was Qin Sang's life-bound spiritual sword – the Ebony Sword!

The Ebony Sword's appearance hadn't changed much, only its body was now far clearer and more translucent, without a trace of impurities, like polished glass.
