<h1>Chapter 2121: A Narrow Escape</h1><p>Qin Sang's previous restraint was expected; after all, their defeat had been swift and humiliating.  They continuously sent waves of attackers to force more variations in her defenses, hoping to deduce a counter-strategy.</p><p>To target Qin Sang, Shi Mu and Shi Ying even used a trump card, only to have it broken so easily. While Qin Sang's strength was undoubtedly a factor, their own shortcomings played a part. They had left a companion beast behind in the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram, meaning they weren't at full strength.  This wasn’t a lack of trust in the Diagram; they simply trusted themselves more.</p><p>Furthermore, they were wary of Qin Sang having hidden allies who might launch a surprise attack.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang's skillful evasion completely neutralized their offensive, exceeding their expectations and causing them to lose focus on another part of the battle.</p><p>High above, the sky blazed with lightning; numerous thunder gods appeared and disappeared. Each thunder god pointed their weapon skyward, summoning bolts of lightning that seemed to connect to the heavens.  Countless sparks leaped between them, forming dazzling chains of lightning held by the thunder gods, creating a massive net of thunder that enveloped the battlefield.</p><p>The thunder gods raged, their lightning chains swirling!</p><p>A terrifying surge of lightning energy filled the air.  The strategy of the Level Two Air Realm expert was cautious and methodical.  Repeated attacks by the thunder gods were fruitless. However, when the Twelve Thunder God Talismans suddenly unleashed their power, he didn’t falter. With a single command, the formation erupted in bursts of dark energy.</p><p>The black energy was inky and resembled a tide capable of consuming everything.</p><p>The lightning chains pierced the void with boundless power. Even with a timely response, the expert felt a jolt of fear.</p><p>*BOOM!* The first lightning chain struck the formation, hitting a mass of dark energy.  The cultivators within were obscured by the dark energy; a flash of lightning, and both the dark energy and the cultivators beneath vanished into thin air.</p><p>Lightning rained down from the sky, the chains deliberately avoiding the Level Two Air Realm expert, targeting Lu Wang's subordinates.  In an instant, the expert watched helplessly as swaths of his formation were wiped out. As he was about to intervene, he heard Shi Mu and Shi Ying call out, "Retreat!"</p><p>Shi Mu gave Qin Sang a deep look before decisively ordering the retreat.  Having witnessed the power of Qin Sang's evasion and forced a second change in the thunder gods’ attacks, they didn't consider it a complete failure.</p><p>Lu Gan repeated his strategy, activating the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram to ensure Shi Mu and the others' safe withdrawal. Calm returned to the battlefield.</p><p>Over the next few days, they analyzed their experience, and sent out another small team, still led by three Level Two Air Realm experts, but with many more subordinates. The peace within the Thunder Marsh was shattered once more.</p><p>This encounter unfolded similarly to the previous ones: the attackers signaled Lu Gan upon showing signs of defeat and retreated, then the cycle repeated.  This pattern continued, with intervals ranging from a few days to two weeks between attacks.</p><p>As they gained more understanding of Qin Sang and the Twelve Thunder God Talismans, the attackers became stronger and more organized, gradually turning the tide.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, showing no urgency, consistently fighting with one hundred and twenty thunder gods against the enemy.</p><p>Another retreat.</p><p>Lu Wang's entourage, surrounded by numerous experts, assembled.  Lu Wang looked around and said, "These past days, you all have worked tirelessly, probing the enemy's defenses.  The Grand Attendant and I have a clearer idea of how to break the formation. However, there's one thing: since the start of the conflict, only that Qin Zhenren has been involved. What do you all make of this?"</p><p>The experts looked pensive.  After so many battles, not only had Xia Changshi stayed out of it, but even Si Lu and the mysterious expert from the North Sea hadn't appeared.  Whether there were other hidden experts, they couldn't be certain. They might be lurking, ready to strike a fatal blow at any moment.</p><p>This was why, despite their superior strength, they hadn't dared to launch a full-scale assault.</p><p>After a brief silence, a cultivator in silver armor stepped forward, saying, "I have a suggestion.  Since that Qin Zhenren is so secretive, why not launch a massive attack, allowing the Grand Attendant to seize an opportunity?  If that Qin Zhenren is overwhelmed, they will surely call for reinforcements. If they still refuse to appear, we will take the opportunity to break through the Thunder God formation and gain an advantage!"</p><p>"Mountain Master Mo's suggestion is sound," said the Grand Attendant, looking at Lu Wang.</p><p>Lu Wang agreed.  "Let's do it this way!"</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>At the edge of the land, a large number of figures were visible – seven Level Two Air Realm experts, led by Shi Mu and Shi Ying, preparing to attack again.</p><p>"We ask the Grand Attendant to provide support."  Shi Mu bowed to the Grand Attendant, who had come to see them off.</p><p>The Grand Attendant nodded and transmitted his voice, "If you break the formation, I will keep my word and give you that item, my friends."</p><p>At these words, Shi Mu's eyes flashed with excitement.</p><p>To breach the formation, he and Shi Ying had painstakingly worked, repeatedly clashing with Qin Sang. This time, he would use himself as bait to lure out Xia Changshi, all for that promise!</p><p>“We will not fail you!”</p><p>Shi Mu roared, and the vast army marched towards Leize.</p><p>Inside Leize, a chilling atmosphere prevailed. Qin Sang's expression was grave, sensing the pressure. He gazed for a moment, then withdrew his gaze and vanished.</p><p>The scenery within Leize was monotonous. The cultivators advanced steadily, reaching the edge of the Leigong formation. Previously, they would be attacked upon arrival, but now, an unusual calm reigned.</p><p>After a secret discussion, Shi Mu ordered them to proceed.</p><p>Sure enough, they hadn't flown far when a torrential downpour of thunderbolts descended from the heavens.</p><p>“Form the Tianjing Formation!”</p><p>Including the Sky Realm Second Stage experts, no one hesitated; they immediately obeyed Shi Mu's command.</p><p>The battle formation transformed, taking the shape of the Bagua.  Silver light shone brilliantly above the formation; countless silver mirrors reflected the thunder, creating strange phenomena.</p><p>These mirrors not only reflected the light, but when lightning struck the surface, it was like striking water – ripples spread, and most of the thunder's power was dissipated.</p><p>Before the first wave subsided, the second onslaught followed.</p><p>Chains of lightning struck repeatedly. Within the formation, the mirrors stood upright, shooting out red ribbons.</p><p>These ribbons were extremely soft and incredibly flexible. They cleverly latched onto the lightning chains, instantly wrapping around them.</p><p>The incredibly powerful lightning chains, once entangled by the ribbons, lost their momentum. Despite the surging power, against the soft ribbons, they could only shake them slightly, unable to destroy them.</p><p>The second wave was easily neutralized.</p><p>Shi Mu ordered a swift advance. The formation, topped with silver mirrors and trailing red ribbons, spun and charged forward.</p><p>The third wave followed immediately. Countless rings of lightning exploded in the void, but the formation was already shrouded in a layer of green.  Green vines sprouted from the cultivators, rapidly spreading to their companions. In an instant, countless vines filled the gaps in the formation.</p><p>The formation became a sea of green vines. When the rings of lightning spread, a green glow emanated from the vines' surface.</p><p>After a flash of lightning, the vines thinned considerably, but through the gaps, it could be seen that the people within were unharmed.</p><p>The fourth wave, the fifth wave…</p><p>The Twelve Leigong Talismans in Qin Sang's hands displayed masterful changes, the attacks wave after wave, each one different. This even surpassed the potential of the Twelve Leigong Talismans themselves.  Qin Sang's inheritance from the Wu Lei Academy’s seal had given him such a profound understanding of the Way of Thunder.</p><p>Unfortunately, the enemy had countermeasures for each attack. After several waves, they only slowed the enemy's advance.</p><p>Clearly, the Twelve Leigong Talismans were being figured out.</p><p>However, this was still not the full extent of its power!</p><p>Qingyang Temple, main altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body silently chanted incantations, and the altar beneath him trembled. The Leigong from the Western Lands appeared simultaneously.</p><p>“Halt!”</p><p>Shi Mu's expression was serious as he looked at the Leigong in the sky.</p><p>He noticed that the Leigong's appearance was different; their weapons faintly glowed with a bluish-green light.</p><p>Shi Mu's heart jolted.  "Qin Zhenren can actually use that Azure Thunder here!"</p><p>Some present had previously experienced the power of the Azure Luan True Thunder. Qin Sang's attacks were already incredibly fierce, and with the addition of this thunder, they were almost impossible to withstand.</p><p>One hundred and twenty Leigong simultaneously unleashed the Azure Luan True Thunder. The very thought of such a spectacle was enough to make one's scalp tingle!</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Qin Sang, able to use the Azure Luan True Thunder to inscribe the Sacrifice Thunder Oath Scroll, could use it to inscribe third-order talismans.  However, the Azure Luan True Thunder was of too high a grade.  The Twelve Leigong Talismans, being third-order talismans, couldn't withstand it, and only a portion of the thunder power was integrated –  still formidable.</p><p>*Boom!* The Leigong raised their weapons, their tips dazzling with bluish-green light.</p><p>*Crackle!* Blue-green lightning erupted from the weapons, thinner and less imposing than before.</p><p>The Azure Thunder attacked simultaneously.</p><p>The power was far more terrifying than the spectacle. Wherever it passed, the formation was in chaos, the silver mirrors and other objects were rendered useless, and lives were wantonly harvested by the Azure Thunder.</p><p>Several experts reacted quickly, using their treasures, summoning their spirit beasts, or employing their magical powers.</p><p>Shi Mu summoned a treasure.</p><p>It was a double-eared earthenware jar. The jar was lidless, with the sound of water inside, but the water's surface was invisible, the mouth of the jar pitch black.</p><p>Shi Mu used a magical incantation to draw out a stream of clear water, which sprayed into the air, dispersing into a very thin mist.  Many tiny droplets fell onto the cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators felt a sudden enlightenment and began to breathe, their auras surging.</p><p>A rainbow shimmered into view through the mist, its far end disappearing beyond the thunder generals, its destination unknown.</p><p>This was their prepared escape method, now forced into use.  If all went well, the cultivators would be warped and absorbed into the rainbow, becoming one with it.  Only the rainbow itself would be visible, not the cultivators.</p><p>As they advanced along the rainbow bridge, each step unleashed a strange wave that repelled their enemies.  Shi Mu, unwilling to retreat empty-handed again, decided to counterattack, the rainbow light rapidly spreading across the battlefield.</p><p>Suddenly, on the left flank, a silver-armored cultivator at the second stage of the Void Realm felt a premonition of danger.  He hastily summoned his companion beast, simultaneously warning his comrades.</p><p>A white weasel appeared before the silver-armored cultivator, while his own companion beast whimpered and retreated.  The weasel's eyes shone with a bloody light, its ferocity unmistakable.</p><p>"Frost Weasel!"  the silver-armored cultivator exclaimed, his voice filled with alarm.  "It's Si Lu!"</p><p>His attack drew everyone's attention; a nearby expert immediately came to his aid.  The frost weasel vanished in a flash, dodging the attack, its whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Simultaneously, on the other side of the battlefield, a shadow emerged—a spirit tablet, massive as a mountain, hurtling towards a grey-robed cultivator.</p><p>The grey-robed cultivator was startled, but managed to warn others, "It's Qin Sang!"</p><p>Knowing he was no match for Qin Sang, but retreat being untenable, he spat out a transparent object resembling a jellyfish, which rapidly expanded.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The spirit tablet impacted like hitting cotton. The ‘jellyfish’ was struck back to its original form, but the grey-robed cultivator was unharmed.</p><p>The battlefield was a whirlwind of activity:  blue lightning flashing, the situation shifting constantly.</p><p>The twelve Thunder God talismans, top-tier third-order spells from the Dao Court, were being cast by Qin Sang's dharma body through an altar, infused with Azure-luan lightning power. Their current destructive force was immense.</p><p>Under the onslaught of blue lightning, Shi Mu's formation faltered.  The rainbow bridge was reforming, before they could reorganize, Qin Sang and Si Lu appeared.</p><p>Shi Mu pushed the earthenware pot to its limits, Shi Ying beside him, shielding him from the lightning while remaining vigilant.  To his left, Si Lu's frost weasel was surrounded by two opponents.  To his right, three others attempted to encircle Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, golden light blazed forth. A second sun appeared on the chaotic battlefield. The grey-robed cultivator, sensing danger, retreated swiftly, only to see lightning approaching at terrifying speed.</p><p>"Stop him!" he yelled.</p><p>Two companions exchanged glances. One threw a bronze seal, which fell from the sky with immense force, attempting to subdue Qin Sang.  The other, an elder, summoned three identical companion beasts—headless, limbless creatures whose bodies were giant mouths, emitting powerful suction, targeting Qin Sang.</p><p>Even the Heavenly Trapping Golden Lock couldn't restrain Qin Sang; he easily broke free from the bronze seal. However, he didn't resist the suction, allowing himself to be pulled towards the elder.</p><p>During the exchange, attention wasn't solely focused on Qin Sang; everyone was on guard against sneak attacks. They had escape methods, but their opponent was Xia Changshi, a top expert from their own clan; no one knew the depth of his abilities or whether he could cut off their retreat.</p><p>The elder, realizing Qin Sang had willingly charged, sensed danger—Qin Sang was the greatest threat.  Two streams of five-colored light shot forth.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Light, a potent restraint, instantly froze the elder. Then, the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light struck!</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu had attempted this before: launching two consecutive Five Elements Divine Light attacks with hopes of preventing the Si You clan from utilizing their mutual transformation technique. But the timing was crucial; he could restrain the opponent's true form, but not their companion beast.</p><p>The companion beast's reaction was only slightly slower, and the will remaining in the beast could still activate the technique.</p><p>This attack’s timing was impeccable. The elder, caught off guard, was nearly hit by the Reverse Five Elements Divine Light, when a rich Xuanhuang light suddenly surged from him, accompanied by waves, like a funnel in the void.</p><p>The elder's form twisted, drawn into the funnel, disappearing without a trace. The Reverse Five Elements Divine Light passed by, leaving him unharmed.</p><p>But the display of the Five Elements Crown startled everyone. Shi Mu decisively retracted the earthenware pot, "Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Five Elements Crown and slowly turned, only to see the Grand Attendant appear at the edge of the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>They seemed to see each other, engaging in a silent 'stare' across the distance.</p>
