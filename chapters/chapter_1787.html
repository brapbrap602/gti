<h1>Chapter 1778: Divine Firmament Thunder Seal</h1><p>“No wonder the cultivators of this realm are skilled in the Dao of Talismans.  They begin interacting with divine talismans from the very start of their cultivation…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, sighing inwardly.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Register uses a divine talisman as its foundation.</p><p>Each Dharma Register corresponds to a different divine talisman. The divine talisman corresponding to Qin Sang's current Dharma Register is called the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman!</p><p>This divine talisman is the very root of the Dharma Register's existence, and also the basis for forging the altar.</p><p>After disciples of the Thunderclap Left Prefecture receive the Dharma Register, as their cultivation improves, they gradually comprehend this talisman, and slowly perfect their altar.</p><p>The Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman is extremely complex.</p><p>This kind of complex divine talisman is composed of multiple talismanic forms assembled according to specific procedures. These components that constitute the divine talisman are also called Dispersed Forms.</p><p>Each Dispersed Form has different patterns, divine inscriptions, structures, spiritual apertures, and incantations when drawn, and no errors are tolerated.</p><p>Some Dispersed Forms are even divine talismans themselves.</p><p>When all the Dispersed Forms are combined and merged into a whole, the divine talisman is complete. This step is called Gathering Form or Combining Form.</p><p>Learning talismans requires understanding how to read them first. One must disassemble each Dispersed Form from the entire talismanic form, thoroughly comprehend the Dispersed Forms, and then recombine them into the complex Combined Form to be considered accomplished.</p><p>There are many types of structural forms for divine talismans.</p><p>Simpler ones are formed by combining several Dispersed Forms on the same plane, making it easy to discern the talismanic structure.</p><p>However, complex Grand Talismans are often formed by the aggregation and overlapping of various Dispersed Forms, layered and accumulated. The individual Dispersed Forms are invisible, requiring cultivators to expend significant mental effort to slowly comprehend them.  Only those with unwavering perseverance and profound attainments can succeed.</p><p>And this is just the beginning.  How to simplify the complex and wield the divine talisman freely is also a profound art.</p><p>The Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman is such a complex Grand Talisman, at least for Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>However, the Dharma Register has already clearly deconstructed the talismanic form. Otherwise, disciples newly bestowed with the Dharma Register wouldn't even be able to discern the Dispersed Forms, let alone forge the altar.</p><p>When forging the altar, the talismanic form can be considered the altar's framework.</p><p>As long as a cultivator comprehends the first Dispersed Form of the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman, they can begin forging the altar.</p><p>It can be compared to building a house.  The first Dispersed Form is equivalent to laying the foundation, and then adding bricks and tiles layer by layer.</p><p>In this way, a sturdy altar is gradually built.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang hadn't dedicated himself to studying the Dao of Talismans and rarely had the opportunity to personally draw talismans.  However, he had used plenty of spirit talismans and understood the essence of the Dao of Talismans to some extent.</p><p>Moreover, the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman wasn't particularly profound.  Even if he knew nothing about the Dao of Talismans, comprehending it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Without expending much effort, Qin Sang grasped the first Dispersed Form.</p><p>He opened his eyes, pondered for a moment, then raised a finger, moving it delicately. Spiritual light flickered at his fingertip, leaving a radiant trail in the void, and the first Dispersed Form was complete.</p><p>Looking at this Dispersed Form, Qin Sang's face took on a contemplative expression.</p><p>The Dispersed Form hung in mid-air, its spiritual light flowing like water, with faint traces of thunder flickering within, resembling a mystical rune.</p><p>Naturally, drawing talismans also has its own methodology.  Just as mortals use characters to write essays, the Dao of Talismans also has special runes.</p><p>Runes are characters, Dispersed Forms are paragraphs, and Combined Forms are the complete essay.</p><p>A Dispersed Form might be a single special rune or composed of countless runes.</p><p>The sources of runes are often derived from cultivators' insights into the heavens and earth, observing the myriad phenomena, drawing inspiration from the forms of clouds and stars, imitating the markings of insects and the traces of birds, and so on.</p><p>Talisman Masters categorize runes based on their effects and origins, classifying them into Divine Palace Jade Inscriptions, Jade Palace Spirit Inscriptions, Cloud Seal Thunder Inscriptions, Dragon Flower Phoenix Markings, and many others.</p><p>These various runes can form talismans individually or be combined into different divine talismans with different powers.</p><p>The Dispersed Form before Qin Sang was composed of Thunder Inscriptions.</p><p>The High Divine Firmament Sect venerates the Thunder Ancestor and cultivates thunder techniques, so the fundamental components of the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman are all Thunder Inscriptions.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to a special aperture within the Dispersed Form. This is another crucial aspect of the divine talisman – the Spiritual Aperture!</p><p>As the saying goes:</p><p>Draw a talisman without knowing the aperture, and you'll provoke laughter from ghosts and gods.</p><p>Draw a talisman knowing the aperture, and you'll frighten ghosts and gods!</p><p>This aperture is no ordinary aperture. It's formed by the confluence of heaven and earth, and it's called the Divine Qi Acupoint.</p><p>Like the acupoints of the human body, it channels Qi within, permeating the talismanic form, connecting heaven and earth, and converging divine intent.  It can be considered the heart of the talisman.</p><p>The combination of Dispersed Forms isn't a simple superposition. Only when the apertures are aligned, the spiritual apertures interconnected, and the flow of intent and Qi is unobstructed can it truly be a talisman.</p><p>The more complex the divine talisman, the more spiritual apertures it has.</p><p>The first Dispersed Form of the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman has only one spiritual aperture, the very aperture Qin Sang was looking at.</p><p>After the Dharma Altar is forged, the Dharma Register resides within this spiritual aperture.  Every subsequent combination of apertures will be based on this spiritual aperture.</p><p>With a thought, several streams of light flew out from the Thousand Jun Ring and landed before Qin Sang.</p><p>Among them were two vials of golden blood, one brilliantly gold, the other slightly dimmer.</p><p>There was also a piece of withered wood constantly emitting green lightning and a spiritual herb with thunder-shaped markings on its leaves.</p><p>The withered wood was Green Firmament Tree Root, and the spiritual herb was called Thunder Responding Grass.</p><p>The two vials of blood were collected by Qin Sang while he was infiltrating the Thunder Hawk Demonic Kingdom, working for the Thunderclap Left Prefecture.  Both were the blood essence of Golden-Winged Thunder Hawks, one from the royal lineage, the other ordinary.</p><p>These four spiritual items were all prepared for forging the altar.</p><p>The Golden Seal Altar and the Soldier-Horse Altar, one a tangible altar, the other intangible.</p><p>The Soldier-Horse Altar needs to unify and connect the Qi of the subordinate soldiers and horses, combining their strength to form the talismanic shape. At higher cultivation levels, it can even allow generals to preside over other spiritual apertures.</p><p>Forging the Golden Seal Altar involves refining spiritual items to construct the talismanic form.</p><p>The grade of the spiritual items used in forging the altar will have a certain impact on the altar and the divine talisman, but higher grade isn't necessarily better.</p><p>For just the first Dispersed Form, using extremely high-grade spiritual items with excessively potent energy might actually overwhelm the spiritual aperture, causing the talismanic form to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the four spiritual items. He first took out a drop of blood essence from the royal Golden-Winged Thunder Hawk and tried it out, but as expected, it failed.</p><p>He didn't force it.  He took out the ordinary blood essence again, drew out a drop, and suspended it above his palm.</p><p>Newly initiated Daoists lack the ability to refine spiritual items.  As long as they can construct the altar using unrefined blood essence or medicinal power and keep it from collapsing, it's sufficient.  They can refine it later.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang didn't need to do this.  With a slight circulation of True Yuan, he refined all the impurities from the blood essence, retaining the purest bloodline power.</p><p>A single drop of blood essence was reduced to a point of pure bloodline thunder power. Then, Qin Sang flicked his finger, merging it into the Dispersed Form.</p><p>Visibly, a point of thunder light moved within the Dispersed Form, using thunder power as ink to trace the Thunder Inscriptions, completing the process in one go!</p><p>The Dispersed Form transformed into a thunder talisman, its spiritual light pulsing, resonating with the spiritual aperture.</p><p>With a thought from Qin Sang, the Dharma Register shot into the spiritual aperture.</p><p>In an instant, the altar was formed!</p><p>"This is my Dharma Altar."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the altar.</p><p>The altar had three levels, with four pillars symbolizing heaven, earth, sun, and moon, eight gates, and ten directions, consistent with the altars he had seen before.</p><p>Because it was a Golden Seal Altar, it appeared less grand and imposing compared to the Soldier-Horse Altars of the Celestial Court officials.</p><p>Because only the first Dispersed Form was completed, the altar resembled a phantom altar shadow. Within the shadow, several strands of thunder intertwined, surrounding the central spiritual aperture, forming the altar's skeleton.</p><p>At this moment, a seal hovered within the spiritual aperture.</p><p>The seal read: High Divine Firmament!</p><p>The seal was the true form of the Dharma Register, precisely the renowned Divine Firmament Thunder Seal of Mount Juzhi!</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the altar, carefully contemplating it for a moment. He suddenly opened his palm, and a talismanic shadow flashed within.</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder erupted, and a bolt of lightning struck a corner of the cave dwelling.</p><p>It was still night, and the outside of the cave dwelling was exceptionally quiet.</p><p>The sound of the thunder and the power of the lightning were both concealed by Qin Sang, so as not to disturb the cultivators outside.</p><p>What he had just used was the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman within the Dharma Register.</p><p>Because of the special nature of the Dharma Register, cultivators can use the corresponding divine talisman as soon as they construct the first Dispersed Form.</p><p>Of course, the power is weak at the beginning and gradually increases as the altar is constructed.</p><p>Most importantly, using this talisman is like using one's own divine ability.  With a thought, the talisman forms; with a wave of the hand, the power of the talisman manifests.</p><p>The lightning Qin Sang had just unleashed was the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman, formed with a point of his finger.</p><p>Spiritual aperture, Dispersed Form, Combined Form, not a single step could be missed.</p><p>It was evident that although divine talismans are powerful, drawing them is extremely complex, especially these complex Grand Talismans.  They cannot be accomplished instantly.  During a fight, it's impossible to draw a talisman while the enemy remains idle, wasting precious time.</p><p>Therefore, cultivators have devised various methods to shorten the time required.</p><p>The most common method is to use special spiritual materials to create talisman paper, talisman brushes, and cinnabar, preparing spirit talismans in advance that can be directly deployed against enemies.</p><p>Some also create talisman discs and other talismanic artifacts.  The talisman discs used by Su Zinan and Old Wu back then were of this kind.</p><p>There are also exceptionally talented individuals who deeply understand the Dao of Talismans and have thoroughly comprehended a specific divine talisman, allowing them to overlap spiritual apertures and simplify the talismanic form to its essence, retaining only its true meaning, enabling them to form talismans with a point of their finger.</p><p>Such geniuses are few and far between.  Moreover, most divine talismans can only be used as a means of combating enemies, and expending great effort to comprehend them for this purpose is often not worth the cost.</p><p>The flourishing of the Dao of Talismans in this realm is not only due to the complete inheritance, but also because the Dharma Altar allows ordinary cultivators to achieve instant talisman formation.</p><p>Cultivators of the Thunderclap Jade Prefecture all cultivate the High Divine Firmament Sect and understand the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman. This is their most commonly used and most readily available divine talisman, because it can be cast instantly.</p><p>To a certain extent, the Jade Purity Summoning Thunder Talisman can be considered their Natal True Talisman, and they'll obtain even more powerful divine talismans after ascending.</p><p>The Dharma Altar's function is not limited to this.</p><p>For other divine talismans besides the Natal True Talisman, a Talismanic Imprint gradually forms within the Dharma Altar during the comprehension process.</p><p>When casting the talisman, one only needs to activate the Talismanic Imprint to form the talisman out of thin air, greatly saving the cultivator's time and energy.</p><p>Even for divine talismans not yet fully mastered, the Dharma Altar can increase the success rate, shorten the casting time, and reduce the consumption of divine sense and magic power.</p><p>In a clash between cultivators, victory or defeat can be decided in an instant.</p><p>If both cultivators use Thunder Department divine talismans, the Dharma Altar can further enhance their power, providing immeasurable benefits.</p><p>The Thunderclap Jade Prefecture's thunder techniques are second to none in Mount Juzhi, so they must have corresponding Thunder Department divine talisman inheritances. Comprehending them with the aid of the Dharma Altar would likely be much easier, but unfortunately, they wouldn't be imparted to him, an outsider.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't particularly interested in these divine talismans. His purpose in receiving the Dharma Register was to restore his cultivation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang began recalling the *Facing Truth Jade Talisman Incantation*, preparing to cultivate his spirit.</p><p>"True Firmament True Decree, Nine Heavens Vast Mandate. Bestowed upon me, I receive, witnessing the radiant light... Ascending to the Divine Firmament, I take refuge in the precious steps..."</p><p>Lines of incantations surfaced in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>According to the Daoist rituals for spirit cultivation, before cultivating the spirit, one must recite the *Purifying Heart Mantra*, the first of the Eight Great Mantras, to purify the body and mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and stabilize the spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally didn't need so much, and it wasn't his first time cultivating his spirit.</p><p>At the beginning of cultivating the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, visualizing the divine beast Azure Phoenix was also a form of spirit cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, he calmed his mind, circulated the *Facing Truth Jade Talisman Incantation*, cultivating not the image of a deity, but the divinity within himself.</p><p>Quietly contemplating the true, observing the inner form and shadow.</p><p>Cultivating my spirit, visualizing my body.</p><p>If he were cultivating the image of a deity, it might take some time, but cultivating the inner truth quickly yielded a response.</p><p>Daoist legends say that the human body contains thirty-six thousand divinities.</p><p>In the midst of this profound mystery, Qin Sang sensed a thread of divine intent arising from his heart aperture, rising and falling with his thoughts, ethereal and elusive, as if attracted, flying towards the Dharma Altar on its own, settling within the Dharma Register, using the Dharma Register as its dwelling place.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed before Qin Sang gradually came to, finding that the thread of divine intent was still there, not dissipating when his thoughts wandered.</p><p>"Is this the Altar Protecting Divine General?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, feeling a sense of novelty.</p><p>In reality, cultivating the image of a deity doesn't truly summon the deity from the heavens. What's visualized is also a mysterious and profound divine intent.</p><p>The so-called Altar Protecting Divine General is actually divine intent residing within the altar. It cannot truly manifest its divine power, or there wouldn't be so many people questioning Daoist legends.</p><p>However, as cultivation increases and spirit cultivation continues day after day, the cultivator can sense the divine intent gradually strengthening.</p><p>It is this thread of divine intent that protects the cultivator's consciousness from becoming lost.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined it, primarily sensing the inner nature of the divine intent. Although not entirely clear, he faintly felt a slight Jade Buddha fluctuation.</p><p>Like his soul imprint, it was tinged with the power of the Jade Buddha, and its power would certainly be vastly different.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>Next, without hesitation, he repeated the altar forging process countless times.</p><p>Dispersed Forms were continuously integrated into the altar.  If anyone were to witness Qin Sang's altar forging speed, they would be utterly astounded.</p><p>After exhausting the ordinary blood essence, Qin Sang then used the royal blood essence. The altar neared completion, becoming barely usable.</p><p>Soon, the altar was forged in one fell swoop!</p><p>Now, the altar displayed far greater power than before. Within the altar, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal slowly rotated.</p><p>The Thunder Seal appeared to be formed from thunder light, completely translucent.</p><p>Bolts of lightning enveloped the Thunder Seal, interwoven into a complex electrical net. These lightning bolts seemed alive, their electrical arcs flickering.  With a slight thought from Qin Sang, thunder would be triggered, and lightning would vanish.</p><p>Everything happened silently and imperceptibly.  These lightning bolts were manifestations of the talismanic form and wouldn't leave the altar.</p><p>Having cultivated the *Supreme True Unity Boy Spiritual Officer General Register* to its peak in one go, Qin Sang didn't feel fatigued.</p><p>As for the divine intent within the Dharma Register, it wouldn't strengthen so quickly. It required Qin Sang to continuously practice spirit cultivation techniques for a period of time.  With his cultivation, it wouldn't take too long.</p><p>He silently circulated his cultivation technique, his Qi Sea revolving, absorbing and refining the surrounding spiritual energy, maintaining his True Yuan at the peak of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>There was no need to suppress it with divine sense; the True Yuan showed no signs of becoming unruly. However, before receiving a higher-level Dharma Register, both the total amount of True Yuan and the rate of absorbing spiritual energy had limits.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also discovered another powerful function of the Dharma Altar: it could assist cultivation, increasing the cultivation speed!</p><p>He thought to himself, no wonder cultivators in this realm had to divide their attention to comprehend talismanic forms and cultivate their spirits from the very beginning of their cultivation.  Both tasks consumed time and energy.</p><p>Even with the rich spiritual energy of this realm, it was still extremely arduous. The Dharma Altar, to a certain extent, solved the cultivators' worries in this regard.</p><p>So much effort was required to qualify for receiving the Dharma Register, yet forging the altar was so simple.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, stood up, and pushed the door open.</p><p>Outside, the sky was still dark. He glanced at the time, his figure flickered, and he vanished.</p><p>Next, it was time to seek the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Register of the Thunderclap Right Prefecture.</p><p>Not long after leaving the island, Qin Sang summoned his flying light and flew towards Pot Island, intending to visit Master Qi first.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
