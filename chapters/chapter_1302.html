Chapter 1294: Awakening

In the quiet chamber.

Yagu lay flat on her back, her eyes tightly shut, still resembling a sleeping beauty. Her cheeks were rosy, but within her seemingly vibrant body, a faint aura of death lingered. Before overexerting herself, although Yagu had not awakened, her condition had been gradually improving, as if she were merely asleep. Now, however, she resembled a statue, exuding nothing but lifelessness.

The Fat Silkworm was slumbering within Yagu's body.

After returning to the Little Cold Domain, Qin Sang had tried several times but had been unable to rouse the Fat Silkworm.

Qin Sang and Bai sat cross-legged.

After a moment of silence, Bai opened his eyes and nodded, saying, "It's rare. This girl's will is even more tenacious than I expected. She has been fighting all along, never giving up. Her consciousness has not sunk into the darkness."

Hearing these words, Qin Sang recalled Yagu's experiences.

From the moment she was born, she had fallen into darkness.

His appearance had brought a glimmer of light to her, but it had also brought her greater calamities.

She had stumbled forward in the darkness, never abandoning her longing for the light. Perhaps it was those very trials that had forged her resilient character.

Heaven helps those who help themselves.

It was precisely because Yagu had always been fighting that Qin Sang's actions held greater significance, not merely to fulfill his own beliefs.

At this moment, Bai handed Qin Sang a jade slip. "This contains a segment of the Bone Curse I deliberately selected. It is the most gentle part of the curse, the limit of what she can endure."

Qin Sang took the jade slip, surprised. "I'm to do it?"

"If not you, then who?" Bai snorted. "The Corpse Talisman within her was personally refined by you. You are, in a sense, her master. Inscribing the Bone Curse and guiding the power of the Corpse Talisman could easily damage her soul. There's no room for the slightest error, so of course, it must be you. Don't worry, I've detailed the method of casting the curse, and I'll assist you throughout the process."

Qin Sang's divine sense probed into the jade slip.

The first thing he saw was a Bone Curse that seemed vaguely familiar.

This segment of the Bone Curse was inscribed on Bai's arm bone, but it was not entirely the same as the original. Bai had made some modifications, allowing Yagu to withstand the power of the curse.

The method of casting the curse was also something Bai had comprehended on his own.

This ability alone filled Qin Sang with admiration. Truly, an ancient being who had lived to this day.

The Bone Curse was not complicated, and Qin Sang quickly grasped it.

An hour later.

The two sat cross-legged on either side of Yagu.

Qin Sang nodded to Bai, his gaze falling on Yagu's left arm.

Although Yagu had been subjected to the Corpse Talisman, the corpse energy had been suppressed by the vitality of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, and her body had not undergone corpse transformation. While in the Canglang Sea, every time Qin Sang consumed the Three Lights Jade Liquid to restore his true essence, he would transfer some of the vitality to Yagu. Thus, even after decades, Yagu's body still brimmed with vitality.

Her crystal-clear jade arm was adorned with beautiful patterns, the divine markings of the Witch Clan.

Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then sent his divine sense into Yagu's arm. After a careful examination, he suddenly raised both hands, his fingers moving like wheels. In an instant, a curse seal was formed.

His movements did not stop.

In the quiet chamber, spiritual energy rippled as peculiar runes flowed from Qin Sang's fingertips, one after another, sinking into Yagu's body.

Yagu's appearance remained unchanged.

But on her arm bone, golden runes gradually emerged, densely packed like ants. Under the reflection of these runes, her arm bone seemed to transform into a piece of golden bone.

Bai was not idle either, assisting Qin Sang in stabilizing the Bone Curse. Seeing the runes continuously sinking into Yagu's body without a hitch, a trace of surprise flashed in Bai's eyes.

At this moment, Qin Sang was multitasking, simultaneously sensing the Corpse Talisman and the Bone Curse.

As Bai had said, there was indeed a mysterious connection between the two. During the casting of the curse, he could use the Bone Curse to guide the power of the Corpse Talisman, thereby reducing its impact on Yagu.

"No matter what you feel, do not resist," Qin Sang murmured, though he wasn't sure if Yagu could hear him.

Then, the hand seals suddenly changed, completing the final secret technique!

Seeing this, Bai quickly set aside his distractions and focused entirely on assisting Qin Sang.

In the next moment, Qin Sang let out a low shout, forming an exceptionally complex hand seal. Both hands pressed down forcefully, one tightly gripping Yagu's arm, the other pointing at her brow.

'Boom!'

A brilliant golden light erupted.

Yagu's body trembled.

Moments later, the golden light faded. Qin Sang and Bai exchanged a glance, then immediately turned their attention to Yagu.

Qin Sang keenly sensed a faint ripple within Yagu's body. It was extremely weak, but undoubtedly a good omenâ€”her soul was reviving!

Bai's method had worked!

"Unexpectedly, this girl seems quite compatible with the Bone Curse. Her endurance is stronger than I anticipated," Bai remarked with a hint of admiration.

Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, then recalled that the process of casting the curse had indeed gone very smoothly. After a moment's thought, he said, "It's probably due to the Three Lights Jade Liquid. Her body has been continuously nourished by vitality, which must have greatly benefited her."

"Possibly," Bai nodded. "It might also have something to do with that Fat Silkworm. But this isn't a bad thing. Once her condition stabilizes, we can observe her for a while longer and then attempt a more complex Bone Curse. The effects will be even better."

As they conversed, subtle changes were quietly taking place within Yagu's body.

After the time it takes to burn an incense stick.

Under their watchful gazes, a faint seven-colored halo appeared on Yagu's brow.

"It's the Fat Silkworm!" Qin Sang exclaimed with joy, his eyes fixed on her brow.

The halo grew increasingly dense, then suddenly rippled. A short, stout figure shot out, aiming to leap into Qin Sang's arms, but Qin Sang caught it with a swift motion.

The Fat Silkworm had finally awakened!

Having slept for decades without food or water, the Fat Silkworm was still plump, though its flesh seemed a bit firmer.

'Chirp chirp...'

The Fat Silkworm conveyed a sense of closeness, rubbing against Qin Sang's palm and acting coquettishly. Its small eyes were filled with grievance, on the verge of tears, looking utterly pitiful.

However, Qin Sang was well acquainted with the Fat Silkworm's nature and saw through its little act at a glance.

This little guy was clearly starving.

Seeing that Qin Sang remained unmoved, it began to roll around frantically, as if protesting to Qin Sang that it had grown thin from hunger!

Qin Sang found this amusing. He took out a Toxic Algae Fruit from his Thousand Jun Ring.

At the sight of the tempting food, the Fat Silkworm's eyes gleamed with greed. It pounced, swallowing the Toxic Algae Fruit in one gulp.

One Toxic Algae Fruit was clearly not enough.

Worried that it couldn't handle the potent toxins, Qin Sang took out other food items. The Fat Silkworm wasn't picky, devouring them voraciously as if it were a starving ghost reincarnated.

Ignoring the ravenous Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang turned his attention to Yagu. The Fat Silkworm was her anchor in the real world. With its awakening, Yagu's condition had stabilized further. Qin Sang could sense faint emotional fluctuations.

After eating its fill, the Fat Silkworm rolled over lazily in Qin Sang's palm. Then, it transformed into a seven-colored halo and flew back into Yagu's brow.

Startled, Qin Sang quickly sent his divine sense into Yagu's Purple Mansion, only to find the Fat Silkworm nestled against her primordial spirit, sound asleep.

However, this time was different from before.

The Fat Silkworm was not in a deep slumber but, as before, was digesting the food it had just consumed while sleeping. Qin Sang could wake it at any time if he wished.
