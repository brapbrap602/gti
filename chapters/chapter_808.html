<h1>Chapter 800: Foundation of Cultivation</h1><p>The *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* scripture uses the power of the constellations to temper the body.</p><p>According to the scripture, during cultivation, while drawing upon the power of the constellations, a sinister and chaotic force is also drawn into the body.</p><p>This force is called Demonic Star Energy. It coexists with the celestial power, and those whose souls are invaded by it suffer terrible fates. Without exception, they descend into madness, lose their sanity, and ultimately transform into unspeakable beings, dying tragically.</p><p>However, *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* utilizes the bloodline power within demon beasts to refine this Demonic Star Energy, obtaining pure celestial power for body refinement.  Simultaneously, the cultivator can turn misfortune into a blessing, gradually purifying their bloodline during the process.</p><p>This is the crux of this cultivation technique.</p><p>Human cultivators lack the bloodline power of demon cultivators and cannot refine the Demonic Star Energy. Cultivating this technique would be suicidal for them. However, this is precisely where Qin Sang saw an opportunity.</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, he believed he could resist the Demonic Star Energy's invasion of his soul.</p><p>Having endured so many trials, the Jade Buddha had never failed him.</p><p>When demon cultivators practice *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, they must first activate their bloodline power to refine the Demonic Star Energy, not daring to leave a single trace.  Their cultivation speed is directly related to the strength of their bloodline, which is essentially their innate talent.</p><p>Qin Sang, not needing to divert his focus to refining the Demonic Star Energy, would be equivalent to the most talented demon cultivator, progressing much faster.</p><p>Of course, this way, *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* would become a pure body refinement technique in his hands. But if his understanding of the scripture was correct, even as a pure body refinement technique, it would still be top-tier, the best Qin Sang had ever seen, living up to its name!</p><p>Discovering this, Qin Sang was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>But he didn't let excitement cloud his judgment. After all, this was a technique created by a top demon cultivator, with no precedent of human cultivation. The Jade Buddha could resist the Demonic Star Energy, but the technique itself might have other effects on him.</p><p>For instance, at the beginning of the practice, when the mind connects with the constellations, constant visualization of the Celestial Demon form is required. Demon cultivators visualize their ancestors, solidifying their path. What should he visualize?</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had only seen the first four levels of *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>If his understanding was correct, these corresponded to the first four levels of cultivation: Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul.</p><p>The fourth level was already quite obscure and difficult, requiring careful comprehension. He wasn't sure if visualizing a random demon beast would trigger unforeseen consequences.</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of demonic script was rudimentary, barely enough to understand the text. His current understanding might be flawed, so he didn't dare to try it rashly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the rest of the scripture was shrouded in a fog, obscured from his view.</p><p>This suggested that the technique was complete, but his cultivation level was insufficient to penetrate the fog. This made it even harder for Qin Sang to abandon it.  *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* might lead beyond the Deity Transformation stage!</p><p>However, before deciding to cultivate *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, he needed to learn the demonic script and decipher the entire scripture. Otherwise, any unforeseen accident would leave him with regrets.</p><p>Regardless, *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* did give Qin Sang a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Since obtaining the *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter*, Qin Sang had seen countless cultivation techniques over the past century. Shaohua Mountain alone housed over a hundred, but few suited him aside from Wu Shang's Gangsha Pill Condensation and the Witch Clan's Native Insect Gu techniques.</p><p>Coupled with his limited talent, he couldn't afford to be distracted by other methods.</p><p>*Celestial Demon Body Refinement* might be another compatible technique, and it was a body refinement technique, which wouldn't conflict with the *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter*, allowing him to cultivate both simultaneously.</p><p>The reason these two techniques suited him so well was largely due to the Jade Buddha.</p><p>One could even say that his entire cultivation path was based on the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The significance of *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* didn't end there.</p><p>Due to the lack of information on the Ten Divine Woods, the Ebony Sword couldn't be upgraded, and Qin Sang's cultivation was constantly at risk of stagnation.</p><p>Without increasing his strength, he couldn't pass the Sword Path trial.  The Sword Path might lead to an ancient teleportation formation. Without finding it, he couldn't return to Xiaohan Realm, search for the Eternal Blood Mulberry, and the situation would become a stalemate.</p><p>Magical treasures and insect Gu would be sealed within the Sword Path. He could only rely on himself.</p><p>Body refinement was an excellent choice.</p><p>Cultivating both body and magic would more than double his strength.</p><p>He wouldn't need to reach the peak of the third level of *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* to possess the strength of a late-stage peak cultivator. This would give Qin Sang another path, temporarily freeing him from the arduous search for the Ten Divine Woods.</p><p>“I can find knowledgeable seniors on Tianxing Island to learn the demonic script and then study this technique carefully. There's no precedent, so I can only explore it on my own…”</p><p>Qin Sang put away the scripture and fiddled with the bone flute. A sudden flash of inspiration revealed something unusual.</p><p>Undoubtedly, both *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* and *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter* were top-tier techniques, even in ancient times, one for demons and the other for humans.</p><p>And both techniques shared a similar fate.</p><p>He had been transported to the Canglang Sea, obtaining both techniques by chance. Otherwise, the three bone flute fragments might never have reunited.</p><p>A chilling feeling crept over Qin Sang.</p><p>He had always harbored a question.  Both Xiaohan Realm and Canglang Sea held various legends of the ancient cultivation world, showcasing the power of ancient cultivators, including tales of ascension to immortality.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, late Nascent Soul cultivators were considered peak experts, Deity Transformation cultivators were nowhere to be seen, and higher realms existed only in legends.</p><p>The path to immortality was severed, and top-tier techniques were scattered.</p><p>Was all of this a coincidence?</p><p>Or was it orchestrated?</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head slightly, his thoughts swirling. But his cultivation was low, and his current primary goal was still to form his Nascent Soul. Excessive contemplation was futile.  On a positive note, if the *Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter*, like *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, was scattered rather than incomplete, he had a sliver of hope of gathering it.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>After seeing *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*, Qin Sang eagerly set off for Tianxing Island.</p><p>For the time being, he planned to live as a rogue cultivator, renting a cave dwelling on Tianxing Island. He had many things to do and needed to stay on the island to gather resources.</p><p>The Inner Sea was safer than the Demon Sea. Qin Sang flew alone, encountering no significant obstacles, and arrived near Tianxing Island.</p><p>He couldn't use the Qiongyu Trading Company manager's token anymore. Fortunately, he had anticipated this and created a false identity as a rogue cultivator, which he used in the Demon Sea for a while. It was time to put it to use.</p><p>The Canglang Sea was much larger than Xiaohan Realm, but since most of it was ocean, islands with spiritual veins were under the control of various factions.</p><p>After the truce between the righteous and demonic paths, they jointly controlled most of the sea, dividing it into four seas and establishing rules.</p><p>Even for factions outside the righteous and demonic paths, if their disciples revealed their identities when traveling, they would encounter fewer problems.</p>
