<h1>Chapter 912: The Shuttle</h1><p>Chapter 912: The Shuttle</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind, fully activating his cultivation technique.  He knew this was a process of using starlight to cleanse and transform his body, a painful ordeal that would ultimately lead to a powerful breakthrough.  </p><p>Afterwards, his physical body would be strong enough to withstand a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator!</p><p>His body was alternately wracked with pain and intense itching.  It felt like there wasn't a single inch of his body untouched. Skin split open, bones cracked. Blood seeped from the wounds, a dark, impure color, indicating that impurities were being purged during the starlight infusion.</p><p>Blood refinement, bone forging, sinew changing, marrow washing. Each word represented transformation, and excruciating pain.</p><p>"Ancient body-cultivation masters must have undergone similar transformations countless times to achieve the terrifying power to command heaven and earth. I'm only just beginning; what's there to give up?" Qin Sang silently mused.</p><p>He had reached this point through sheer perseverance, and wouldn't falter now, at this critical moment.</p><p>The starlight infusion continued.  Qin Sang cast aside distractions, concentrating fully on his cultivation technique, gathering the starlight, seeking the breakthrough.</p><p>After a while, the pillar of light slowly dissipated. The starlight drawn by the star platform receded like a tide.  The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Fatty Silkworm, and the Two-Headed… (creature name omitted) all paused their recovery, watching Qin Sang's breakthrough.</p><p>They were puzzled to see little apparent change in him.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly moved. He reached out, drawing forth the Green Mire Root and a Dominating Blood Fruit from a jade box, swallowing them immediately.</p><p>Dominating Blood Fruit, Green Mire Root, and Scorpion Venom Grass. He hadn’t managed to collect all three, but these herbs, even individually, would significantly aid his breakthrough.</p><p>The herbs entered his stomach, turning into a wave of burning heat.  Intense pain struck again. The Dominating Blood Fruit's potency was incredibly fierce; the Green Mire Root was slightly milder, but both erupted within his body. Unlike the starlight infusion which spread throughout his body, this concentrated impact would have been unbearable if Qin Sang hadn’t already cultivated the first two layers of *Heavenly Demon Body Tempering*.</p><p>His internal organs felt like they were shifting.</p><p>Qin Sang roared, straightening up sharply. His hands swiftly formed a hand seal, and a green light flashed behind him as a pair of phoenix wings abruptly unfolded.</p><p>Heavenly Demon Transformation activated, and Qin Sang's expression eased.</p><p>Moments later, a ceaseless flow of strange light surged from within him, fiercely pouring into his wings. The previously somewhat illusory wings became significantly more solid and even more magnificent, increasingly resembling real phoenix wings.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The wings beat, carrying Qin Sang away from the star platform.</p><p>Then, a series of explosions echoed from within Qin Sang’s body. His aura soared, wounds rapidly healing. Finally, a faint green glow flickered and vanished.</p><p>His body was as translucent as jade, flawless, yet brimming with terrifying power!</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head back and let out a long, joyous howl.  The echoing roar was deafening.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids fluttered, his eyes snapping open—his pupils were now a striking green. His body trembled, and the next moment he was at the edge of the restriction, unleashing a powerful punch.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A barrier shimmered into existence, the light blinding. The mountains shook, flocks of carrion vultures panicked and scattered.</p><p>A series of cracking sounds followed as several cracks appeared on the barrier, clearly on the verge of being shattered by Qin Sang's punch.</p><p>Seeing this…</p><p>The Two-Headed… (creature name omitted)’s eyes narrowed, fixated on Qin Sang’s wings.</p><p>The Fatty Silkworm lazily remained where it was, waiting to be fed.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, naturally delighted for its master, danced gracefully, flying onto Qin Sang’s shoulder, its wings gently brushing his cheek.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his fist, his movements fluid and precise.</p><p>"Although this restriction isn't particularly strong, it shouldn't be so easily broken.  Without using any spiritual energy, I caused such astonishing damage. After activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, just my physical body alone could suppress a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator, as expected of a top-tier demonic lineage," Qin Sang thought, filled with pleasant surprise.</p><p>"I just tested it—my escape technique has also improved dramatically."</p><p>He had taken two elixirs earlier to break through his cultivation bottleneck, increasing his chances of success.  A significant portion of their efficacy remained unrefined, accumulating within his body.  He needed to refine it quickly to further strengthen his physical form.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang stroked his Tianmu butterfly, checked on the condition of his two-headed… creatures, put away his Xingtai, made arrangements for them, then created a secluded chamber for himself and began cultivating.</p><p>…</p><p>Spring turned to autumn.  Years flew by.</p><p>For ordinary mortals, a decade is a significant portion of their lives, leaving behind countless indelible memories.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, spent these ten years in rigorous cultivation, single-minded and never leaving the Poison Island.</p><p>Other cultivators hadn’t noticed any abnormalities on the Poison Island, so he remained undisturbed, allowing him to focus on his cultivation.</p><p>During this decade, his cultivation and that of his external avatar steadily improved.</p><p>As the opening of the Seven Killing Hall approached, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of urgency.</p><p>Although he had anticipated it, after reaching the third level of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* and his external avatar forming a Golden Core, his cultivation speed slowed considerably compared to before.</p><p>At this rate, he might not meet the requirements for the Sword Path by the time the Seven Killing Hall opened.</p><p>The *Tian Yao Lian Xing* was manageable; breaking through to the mid-third level would be sufficient for his main body's strength.</p><p>His external avatar, however, posed a problem.  It would be difficult to raise its cultivation to peak Golden Core stage quickly, unless he risked backlash by using a forbidden, rapid-advancement technique.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, concluding that his own low cultivation base—only mid-Golden Core stage—was hindering his blood-feeding and body refinement techniques, resulting in a return to normal cultivation speed.</p><p>Two years ago, his *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* cultivation had stalled.  His subsequent findings relieved him.</p><p>It was as he had suspected.</p><p>His inability to progress stemmed from the Ebony Sword, not himself, so it wouldn't affect his continued comprehension of the killing talismans.  Once he obtained a top-tier spirit wood capable of withstanding the effects of the Endless Blood Mulberry, or returned to the Xiaohan region to find more Endless Blood Mulberries, his cultivation would rapidly improve.</p><p>This was undoubtedly good news, easing his anxiety.  At least he could wait until he entered the Seven Killing Hall and assessed the transmission array before considering switching cultivation techniques.</p><p>Besides, he hadn't found a technique suitable for him yet.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, pondering these matters.  Then, he seemed to sense something, looking towards the entrance of his cave.  After a moment, his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>Northern Poison Island.</p><p>In this sea area, dozens of large and small deserted islands clustered together, all uninhabited.</p><p>Due to the presence of Corrosive Winged Hawks and the barren nature of the region, cultivators rarely ventured near, opting to circumvent it even when passing by.</p><p>Yet, a blue shuttle was rapidly approaching.  For some reason, the shuttle was flying erratically and unsteadily, passing over several islands.  It seemed to be heading directly towards Poison Island.</p>
