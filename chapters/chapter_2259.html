<h1>Chapter 2249: Three Legacies</h1><p>The white smoke swirled before Qin Sang, sometimes gathering, sometimes dissipating.  He patiently watched until the smoke settled.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the image within the smoke, noticing a resemblance to the landscape painting on the bottle, yet with crucial differences in detail.</p><p>These differences were what made the impact of the image so vastly different!</p><p>The mountains formed by the smoke seemed vibrantly alive, the rivers flowed relentlessly, and deserts and badlands were also depicted – the entire scene was dynamic.</p><p>“It seems like a map?”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the miniature landscape, calculating its orientation.  He discovered that it pointed westward, outside Lingkong Mountain, between Lingkong Mountain and Yongtu Immortal City, leaning slightly more towards Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>The senior cultivator who left this clearly had exceptional power, traveling extensively.  Such strength would easily allow him to visit human territories, yet it was unclear why he hadn't left Lingkong Mountain, choosing instead to establish his cave abode in the Golden Eagle tribe's territory.</p><p>“What is that place? Another training ground of the senior cultivator, or the place where he obtained the ‘Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondences’?”</p><p>Various questions filled Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The smoke remained still. The double-eared porcelain bottle contained only this image, without any text. It seemed he would only discover the truth upon arriving at the location.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the stone-胎 fire. The smoke quivered and instantly vanished into the bottle, the image disappearing with it.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang used the stone-胎 fire to test the other treasures one by one, but to no avail. Only this double-eared porcelain bottle contained a message left by the senior cultivator.</p><p>With that settled, it was time to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang gathered all the treasures, gazed deeply at Lingkong Mountain to the east, and soared into the air.  He flew over towering mountains and rivers, finally descending by a riverbank.</p><p>This place was deep within the mountains, rarely visited by humans. Only the banks of this river were relatively flat, with a small human settlement.</p><p>It was clear these people lived a simple life, but it was peaceful. Surrounded by dense forests, the upstream and downstream river currents were exceptionally swift and the waterways complex, making boat travel impossible.  Access was only possible via mountain paths, shielding them from wars.</p><p>More importantly, from a cultivator's perspective, this place was extremely barren – too poor for the Golden Eagle tribe to bother occupying.</p><p>It was precisely this that the Transcendent Venerable had considered when he settled his blood relatives here before his departure – primarily Qin Sang's and Qing Yan's family. He intended to collect them later, but the increasingly tense situation prevented further entry into Golden Eagle territory.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose was to take these people away. If humans and demons were to go to war, the humans within demon territory might be caught in the crossfire.  Even though it was an illusion, it was still a connection. Of course, Qin Sang could only do so much; he couldn't help everyone else, even in reality he couldn't save the world, let alone now.</p><p>“Little brother?”</p><p>He saw his older brother again, now an elderly man of refined elegance. The Transcendent Venerable had provided for them, ensuring a comfortable life.</p><p>The brothers reminisced. Qin Sang learned that his parents had passed away, and his brother invited him to their graves for a memorial service, which Qin Sang accepted.</p><p>After the memorial service, Qin Sang summoned his flying boat, taking his relatives away, leaving their property to others.</p><p>The return journey was similar to the outbound trip. Qin Sang repeatedly used the Sky Demon Transformation to pass undetected, successfully leaving demon territory. He hired escorts to take his relatives to their sect, and then set off to find the place indicated on the map.</p><p>…</p><p>“What a desolate wasteland!”</p><p>Following the map, Qin Sang spent considerable effort finally pinpointing the final location.</p><p>However, upon arrival, the sight before him was unexpected.</p><p>It was a desolate, uninhabited mountain range.  The lack of water, coupled with the late autumn/winter season, resulted in withered vegetation, dead branches, and yellow leaves swirling in the wind.</p><p>The lack of food had driven away the birds and beasts, leaving a depressing atmosphere.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, his gaze settling on one particular mountain.</p><p>If his calculations were correct, this mountain was his destination, but it looked no different from its surroundings.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the summit, releasing his spiritual sense, and a look of understanding dawned on his face.</p><p>The smoke-formed landscape, beyond its directional guidance, held another secret.</p><p>Upon scanning the mountain with his spiritual sense and comparing it to the map, Qin Sang immediately understood. The map also concealed a method to activate a spirit formation.</p><p>However, this only unlocked part of the secret; the rest of the answers might lie within the formation!</p><p>Qin Sang flickered, appearing at a cave halfway down the mountain.</p><p>The cave was shallow, with scattered branches and fur, clearly a former animal den.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang swept his sleeve, brushing away the dust from the cave wall, and gently tapped a few spots on it.</p><p>A rumbling sound…</p><p>No grand spectacle erupted from the array, only a shower of small stones fell from the cave wall.  The next moment, Qin Sang found himself facing a smooth, grey-white stone wall, perfectly square.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the wall.  It wasn't a magical artifact nor a precious material. He tried to probe it with his spiritual sense, and suddenly felt a sucking force drawing his consciousness in.</p><p>His awareness drifted, surrounded by chaos, lost in an unknown place.  Gradually, his perception sharpened, filling him with surprise.</p><p>The surrounding scene was indescribable.  It was like being trapped in a complex puzzle. Qin Sang realized he could leave anytime, but to proceed, he had to solve the puzzle.</p><p>Simultaneously, he understood the final secret hidden within the landscape painting: it was the answer to this puzzle!</p><p>Instead of rushing to solve it, Qin Sang focused his mind, sensing intently, and soon noticed something.  The person who set this puzzle was undoubtedly a powerful cultivator proficient in Yin-Yang principles. The puzzle's foundation was Yin-Yang; only someone versed in this path could solve it.  Others would be completely lost.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Dao is vast and profound. Qin Sang realized this puzzle had a significant connection to the "Water-Fire Harmony" section of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*. To solve it, he needed to cultivate this section to a certain level!</p><p>The setter's intention was clear: only someone who had received the inheritance and possessed exceptional talent could solve the puzzle and open the wall.</p><p>Clearly, the senior cultivator who refined the double-eared porcelain vase had been here and provided his answer.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, deep in thought.  Then, following the information the senior left in the landscape painting, he attempted to solve the puzzle.</p><p>It proved to be the correct answer, yet the puzzle remained unsolved. Something was missing!</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, confirming his earlier suspicion: the senior cultivator hadn't solved the entire puzzle, stopping here.</p><p>The puzzle was related to the "Water-Fire Harmony" section of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*, but it was more than that.  Perhaps the ancient inheritance had been scattered, divided into several parts. The senior cultivator only obtained one part, thus only solving a portion of the puzzle.</p><p>At this thought, the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* came to mind.</p><p>"Could this be another part of the inheritance?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't truly cultivated the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun*, but he had studied it countless times on his journey and developed many ideas about the portion Jin Xiao had repaired.</p><p>After setting up a protective array, Qin Sang sat down and immediately began cultivating.</p><p>The *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* was easy to cultivate, but required persistence. After several cycles of cultivation, Qin Sang sensed the changes within himself, which were minimal, almost imperceptible.</p><p>However, with continued cultivation, his understanding of the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* deepened.  He began to drastically modify, almost completely rebuilding, Jin Xiao's repaired portion.</p><p>The cave offered no indication of the passage of day or night.</p><p>After an unknown time, Qin Sang awoke, his eyes shining with brilliance. He once again immersed his spiritual sense into the jade wall.</p><p>This time, he quickly confirmed that the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* was indeed part of the inheritance!</p><p>His understanding of the puzzle deepened.  It seemed to be divided into three levels, interwoven and inseparable.  The senior cultivator had solved the first level using the "Water-Fire Harmony" section of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*. The *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* was related to the second level, but even after solving these two, a third level remained.</p><p>This meant the inheritance was divided into at least three parts!</p><p>However, using only the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* to solve this level was extremely difficult. This could be due to the jade pendant's incompleteness, or perhaps the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun* was only a part of this inheritance.</p><p>Withdrawing his spiritual sense, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Three inheritances, and he possessed one and a half. The first level was solved by the senior cultivator, the second level had some hope, but the third remained a mystery.</p><p>Should he return empty-handed, waiting to gather all three inheritances before trying again?</p><p>Finding the remaining inheritances would not be easy.</p><p>Through soul-searching Jin Xiao, Qin Sang learned how he obtained the *Si Qi Diao Shen Lun*, but the clues ended there.</p><p>He could only hope, like with the double-eared vase, that there were crucial clues Jin Xiao overlooked.  But Jin Xiao had meticulously investigated every suspicious detail countless times; this possibility was slim.</p><p>There were absolutely no clues about the third inheritance; it was a matter of luck.</p><p>He didn't know when he'd gather all three inheritances. Even if he did, the contents of the stone wall might not be what he wanted. Wasting so much time and effort wasn't something Qin Sang desired.</p><p>Was there another way?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. His origins were unusual.  He appeared as a Nascent Soul cultivator, but possessed the knowledge and experience of a Transcendence cultivator.</p><p>Even the most intricate puzzle wouldn't go beyond the principles of Yin and Yang.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that during the past decade and a half, traveling to and from Lingkong Mountain and searching for treasures, Qin Sang diligently cultivated his skills. His mastery of the Water and Fire Harmony chapter is now approaching the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>His realm isn't high enough, not because of a lack of understanding, but because of limited time.  In truth, his vision is far beyond the ordinary. He had entered the Sun and Moon Hall, experienced the power of the Spring and Autumn Gnomon, and used it to understand the black and white pieces—a highly effective method, as he’d witnessed and experienced it firsthand.</p><p>Even a Lianxu cultivator dedicated to the Way of Yin and Yang might not have such experience.</p><p>As long as his memory remains, these experiences and insights are irreplaceable and might be the key to solving this puzzle!</p><p>After all, he only needs to 'solve the problem'.  By grasping the correct thread, he has a chance to trace it back to its source.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang closed his eyes, fully immersing his mind in the puzzle, like a fish swimming in a lake.</p><p>That senior not only helped Qin Sang solve the first puzzle but also pointed him towards a certain line of thinking.  Combining both, Qin Sang made rapid progress in understanding the second puzzle, soon getting a lead.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang devoted himself to the puzzle, constantly coming up with and discarding new ideas.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang felt the inconvenience of insufficient cultivation. The puzzle tested not only the entrant's talent; if he were a Nascent Soul cultivator now, it would have been much easier.</p><p>Despite the unfavorable conditions, Qin Sang successfully solved the second puzzle!</p><p>'Whew...'</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, his eyes showing fatigue as he regulated his breathing and recovered.</p><p>The third puzzle was the main event, with no guidance beyond the previous experience!</p><p>Before that, he had one more thing to do.</p><p>Qin Sang got up, left the mountain, and found a place rich in earth fire.  He built a furnace and reforged the water and fire pieces!</p><p>After the reforging, and having broken through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, Qin Sang returned to the cave, gazed at the stone wall for a long time, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Inside the stone wall.</p><p>The puzzle in Qin Sang's eyes transformed into a chessboard.  Two pieces, one red and one blue, moved on the board seemingly aimlessly, hesitant to make a move.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang had an inspiration.  The colors of the two pieces suddenly changed to black and white, lasting only a moment before returning to their original colors.</p><p>Instantly, the two pieces finally landed on the 'board'.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to hear the sound of the pieces landing. He then turned pale, 'Whoa!' and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Blood stained the stone wall. Qin Sang opened his eyes.</p><p>“Still too much of a stretch, it'll be safer after I break through to the Nascent Soul stage," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>However, the result was good!</p><p>A gleam of joy flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He had done it, finding the answer to the third puzzle without guidance from any heritage!</p><p>Now, all three puzzles were solved, and the secret behind the stone wall was about to be revealed.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, took a step forward, and passed through the stone wall without any obstruction.</p><p>Entering the interior of the stone wall, he saw an altar, resembling a place of worship, but without any portraits or statues, it was unknown whom it was dedicated to.</p><p>A skeleton sat cross-legged in front of the altar; the moment Qin Sang entered, the skeleton turned to dust.</p><p>On the altar, only a jade pendant was strikingly visible.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the place where the skeleton had been seated, took the pendant into his hand, and immediately sensed the information sealed within it – seemingly another map.</p><p>"This again?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, muttering inwardly.</p><p>Then, a voice came from the pendant. The voice was somewhat faint, as if left behind in dying breaths.</p><p>“Seeing this jade pendant means you solved my Jade Mechanism Three Restrictions, not forcing your way in.  Whether or not you relied on my inherited methods, it proves your exceptional talent. You are the successor I've been looking for! Next, simply follow the instructions on the pendant, enter the mountain gate, control the mountain gate formation, and you will obtain the mountain's heritage, becoming the master of Jade Mechanism Mountain…”</p><p>The voice abruptly stopped.</p>
