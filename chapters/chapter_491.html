<h1>Chapter 484: Demonic Core</h1><p>Yu Hua and the yellow-armored man's consciousness had just been erased by Qin Sang.</p><p>When refining the handsome young man, Qin Sang had accumulated some experience. Now, with two Core Formation cultivators before him, he was confident that he could succeed with at least one.</p><p>But this was not enough. Only if both were successful could his plan continue.</p><p>Qin Sang placed them on the ground, but didn't rush to act. Instead, he sat cross-legged, calming his mind and solidifying his cultivation.</p><p>He sat like this for two days.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, his pupils deep like a tranquil pool, without a trace of urgency or hesitation.</p><p>His calm gaze swept over Yu Hua and landed on the yellow-armored man.</p><p>Five elemental Yin objects flew out from the Corpse Puppet Pouch and lined up in front of Qin Sang. The yellow-armored man cultivated metal-attribute techniques, so Qin Sang reached out and grabbed a piece of Blue Nethergold.</p><p>He had prepared many Yin objects. The Blue Nethergold alone had four large pieces, which would be more than enough to refine four living corpses.</p><p>The Blue Nethergold melted in Qin Sang's palm, turning into a small mass of blue liquid, looking very viscous and remaining tightly condensed. Even when Qin Sang released his spiritual power, it did not flow around.</p><p>After removing the few impurities from the Blue Nethergold, Qin Sang infused the pure liquid into the yellow-armored man's dantian, followed by the Yin Spirit Water, of which he still had several bottles.</p><p>…</p><p>While infusing the Yin objects into the yellow-armored man's body, Qin Sang continuously changed countless hand seals, completing the corpse refinement restrictions step by step. He focused intently on each step, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>Soon, the foundation building with the five elemental Yin objects was successfully completed!</p><p>From the outside, there was no change in the yellow-armored man.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, but his expression became more serious. The next step was the main event: introducing Earthly Yin Qi into the body and transforming the yellow-armored man into a true living corpse!</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The Earthly Yin Qi surged in the abyss. Qin Sang drew a wisp towards him.</p><p>It was a very small wisp, yet it was incredibly violent. Qin Sang used all his strength to suppress it, and only after it calmed down did he begin to introduce it into the yellow-armored man's body.</p><p>Instead, he spread his divine sense, examining the yellow-armored man from head to toe countless times, especially the dantian area. Qin Sang made sure he understood every tiny change before proceeding.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>The first attempt failed.</p><p>But Qin Sang was already experienced. Before the spiritual power in the yellow-armored man's dantian could erupt, he withdrew the wisp of Earthly Yin Qi, then condensed a new one and tried again.</p><p>Failure after failure.</p><p>Finally, the first wisp of Earthly Yin Qi successfully integrated into the yellow-armored man's dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly completed a hand seal. His divine sense swept over the yellow-armored man's dantian.  Within the spiritual power, there was a black aura, appearing so abrupt and incongruous, yet coexisting peacefully.</p><p>This was just the beginning; it was too early to celebrate.</p><p>Back at Finger Peak, during the refinement of the handsome young man, an unexpected change occurred when the second wisp of Earthly Yin Qi entered the body, causing the entire process to fail.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was no longer the same, and he was prepared, so he wasn't flustered and steadily continued to the next step.</p><p>The second wisp!</p><p>The third wisp!</p><p>…</p><p>As time went on, the Earthly Yin Qi within the yellow-armored man's body grew increasingly abundant.</p><p>Each attempt had at least a ninety percent chance of failure, yet Qin Sang showed no sign of discouragement, for failure was nothing compared to the biggest danger: instability in the yellow-armored man’s dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind remained tense, never pushing his luck. Indeed, a few dangerous situations arose at the beginning, but Qin Sang resolved them in time, stumbling through the process.</p><p>Inside the dark cave.</p><p>Besides the surging Earthly Yin Qi, there was no other sound.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously attempted to introduce Earthly Yin Qi into the yellow-armored man's body, while simultaneously completing complex hand seals at an increasing speed.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Another wisp of Earthly Yin Qi entered the body. The yellow-armored man's dantian was in turmoil, but finally calmed down. Qin Sang's eyes widened, and a rare flicker of emotion appeared in his usually calm gaze.</p><p>At this moment, his movements suddenly became several times faster, dazzlingly so. One complex hand seal after another flew out, landing on the yellow-armored man.</p><p>"Merge!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly shouted in a low voice, his palm seemingly slow but actually swift, gently pressing on the yellow-armored man's dantian.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A terrifying storm erupted within the yellow-armored man's dantian, a silent but powerful tremor!</p><p>The yellow-armored man's body trembled, the amplitude increasing. The hard barrier constructed by the five elemental Yin objects began to shake, and the restrictions on his body also showed signs of collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious as he frantically channeled spiritual power into the yellow-armored man's body through his palm.</p><p>The storm intensified.</p><p>An incredibly sharp backlash came from the yellow-armored man's dantian, beginning to counter Qin Sang, but he never moved his palm, gritting his teeth and persevering.</p><p>Finally, the storm reached a peak and abruptly stopped.</p><p>The yellow-armored man stood motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang was a bit surprised. He hurriedly urged his divine sense into the yellow-armored man's dantian and discovered that it had stabilized, with the Earthly Yin Qi and the man's spiritual power coexisting peacefully.</p><p>With Qin Sang's thought, the Earthly Yin Qi and spiritual power each separated a strand, merged, and flowed calmly through his meridians.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, his tense mind finally relaxing. Only then did he realize that his own body was somewhat depleted. Refining this living corpse had consumed a surprisingly large amount of energy.</p><p>With this success, Qin Sang's confidence grew even stronger.</p><p>He tested the yellow-armored man's strength, then stored him in the Corpse Puppet Pouch.  He circulated his cultivation technique to recover to his peak state and then summoned Yu Hua.</p><p>…</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>A figure flashed out of the entrance of the Earth Sink Cave. After checking the direction, it headed south, entering the Cloudmist Great Marsh.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's strong mental fortitude, a hint of excitement could be seen on his face.</p><p>Two living corpses, the yellow-armored man and Yu Hua.  The refinement process was not without its dangers, but he had resolved them all in time, and both refinements were successful!</p><p>At this time, dark clouds covered the Cloudmist Great Marsh, and a drizzling rain fell, but Qin Sang didn't feel the slightest bit oppressed.</p><p>He rode the clouds at full speed, impatiently flying towards the Chaotic Islands.</p><p>He traveled non-stop, finally seeing the sea of mist formed by the Thousand Illusions Formation on the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, quietly entered the formation, transformed into a masked figure in black robes, and headed straight for Mist Island.</p><p>Manager Bao, the exceptionally obese man, his face immediately creased into a wide smile upon seeing Qin Sang. He personally led Qin Sang towards the quiet room, and on the way, he couldn't help but lower his voice and ask, "Fellow Daoist, you've made this Bao wait quite a while! These past few days, I haven't been able to eat or sleep, and even meditation has been impossible. I've lost several pounds, just waiting for your news… What's the result?"</p><p>Manager Bao stared expectantly at Qin Sang, seemingly afraid of hearing bad news.</p><p>This guy is really obsessed with living corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, chuckling softly. He said calmly, "Manager Bao, have you prepared the Demonic Core?"</p>
