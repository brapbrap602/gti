<h1>Chapter 459: The Peachwood Carving</h1><p>“After returning from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, I saw the message talisman you left, Senior. I went to Moonask坊市 to apologize, only to learn you had already left.  Later, I met Fellow Daoist Le Xing, but she also had no news of you. I've participated in almost every major battle and never encountered you. Had I known you were in the Chaotic Isles, I would have paid you a visit first…”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke with a hint of regret, his expression calm and collected.</p><p>Granny Jing looked at Qin Sang intently, her voice raspy. “Fellow Daoist Qin, you are remarkably composed. Such a strong mind… No wonder you've come this far, reached your current cultivation level, and earned the title of 'Shadowless Sword'.”</p><p>What did she mean?</p><p>Qin Sang felt Granny Jing’s words carried a hidden meaning, and he was puzzled.</p><p>Before he could ask, Granny Jing’s tone shifted. “For the past three years, I have indeed been in the Chaotic Isles. However, I chose to remain hidden, so you naturally wouldn't have seen me.”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Granny Jing’s answer was unexpected.</p><p>Hidden in the Chaotic Isles for three years, undetected.</p><p>The islands were protected by the powerful Truewater Mirage Formation.  Without a blood-linked token, no one could enter or leave, not even Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Inside, on Stargazer Island, Core Formation experts from various sects were stationed, including peak late-Core Formation masters like Serpent Lady and Vice-Island Master Xiao.</p><p>Even they hadn't discovered Granny Jing.</p><p>Was her power greater than the two Island Masters of Stargazer Island?</p><p>Could it be…?</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  He composed himself and bowed. “Senior, you've suddenly revealed yourself and sought me out. There must be a reason. What can this unworthy junior do for you?”</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>Granny Jing’s laughter was peculiar. “Since Fellow Daoist Qin asks, I'll be frank.  I've been lying in wait here for three years, waiting for Heavenpointing Peak to emerge.”</p><p>“Heavenpointing Peak?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly. He suddenly realized Granny Jing’s purpose and gasped. “Could it be you want to…”</p><p>Granny Jing nodded.  “Indeed. I have urgent business within Heavenpointing Peak. However, the Celestial Alliance and the Small Cold Realm are closely guarding it. I cannot enter alone and need assistance. Fellow Daoist Qin, having just returned from Stargazer Island, you should have qualified to enter Heavenpointing Peak, haven't you?”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a noncommittal hum.</p><p>“Good,” Granny Jing said.  “I had anticipated a more complicated process, but your outstanding performance simplifies matters. I will transform into a wooden carving. You simply need to carry it, and I can enter Heavenpointing Peak with you.”</p><p>As she spoke, Granny Jing opened her palm, revealing a small, exquisite peachwood carving.</p><p>The carving depicted a woman, her eyes bright and lively, incredibly lifelike.</p><p>Were it life-sized, one might mistake it for a real person.</p><p>Strangely, the woman was not Granny Jing but a young woman of breathtaking, otherworldly beauty, the likes of which Qin Sang had never seen.</p><p>For a lifeless carving to possess such charm, the real person must be no less stunning than Fairy Chen Yan.</p><p>Had he not seen Fairy Chen Yan with his own eyes, Qin Sang would have been captivated by the carving.</p><p>He glanced at it, hesitant to refuse outright. After a moment, he said, “Senior, you may not be aware, but I just learned from Vice-Island Master Xiao that the restrictions within Heavenpointing Peak are unique. The space is extremely fragile. Cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage cannot enter, otherwise…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Granny Jing interrupted.</p><p>“If I dare enter Heavenpointing Peak, I've naturally investigated thoroughly. Rest assured, I will suppress my cultivation to the Foundation Establishment level. I won’t exceed the Peak’s limits.”</p><p>So, Granny Jing was at least a Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened. He opened his mouth, wanting to say more.</p><p>Granny Jing smiled faintly, her cloudy eyes studying Qin Sang’s face. “Fellow Daoist Qin, on the verge of Core Formation, you wouldn't want to miss the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower offered by Stargazer Island, would you?”</p><p>“You also know about…”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. His expression shifted, his gaze flickering as he fixed his eyes on Granny Jing. “What do you mean, Senior?”</p><p>Granny Jing nodded slightly, her tone tinged with disdain.</p><p>“I not only know the rewards offered by Stargazer Island, but I also know you each received a Spirit-Locking Bracelet.</p><p>“Little do they know, using the bracelet to collect Star Essence Stones limits you to one at a time, and its efficiency is abysmal.</p><p>“I possess a Star Essence Net, a magical tool remarkably effective on peculiar objects like Star Essence Stones, far surpassing the Spirit-Locking Bracelet.</p><p>“I can promise to help you gather enough Star Essence Stones to ensure you outperform the others. However, I have one condition. After obtaining sufficient Star Essence Stones, you must accompany me to a specific location within Heavenpointing Peak.</p><p>“As you just worried, I must fully suppress my cultivation and cannot move freely within the Peak. I must rely on Fellow Daoist Qin.</p><p>“What do you say…</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Granny Jing’s voice was laced with enticement. As she spoke, she produced a tangled mass of shimmering, starlit threads.</p><p>The threads were a chaotic jumble of unknown material.</p><p>As Granny Jing gently shook them, they unfurled into a large net, floating in the air.</p><p>Even without Granny Jing's explanation, Qin Sang could tell.</p><p>The Star Essence Net’s quality far surpassed the Spirit-Locking Bracelet. The two magical tools seemed related, but the net’s effects were clearly not as limited as the bracelet's.</p><p>Granny Jing’s words were highly likely true!</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus!</p><p>The Iris Flower!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, forcing his gaze away from the Star Essence Net.</p><p>It seemed that by agreeing to Granny Jing’s terms, these two spiritual herbs would be within his grasp.</p><p>It was impossible to be unmoved. Qin Sang almost agreed immediately, but his reason held him back.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s silence, Granny Jing showed no impatience. She calmly asked, “What’s wrong, Fellow Daoist Qin? Do you perhaps not value the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile.  “What Foundation Establishment cultivator could resist their allure? I almost couldn’t contain myself, but I have one more concern… Senior, residing within the wooden carving, can you truly deceive everyone?”</p><p>Before Granny Jing could answer, Qin Sang added,</p><p>“Were you present at last night's battle, Senior?</p><p>“Several Nascent Soul Grand Masters arrived, finally bringing an end to the fighting.</p><p>“I inquired with fellow Daoists and learned that one of the red-haired elders was the Sect Master of the Pure Yang Sect, the current strongest cultivator in the world!</p><p>“For three whole years, it was the first time I witnessed a Nascent Soul Grand Master, and it coincided with Heavenpointing Peak's emergence.</p><p>“Was it merely a coincidence?</p><p>“I don't know if the Nascent Soul Grand Masters from both sides will personally attend when Heavenpointing Peak opens.</p><p>“But I dare not gamble!</p><p>“If I disappoint you, Senior, I can at most apologize with my death.</p><p>“However, if your concealment is discovered by a Nascent Soul Grand Master, you might escape, but I will certainly be branded a traitor and suffer a fate worse than death!”</p>
