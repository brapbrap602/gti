<h1>Chapter 1662: Heavenly Dragon's Chant</h1><p>Death Seal, Heavenly Thunder, Magnetic Light.</p><p>Any one of these three attacks would likely kill an ordinary Yuan Ying cultivator instantly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had reached the pinnacle of body refinement.  In the Nine-Earth Magnetic Divine Light, a cultivator's techniques are far more restricted than his. Many magical treasures and abilities either become unusable or are deflected by the Nine-Earth Magnetic force, greatly reducing their power.</p><p>He dared to seize the treasure while enduring the Death Seal and Heavenly Thunder, naturally possessing immense confidence in his ability to handle any situation.</p><p>However, he didn't expect a third person lurking, hidden so perfectly.</p><p>With all three attacks striking him, even Master Huaiyin's Arhat Golden Body, though strong, couldn't withstand it; it shattered instantly. Kun Dao had been waiting for this opportunity and seized it, striking decisively!</p><p>Feeling the sticky blood on her palm, Kun Dao smiled.</p><p>In Kun Dao's eyes, Master Huaiyin's vigorous blood was more alluring than a Yuan Ying cultivator's.</p><p>But Kun Dao's triumph was short-lived. The prey didn't lose its fighting ability and die as she expected.</p><p>At this moment, Kun Dao had already channeled the Magnetic Light into Master Huaiyin's wound, intending to detonate it and completely destroy his internal organs.</p><p>"What fiend dares attack me!"</p><p>A furious roar suddenly resounded.</p><p>The roar held a soul-stirring power.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Dragon's Chant, a secret and forbidden technique of Buddhism.  The sound of the chant was like thunder, capable of subduing enemies. Used by Master Huaiyin, enhanced by his blood energy, its power was especially terrifying.</p><p>Anyone with weak resolve would have their soul tremble and be terrified.</p><p>Kun Dao stiffened slightly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, at some point, had turned to face Kun Dao, chanting sutras, his eyes blazing with Buddha's light intensified by rage, his killing intent shocking.</p><p>At this moment, Master Huaiyin was surrounded by a brilliant Buddha light.  His shattered Arhat Golden Body didn't dissipate; its fragments recombined, reforming into a blood-energy golden dragon to empower his Heavenly Dragon's Chant.</p><p>The blood-energy golden dragon merged with the chant, forming sound waves that were as substantial as tangible objects.</p><p>Master Huaiyin himself was weak and near death.  His golden body was shattered, his internal organs damaged, and he was severely injured.  Using the Heavenly Dragon's Chant in this state, further depleting his blood energy, left him at his wits' end.</p><p>The chant clearly couldn't subdue Kun Dao; it could only buy him a brief moment to breathe.</p><p>In this situation, Master Huaiyin's outstretched right hand, still grasping for the treasure fragment, didn't retract. His left hand returned to his chest.</p><p>His fingers curled inward, forming a hand seal.</p><p>Kun Dao shook off the impact of the chant, seeing that Master Huaiyin was still coveting the treasure, thought him foolish to the point of death. She was about to kill him when she felt the arm inserted into his body suddenly clamped tight.</p><p>An astonishing force erupted from Master Huaiyin's body, forcing all the Nine-Earth Magnetic Divine Light back into her.</p><p>Kun Dao felt the Nine-Earth Magnetic Divine Light compressed around her palm, unable to harm Master Huaiyin. Furthermore, the force grew stronger, threatening to throw her away.</p><p>Even more shockingly, Master Huaiyin, who was nearly dead, had a golden light flowing from his hand seal across his skin, and his energy visibly increased.</p><p>This golden light emanated from Master Huaiyin's hand seal.</p><p>As the golden light spread, it was as if the situation had turned completely around.  Master Huaiyin's meridians resonated with rolling thunder, his complexion recovered, and his blood-energy golden dragon reformed, his Arhat Golden Body reappearing!</p><p>In an instant, Master Huaiyin was almost back to his peak condition. Except for the shocking wound on his back, no one would have guessed he had been severely injured, nearly killed.</p><p>"Fiend, die!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin roared again.</p><p>This roar wasn't the Heavenly Dragon's Chant, but his voice was full of energy.</p><p>His Arhat Golden Body lowered its head, delivering a palm strike to Kun Dao's head.  The Arhat arm was surrounded by a golden dragon, generating concentric golden ripples and creating an astonishing storm that scattered the Magnetic Light and seemed to shatter the void.</p><p>Kun Dao was at the center of the storm, her wrist still stuck in Master Huaiyin's wound. If she didn't retreat, she would receive the full force of the Arhat's blow.</p><p>In less than a breath, the situation had changed drastically, dazzlingly fast.</p><p>Kun Dao's surprise attack nearly killed Master Huaiyin, but the situation then turned completely upside down.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were both astonished.  Astonished by the sudden, stealthy attack, and astonished by Master Huaiyin's powerful abilities.</p><p>The attacker's concealment was perfect, and their timing impeccable, clearly a premeditated ambush.  They themselves might not have escaped unscathed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill of fear. If the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't warned him, he would have been the target. Master Huaiyin had taken the blow for him.</p><p>A thought flashed, and his Celestial Eye pierced the Nine-Origin Magnetic Divine Light.  Qin Sang saw the woman's attire, and his gaze was immediately drawn to something at her waist.</p><p>It was a fiery red jade pendant, its interior seeming to hold flowing magma; identical to the pendant seen in the Ice Instrument Palace's tribulation vision. The Fire Jade Centipede's reaction confirmed that it was the pendant that attracted it.</p><p>"Crimson Immortal Pendant!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his eyes shining brightly.  His thoughts surged, and without hesitation, he cast the Thunder Sound and Soul Capture incantations again.</p><p>He had planned this. The attack was identical to the previous one, only the target was now the woman.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, having come from the Western Lands, had few enemies in Central Plains. The woman's immediate attack showed her to be a ruthless killer. She had spied on him several times, clearly with malicious intent. Even without the Crimson Immortal Pendant, Qin Sang wouldn't have shown mercy.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang was trying to deduce the woman's origins. He had never seen her since entering the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, and the remnant soul of the Crying Spirit Cave Master had no relevant memory.</p><p>However, the woman's actions pointed towards a certain conclusion.  Qin Sang was certain that the Star Pavilion explosion and the emergence of the ancient cultivator's treasure were her doing.</p><p>She could use the divine prohibition to hide and manipulate the Nine-Origin Magnetic Divine Light, but her control must be limited; otherwise, she wouldn't need to set up elaborate schemes, she could simply control the divine prohibition and cause everyone to fear for their lives.</p><p>"Is she an accomplice of Zhu Wu Dao?" Qin Sang considered a possibility.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao had gathered a group of demons and monsters, keeping something back from Crying Spirit Cave Master and the others, guarding against betrayal – that was normal.  Furthermore, Crying Spirit Cave Master's memories included Zhu Wu Dao mentioning many Wuxiang Immortal Gate descendants hiding in the shadows, some watching them, constantly hunted by other factions, living in fear, unable to reveal their identities.</p><p>Now that the Wuxiang Immortal Gate's legacy estate had appeared, those factions must be restless. These people possessed treasures of the Wuxiang Immortal Gate's heritage, allowing them to freely enter and leave Emperor Mandate Mountain – that wasn't surprising either.</p><p>In an instant, various ideas flowed through his mind, without affecting Qin Sang's judgment or actions.</p><p>As he attacked, Qin Sang reversed his retreat, his phoenix wings beating once, leaving a black trail of fire in the void as he counter-attacked.</p><p>As Qin Sang pressed forward, Master Huaiyin, multitasking, reached into the cluster of debris with his other hand.</p><p>Before the attack, Master Huaiyin had intended to take all the treasures.  The Poison King was soon to arrive, and even after resisting an attack from Qin Sang and Su Zinan, he could have still retreated safely.  If the female cultivator's belongings held information about Emperor Mandate Mountain, it could be useful when confronting the grotesque-faced person.</p><p>Although he had obtained the even more valuable Xinjin Source Crystal, sufficient to replace the spiritual object he was seeking, his agreement with the Poison King still stood; and the opportunity was partly due to the Poison King, he couldn't simply break his promise.</p><p>Now seriously injured, Master Huaiyin dared not be careless; he had to make choices.</p><p>Master Huaiyin gathered the golden light in his palm, taking only the Xinjin Source Crystal, his arm vibrating powerfully, sending the other treasures flying away to avoid further attacks.</p><p>Some treasures were destroyed in the explosion. Only a few remained.  Among them were four swords: two long swords – one originally lying on the woman's lap, likely her own – and two finger-sized swords, one gold and one jade.  The small swords lacked scabbards and resembled sword talismans. There was also a black jade box, sealed, with flickering light, obviously due to the intense impact.</p><p>Qin Sang was focused on the pendant at the woman's waist, glancing at the treasures but not changing his target.  Su Zinan, however, lacked the Celestial Eye Butterfly's keen sight; his vision and perception were blocked by the Nine-Origin Magnetic Divine Light around Master Huaiyin, only seeing the woman's blurry figure and not yet noticing the pendant.</p><p>While still uncertain, he saw Master Huaiyin send the treasures flying, and his expression shifted.  Su Zinan moved rapidly, closing in, gathering the remaining power of his death seal, aiming for the woman. His thoughts mirrored Qin Sang's; the woman’s origins were unclear, she was a valuable asset, best taken alive.</p><p>Su Zinan, however, was more interested in seizing the opportunity, seemingly aiming for the treasures.  A faint mist constantly surrounded him, a manifestation of the two main soul powers of the magic banner, countering the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field. As long as the main souls remained attached to him, his identity would remain hidden. Even the Sky-Eyed Butterfly didn't notice anything amiss, mistaking it for a protective treasure.</p><p>In an instant, the four forces converged, and a chaotic battle was about to erupt.  Another heavenly thunderbolt struck.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instinctively defended, unexpectedly finding that it was aimed directly at Kun Dao.  Unable to fathom Qin Sang's sudden assistance, he decided not to ponder it further.  His golden Arhat palm descended, generating a thick golden gale.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Kun Dao, caught in the crossfire of the thunderbolt and the Buddha's palm, appeared exceptionally vulnerable. The Dragon Chant and Soul-Subduing Incantation that followed sent tremors through her mind.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang summoned the Solar God Tree.  Within the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field's radiance, the Solar God Bird was easily prone to losing control and veering off course. He had to wait until he was closer before attacking.</p><p>Though seemingly complicated, Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin reacted swiftly, leaving Kun Dao virtually no room to maneuver.  It seemed Kun Dao was about to be struck down.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang saw Kun Dao retract her arm, spread it wide, close her eyes, and open her mouth, letting out a shrill, ear-splitting scream.  The piercing sound, even through the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, felt like needles piercing Qin Sang's eardrums.</p><p>Outside the battlefield,</p><p>The Poison King was rapidly approaching.  He faintly heard the woman's scream and his expression turned grave.  Master Huaiyin's two furious shouts, combined with this scream, indicated an unforeseen change.  The Poison King had faith in Master Huaiyin's abilities, but these sounds made him uneasy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was not adept at dealing with the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, so he fell behind.</p><p>Upon realizing this, the Poison King, without hesitation, flicked his sleeve, muttering incantations, and extended his index finger. A black thread shot out from his sleeve. He brushed the thread with his finger, swirling up a black demonic wind that pierced through layers of the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, rushing towards the battlefield.</p><p>The Poison King's gaze was heavy, his speed noticeably slower as he mentally controlled his insect gu.</p><p>Hearing the scream, Qin Sang sensed danger, and immediately saw the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field's radiance around Kun Dao violently converging into a yellow and black pillar of light, shooting upwards to meet the Arhat's giant palm.</p><p>Alas, Kun Dao's hasty action was imperfect; the protective Nine Yuan Magnetic Field became thin, unable to withstand the thunderbolt and the death seal.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Amidst the thunderclap, the giant palm was obstructed, but the thunderbolt and the death seal pierced the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, striking Kun Dao almost simultaneously.</p><p>Surprisingly, Kun Dao did not perish instantly from these two attacks; her injuries were far less severe than Qin Sang anticipated.  A grayish mist had appeared on Kun Dao's body, a chaotic-looking mist incongruous with the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field's radiance.</p><p>As Kun Dao screamed, the mist swelled rapidly.  At the same time, the space around her began to tremble and become unstable; the surrounding Nine Yuan Magnetic Field shattered. Master Huaiyin's expression turned serious, sensing danger.  He was already struggling to maintain his secret technique, and was prepared to retreat once he obtained the Xinjin Yuanjing.  Seeing Kun Dao pushed back, he made a decisive retreat.</p><p>Kun Dao's shoulder, struck by lightning, was ripped open, her blood vaporized by the electric force.  Her chest was hit by the death seal; a clear "death" character was imprinted on her body, and her essence blood was drawn towards the seal by an unknown force.</p><p>Yet, none of these proved fatal, seemingly blocked by the mist.  As space and divine prohibitions shuddered, Kun Dao's figure became increasingly ethereal.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood immediately: Kun Dao was escaping!  To his disappointment, Master Huaiyin chose to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm, the Solar God Tree reappeared, slowly rotating in his palm, its three divine birds poised to take flight.</p><p>However, Kun Dao acted faster; the mist, like a boundless ocean, surged from an unknown space.  Wherever it passed, the void cracked, revealing fissures.</p><p>The three knew this was not a void rift, but gaps in the divine prohibitions.  The other side of the fissure should be the exit, the one they had been desperately searching for, but none of them wanted to enter it now.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>The fissures spread rapidly, soon encircling Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Su Zinan finally saw Kun Dao's face, his eyes widening: "Fire Rhinoceros!"</p><p>He finally understood why Qin Sang had acted decisively against Kun Dao—he was attracted by this treasure. Without hesitation, he lunged towards Kun Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan advanced, but Master Huaiyin did the opposite, retreating continuously, without any lingering attachment.</p><p>Just then, a strange hissing wind came from a distance, a demonic wind rushing towards them, with thin black threads faintly visible within it.</p><p>The Poison King had finally arrived!</p><p>Master Huaiyin's mind relaxed; he hurriedly rushed towards the demonic wind and saw the Poison King following behind.</p><p>"Master..."</p><p>Seeing Master Huaiyin's wounds, the Poison King was shocked.</p><p>Master Huaiyin let out a soft breath, his breathing ragged, and sighed, "I'm afraid I can't continue accompanying you, friend."</p>
