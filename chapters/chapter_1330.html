<h1>Chapter 1322: Ten Years of Study</h1><p>Chapter 1322: Ten Years of Study</p><p>The fire spirit sensed the aura of the spirit fire and instinctively felt fear.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Ancestor Saint Fire were both higher-order existences than the flame that birthed it.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, in particular, exerted the most significant pressure on its rank, causing the fire spirit to tremble and be terrified to the extreme, unable to resist.</p><p>Bing Han seized the opportunity to accelerate.</p><p>Simultaneously, she gently patted her storage pouch, and dozens of streams of light soared into the sky.</p><p>Each stream of light contained a type of spirit material.</p><p>Refining a spiritual treasure wasn't something a mere fire spirit could accomplish.  The Xu Ling Sect had been planning this since its first ancestor, with countless generations of cultivators devoting untold effort to gather these materials.</p><p>At this point, Bing Han had only one chance and couldn't afford any mistakes.</p><p>Her expression remained calm as she used her spiritual sense to guide various spiritual objects into the square cauldron, refining them one by one, removing impurities, and incorporating the most essential parts into the fire jade.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Ancestor Saint Fire, working in conjunction with the spirit array, significantly suppressed the fire spirit.</p><p>The fire jade was changing at a visible rate.</p><p>Originally a pure blue, it gradually took on a crimson hue after the incorporation of various spirit materials. Furthermore, the fire jade's shape was also changing, its body elongating at both ends, gradually taking on the outline of a blade.</p><p>Everything went smoothly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing's vigilance eased slightly, captivated by Bing Han's refining techniques, and carefully observed.</p><p>Bing Han's expression also became increasingly relaxed.</p><p>As she was about to inscribe the final runes, the spiritual embryo was about to take shape.</p><p>A sudden change occurred!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The mountain trembled violently.</p><p>The power of the subterranean fire vein surged incredibly fiercely, violently impacting them. The fire spirit felt death approaching and its survival instinct overcame its fear, leading it to fight to the death!</p><p>Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>The sect's protective formation had already been activated by Bing Han, and all disciples were ordered to remain within the sect grounds, forbidden from going out.</p><p>The forbidden area's upheaval caused the entire sect to shake, like a dragon turning over.</p><p>Xu Ling Sect disciples rushed out of their caves, their faces showing surprise.  There had been tremors in the Xu Ling Sect for some time, but this one was unprecedentedly violent.</p><p>The source seemed to be the forbidden area.</p><p>Yun Lan and several other Golden Core cultivators were ordered to guard the foot of the mountain. Seeing the disciples gathering towards the forbidden area, they shouted to stop them.</p><p>Concern showed on their faces, but they were unclear about the cause.  They only knew that the sect master had invited two Yuan Ying experts, indicating that this matter was undoubtedly extraordinary!</p><p>As for the forbidden area's interior.</p><p>The three reacted quickly.</p><p>Upon discovering the fire spirit's unusual movement, Qin Sang and Xiang Qing, without hesitation, exerted all their strength to activate the spirit fire, forcibly stabilizing the jade cauldron, and taking the brunt of the fire vein's impact for Bing Han.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned pale, fire poison invading his body.</p><p>But he completely ignored it, his gaze fixed on the jade cauldron. He found that the fluctuation was too violent, and Bing Han had also suffered the impact.</p><p>‘Dong! Dong!’</p><p>The fire jade violently struck against the jade cauldron.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darkened, his spiritual sense activating the corpse puppet pouch; the Yuan Ying spirit puppet seal was released, flashing out to block behind Qin Sang, shielding him from the impact.</p><p>The sudden appearance of an extra person startled both Xiang Qing and Bing Han.</p><p>Then, they discovered that it was a Yuan Ying-level puppet, their surprise even greater.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his early Yuan Ying cultivation, had shone brightly on the battlefield.</p><p>Who would have thought that he was secretly concealing a Yuan Ying spirit puppet!</p><p>Xiang Qing was astonished, giving Qin Sang a deep look, thankful that he had not made an enemy of this person.</p><p>Regardless of their thoughts, Qin Sang, having released the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, felt the pressure on him lessen.  He immediately used the newly learned refining technique to help Bing Han stabilize the jade cauldron and jointly refine the fire jade.</p><p>His willingness to reveal his Yuan Ying spirit puppet, naturally, had its own calculations.</p><p>The spiritual embryo's shaping is the most crucial step; only through personal involvement could one understand its intricacies. Bing Han would certainly not let them interfere unless absolutely necessary, and now there was no reason to refuse.</p><p>Indeed, Bing Han glanced at Qin Sang, remained silent, and tacitly accepted his actions.</p><p>With the two of them working together, the fire spirit's final resistance was suppressed.</p><p>The square cauldron gradually calmed down.</p><p>The fire jade's ever-changing form stabilized, finally transforming into a three-inch jade blade.</p><p>The spiritual embryo was refined!</p><p>‘Whew!’</p><p>The three of them simultaneously breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Qin Sang felt pain all over his body. The fire poison invading his body would likely take some time to clear, and his Yuan Ying spirit puppet was also damaged.</p><p>These costs were worthwhile!</p><p>Thinking of the gains just now, Qin Sang's eyes shone brightly.</p><p>It was equivalent to him personally refining a spiritual treasure embryo—an experience impossible to obtain from books!</p><p>Xiang Qing looked somewhat weak, having been injured again after just recovering.</p><p>However, Xiang Qing didn't immediately check himself; his attention was caught by the spirit body puppet behind Qin Sang. The talisman had been transformed into a puppet seal.  Even if Xiang Qing racked his brains, he couldn't connect it to the spirit body puppets of the Upper Yuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, you've kept this very well hidden," Xiang Qing exclaimed sincerely.</p><p>In the Fire Spring, the jade blade floated quietly within the jade cauldron. Bing Han reached out a finger, gently caressing the blade. Gradually, the jade blade was enveloped by the flames, forming a fiery cocoon.  If refined now, this treasure would undoubtedly become another top-grade magic weapon, no weaker than Qing Jun's Five Directions Pagoda. But Bing Han didn't do so, letting it remain there until it nurtured its own spirit. The fiery cocoon, containing the jade blade, sank into the Fire Spring.</p><p>"Thank you both for your help," Bing Han landed beside them, her beautiful eyes glancing about. "Daoist Qin, I thought I had already overestimated you, but you keep surprising us."</p><p>"This puppet is still a bit rough. The situation was urgent just now, so I had no choice but to use it. I apologize if I've caused you any inconvenience. Qin has quite a few enemies; I hope you two will keep this a secret," Qin Sang smiled slightly, putting away the spirit body puppet and gazing at the jade blade. This jade blade was very likely the first spiritual treasure he had personally refined. He wondered if he would ever have the chance to see it unleash its power.</p><p>The other two wisely asked no further questions.</p><p>Bing Han said, "You both have worked hard. I have prepared pills for you. Quickly go and suppress the fire poison in your bodies, lest you suffer lingering effects."</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "May I now peruse the scriptures of your sect?"</p><p>"Of course!" Bing Han nodded, activating the spirit array to seal the Fire Spring.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flowed like water. In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had spent ten years at the Xu Ling Sect.  Many things happened during those ten years.  Two years ago, Jing Yu successfully broke through to the mid-Transformation stage, followed immediately by a Heavenly Tribulation, which was extremely perilous. In the end, Jing Yu safely passed the tribulation.  Overjoyed, Qin Sang insisted on holding a grand ceremony for Jing Yu in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, inviting many demon cultivators. He also appeared at the ceremony. Seeing Jing Yu's attitude towards Qin Sang, the various demon kings understood the significance of this event. The Snake King took the initiative to toast Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang himself eagerly studied various scriptures, learning the Xu Ling Sect's unique techniques.  During this time, Li Yu Fu continuously sent him various spiritual materials to practice with, and his progress in the way of refining weapons advanced by leaps and bounds. The refined magic weapons were either given to Li Yu Fu, used to reward sect members, or sold.  Li Yu Fu and others frequently interacted with the Xu Ling Sect disciples, becoming quite familiar with each other.</p>
