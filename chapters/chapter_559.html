<h1>Chapter 552: An Unexpected Turn of Events</h1><p>After they each retrieved their most trusted magical artifacts, the small courtyard became a dazzling display of vibrant colors. Besides common artifacts like swords, mirrors, pagodas, banners, and flags, there were quite a few that even Qin Sang couldn't recognize, suggesting unique functionalities.  Clearly, anyone who qualified to enter the courtyard was no ordinary cultivator.</p><p>Mu Yifeng still wielded his Nine Fire Divine Edge.  He had meticulously refined this artifact for years, pouring countless efforts into it. Now, the flames on the nine fire dragons shimmered with a purplish hue, exceeding the typical evaluation of a top-grade artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that Mu Yifeng's dedication to this single artifact stemmed from his intention to further enhance the Nine Fire Divine Edge after forming his Gold Core, possibly making it his life-bound magical treasure.</p><p>Zhan Yi, on the other hand, wielded a fist-sized brass bell, something Qin Sang hadn't seen before.</p><p>Soon, everyone was ready.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Chen Yan gently waved her hand, and spiritual energy condensed at her fingertips, forming a paper crane. The crane let out a clear chirp, spread its wings, and flew into the courtyard.</p><p>Hovering above everyone, the paper crane suddenly began to flap its wings rapidly, sending gentle gusts of wind downwards.</p><p>*Whooooosh...*</p><p>A gale erupted within the courtyard, yet it was precisely controlled, contained within the boundaries of the group. This level of precise control alone was enough to make others despair.</p><p>Qin Sang silently observed the courtyard, attempting to discern Chen Yan's cultivation level through the paper crane and the wind, but to no avail.</p><p>The wind intensified, becoming tangible.</p><p>Like a dark cloud, it slowly descended!</p><p>A curtain of wind formed around each person.  The curtain was dense and heavy, exerting immense pressure on those within.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others activated their artifacts, struggling to withstand the wind's pressure.</p><p>As the wind curtains grew thicker, the figures within became almost invisible.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Finally, someone couldn't hold on and collapsed. Just as they were about to hit the ground, the pressure suddenly vanished, sparing them from embarrassment. The cultivator bowed apologetically and retreated to the side.</p><p>The pressure on the others continued to increase.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn't gauge Chen Yan's cultivation through the paper crane, Qin Sang stopped bothering and focused on his acquaintances, Mu Yifeng and Zhan Yi.</p><p>Where Mu Yifeng stood, only the shadows of the nine fire dragons could be seen, forming a circle to resist the wind curtain.</p><p>Zhan Yi's brass bell floated above his head, emitting a rich yellow glow like a bright lamp. From the sound, it was evident that the bell was shaking increasingly faster.</p><p>*Thud! Thud! Thud!...*</p><p>One by one, more cultivators fell, including some at the Pseudo Gold Core realm.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. It seemed this test wasn't simply about cultivation level. The specific nature of the wind curtain remained unclear.</p><p>As time passed, fewer and fewer remained.</p><p>Suddenly, Zhan Yi roared, the bell's ringing intensified, and the yellow light above his head flared, but to no avail. His figure swayed violently.</p><p>As the curtain dissipated, Zhan Yi steadied himself.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the undisguised disappointment on Zhan Yi's face.  He discreetly observed Che Yutao and saw him shake his head slightly, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes.  Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder what it all meant.</p><p>Finally, only three remained, including Mu Yifeng.</p><p>But these three were clearly at their limit. Mu Yifeng's nine fire dragons had become thin and frail, like flickering candles in the wind, threatening to extinguish at any moment.</p><p>A barely audible sigh escaped from beneath the hooded figure.</p><p>Che Yutao said somewhat awkwardly, "My disciples are incompetent.  I apologize for this display, Miss Chen Yan. The summons from the Sect Master and yourself was too sudden. Other disciples are either on missions or in seclusion, attempting to form their Gold Cores. Even if they returned now, they wouldn't have enough time to refine their artifacts and suppress the vengeful spirits within the beast seals. We can't trust disciples from other sects. However, once the Five Elements Beast Seal is activated, the five wielders become one. With Mu Bai and the other two, even if the remaining two are slightly weaker, it shouldn't affect the overall situation."</p><p>Chen Yan hummed in response.  "It'll have to do."</p><p>Just then, a dragon's roar echoed from the courtyard. The nine fire dragons around Mu Yifeng suddenly dispersed, and a red point of light burst forth from beneath the curtain, piercing through like a sharp cone.</p><p>Accompanied by a rumbling sound, Mu Yifeng, wielding the Nine Fire Divine Edge, broke through the wind!</p><p>Mu Yifeng stumbled but managed to regain his footing.</p><p>The situation had taken an unexpected turn.</p><p>Che Yutao's eyes lit up. He praised, "Excellent! You may join us."</p><p>"Thank you, Uncle Che!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng bowed, withdrew his Nine Fire Divine Edge to nurture it within his body, and strode over to Qin Sang, raising an eyebrow smugly.</p><p>The remaining two weren't so fortunate. Despite numerous attempts, they couldn't break through the curtain.  Finally, one collapsed, and the pressure on both vanished.</p><p>"The rest of you may leave."</p><p>Che Yutao called the last remaining cultivator forward, dismissed the others, and then addressed Chen Yan, "The team is now assembled. I will report to Master."</p><p>Chen Yan nodded, then suddenly stood up.  Her figure flickered, and she vanished into thin air.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, she hadn't seemed to glance at Qin Sang even once.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other four stood side-by-side, filled with curiosity.</p><p>Only then did they learn from Che Yutao that their Patriarch had already arrived at Hanging Skull Pass, and this test had been initiated by the Patriarch himself.</p><p>For some reason, a sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang.</p><p>Che Yutao waved his hand, sending out a beam of cyan light. Moments later, everyone felt a sudden tightness in their chests and heard a gentle voice, "Are these the ones?"</p><p>*That's Duke Dongyang!*</p><p>Qin Sang's mind reeled.</p><p>Che Yutao bowed respectfully towards the empty space and said, "Reporting to Master, these are the five strongest disciples currently within the pass."</p><p>With a single word, "Good," a five-colored rainbow flew into the hall.  Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the light emanating from five small seals.</p><p>These five small seals were identical in size and shape, the only difference being their knobs.</p><p>Each seal knob was carved with a sacred beast, corresponding to the legendary Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, White Tiger, and a divine beast resembling a Qilin, known as Gouchen.</p><p>"Teach them to carefully comprehend the essence of the beast seals and assist me!"</p><p>"Your disciple obeys!"</p><p>Che Yutao received the small seals, turned to Qin Sang and the others, and with a gentle flick of his wrist, sent each seal flying towards them.</p><p>The seal before Qin Sang was the one with the Black Tortoise carved on its knob.</p><p>The Black Tortoise on the seal was lifelike, with thick limbs and its head raised towards the heavens, as if roaring defiantly, exuding an aura of untamed ferocity.</p><p>Che Yutao said calmly, "From now on, each of you will control one of these beast seals and refine it with all your might. You must subdue the vengeful spirit within the seal within six months. Then, you will accompany the Patriarch and Miss Chen Yan into the Ziwei Palace."</p><p>*What!*</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was in turmoil.</p><p>--</p><p>Long-awaited, here are two Penguin groups.
