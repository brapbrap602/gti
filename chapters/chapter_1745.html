<h1>Chapter 1736: Old Foes</h1><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>The island was teeming with distinguished guests; Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming were stretched thin.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Grandmaster Yang discussed cultivation techniques, a servant announced the arrival of Bao Xi.</p><p>Grandmaster Yang wisely withdrew.</p><p>Bao Xi performed a courtesy, saying, "We have news about the people Daoist Friend Qin is looking for. However..."</p><p>She paused, hesitant.</p><p>From her expression, Qin Sang understood, and said gravely, "The way of Heaven is constant, each person has their own fate. Please, speak freely."</p><p>Bao Xi nodded. "Guardian Chen personally visited Lingchun Island. They didn't find the sect to which the Wang sisters belonged.  Inquiries revealed that during the demonic upheaval, a powerful demon king broke through the defenses. Lingchun Island was right in the path of the demonic invasion; the cultivators there were forced to flee. The Wang sisters' sect was also destroyed, but thankfully, they escaped. However, they both suffered varying degrees of injury, and neither was able to break through to the Nascent Soul stage before passing away."</p><p>Before hearing this, Qin Sang had a premonition that the Wang sisters likely wouldn't survive.</p><p>Confirming their deaths, she couldn't help but feel the cruelty of time.</p><p>"Where is their sect now?"</p><p>"After fleeing Lingchun Island, they led the surviving members to a secluded island in the Western Sea and re-established their sect. But their foundation was destroyed, and their manpower dwindled, making their early years extremely difficult. The Wang sisters poured their hearts and souls into their sect, and after years of recovery, they have finally regained some vitality…"</p><p>Bao Xi briefly described the current state of the Wang sisters' sect.</p><p>The demonic upheaval had lasting consequences, and the situation of cultivators in the Canglang Sea was far worse than before.</p><p>The casualties of war were secondary.</p><p>The demons of the Demon Sea could now threaten the heartland of the Canglang Sea, a drastic change from their previous defensive position.  They had far fewer restraints.</p><p>While the teleportation array to the Demon Sea remained under cultivator control, the Demon Sea was far more dangerous than before. Only a select few powerful individuals dared to hunt demons there.</p><p>Cultivation resources had sharply decreased.</p><p>The strong remained strong, and the weak remained weak.</p><p>"The current sect leader is a disciple of Daoist Friend Wang Xiang. Guardian Chen has invited her to Tianxing Island. Should she be summoned to meet Daoist Friend?" Bao Xi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head slightly. "No need. I would be grateful if your palace would offer them protection."</p><p>Bao Xi didn't ask further questions, readily agreeing.  For the Four Saints Palace, protecting a small sect was a simple matter. She continued, "The palace sent people to the Liefeng Islands, but we found no female cultivator matching Bai Ying'er's description, nor did anyone on the battlefield see the two-headed demonic beast Daoist Friend described. However, during our investigation, we learned that a hundred years ago, a cultivator hunting demons in the Demon Sea encountered a three-headed demonic beast, presumably a transformed demon king.  According to the cultivator, the three-headed beast was incredibly bloodthirsty.  It merely glanced at him before leaving. The cultivator was terrified and saw the beast’s appearance, but he couldn’t clearly identify it or confirm whether the beast was accompanied by a human cultivator."</p><p>"A three-headed demonic beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the two-headed beast had two heads, but there was a noticeable bulge suggesting a third head, meaning a breakthrough to the transformed stage might result in an additional head.</p><p>"What kind of bloodline is this thing?  It gets another head with each advancement?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Unfortunately, the witness was too frightened to observe the three-headed beast closely.</p><p>If it was indeed the two-headed beast, given its arrogant nature, it would never willingly serve as someone's spirit beast, let alone be accompanied by a woman—unless she was a pet?</p><p>It seemed the beast was living quite a carefree life.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang said that if they found it, it would be good, but if not, she wouldn’t press the matter.  Knowing about the whereabouts of her old acquaintances was enough; there was no need to cause any further disturbance.</p><p>Bao Xi acknowledged her understanding and then mentioned another powerful demon, "We can essentially confirm that the Nine-Phoenix King Daoist Friend seeks is indeed the current Nine-Phoenix King of the Demon Sea's phoenix clan.  She has always been a major enemy to our human race. While only at the peak of the mid-Transformation stage, this demon holds a high position within the demonic army and possesses remarkable abilities.  Even Elder Zhuo couldn't guarantee capturing her; numerous Nascent Soul cultivators have fallen to her."</p><p>Listening to Bao Xi recount the Nine-Phoenix King's countless crimes, Qin Sang wasn't surprised. The Nine-Phoenix King was probably the first demon king from the Demon Sea to infiltrate the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Her courage and abilities were top-notch.</p><p>The intelligence the Nine-Phoenix King gathered in the Canglang Sea significantly aided the demonic invasion.</p><p>"Where is she now?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's expression and tone remained unchanged, Bao Xi keenly sensed a difference in her attitude compared to when the three-headed demonic beast was mentioned.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang had long been a thorn in the side of the Si Sheng Gong. Bao Xi chuckled darkly, "A sizable Phoenix army is stationed on a demon island two thousand li north of Da Huang Island.  A new commander took over ten years ago, and he's been very secretive.  Intelligence suggests this commander might be Jiu Feng Wang himself."</p><p>The last major conflict ended with the demon race failing to take Da Huang Island, but they left several armies stationed within ten thousand li, keeping a close watch on the human race.</p><p>A long period of uneasy peace followed.</p><p>The Si Sheng Gong knew the demons were building strength, preparing for another war.  But they lacked effective countermeasures, as both the human and witch clans needed to recuperate.</p><p>Now, the storm clouds were gathering. Bao Zhengnan was worried, but Qin Sang's arrival was timely.</p><p>"Whether it's him or not, we'll soon find out."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, accepting the sea chart from Bao Xi and committing the demon island to memory.</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The grand assembly convened.</p><p>Various sects and factions, anticipating a major war, were on high alert.  Qin Sang's appearance caused a collective gasp.</p><p>News that Qin Sang would mediate the conflict between the two realms was met with mixed reactions. Some grumbled, finding it inappropriate that a human would not prioritize human interests.  However, they dared not voice their complaints openly.</p><p>Many others felt relieved.</p><p>Years of warfare had left them exhausted and traumatized.</p><p>What was the point of cultivation?  Many had questioned their path during those dark days.  If peace led to immortality, that was surely the dream of most cultivators.</p><p>Alas, human nature is fickle. The conflict between the three races had only deepened over time.</p><p>The root of the hatred lay in the relentless demon hunting by the human and witch clans. Yet, they justified their actions with lofty ideals and could hardly abandon the use of powerful demon-slaying pills.</p><p>Strife is almost inseparable from cultivation.</p><p>Initially, the demons harbored deep resentment. Now, they have added countless atrocities in the Cang Lang Sea to the score.</p><p>A tangled web of grievances, impossible to unravel.</p><p>The arrival of Qin Sang, a transcendent figure willing to mediate, was met with widespread approval.</p><p>His announcement of the existence of a Heavenly Ascension Platform caused an uproar. Even the usually stoic Yuan Ying cultivators were agitated, demanding confirmation.</p><p>Even those with lingering grievances put aside their resentments.</p><p>The endless conflict stemmed from a lack of hope, forcing them to focus on immediate gains and their legacies, leading to petty squabbles.</p><p>Every person present was a powerful leader, yet how many dared to dream of becoming a Hua Shen cultivator?</p><p>The possibility of ascension at the late Yuan Ying stage offered a beacon of hope, far more attainable than Hua Shen.</p><p>Under Qin Sang and the Si Sheng Gong’s leadership, the human clans forged an alliance, prioritizing the search for the Ascension Platform. But a lasting peace hinged on more than just human cooperation.</p><p>Qin Sang declared that he would soon visit the major clans of the Demon Sea.</p><p>Following the alliance's formation, Qin Sang retreated into seclusion.</p><p>Many attempted to visit, but were turned away by the Si Sheng Gong.</p><p>Over the following period, Yang Shouzuo fully supported Qin Sang in his study of the Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique, helping to refine the cultivation method. Even areas that couldn’t be altered benefited from Qin Sang's suggestions, using alternative techniques or pills to mitigate risks.</p><p>Refining cultivation techniques was incredibly demanding, even more taxing than cultivation itself!</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang thoroughly revised the Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique, smoothing many bottlenecks for future practitioners of the Yin-Yang lineage, benefiting himself immensely in the process.</p><p>...</p><p>One day.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in his cave, repeatedly examining a white chess piece.</p><p>Refining the technique was a gradual process of uncovering the secrets of the chess piece, but even with Qin Sang's cultivation, progress was slow.</p><p>Considering his upcoming tasks—body refinement, repairing the Taiyi Star Chart, comprehending sword formations—they all seemed more pressing than the chess piece.</p><p>Oh, and the spirit fire!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He curled his fingers, put away the chess piece, pondered for a moment, then rose and left the cave, heading straight for the teleportation array.  Upon arriving at Da Huang Island, Bao Zhengnan and his men were waiting.</p><p>"Is Daoist Qin departing for the demon clan today?"</p><p>In front of others, Bao Zhengnan maintained his formal demeanor.</p><p>Ascending to the highest point of Da Huang Island, Qin Sang surveyed the scene; the island teemed with soldiers, their ranks orderly.</p><p>If the humans wanted peace, the demons might not agree. Bao Zhengnan was rallying the troops to see Qin Sang off.</p><p>Such a large-scale mobilization couldn't be hidden. News of the human activity on Da Huang Island spread to the demon clans like wildfire.</p><p>Luo Ying Island.</p><p>Located two thousand li north of Da Huang Island, this island has been under Phoenix clan control for millennia. It’s famous for the Luo Ying spirit trees that bear crimson fruits, a delicacy favored by the Phoenix clan.</p><p>After establishing a teleportation array on Da Huang Island, the human cultivators quickly conquered Luo Ying Island due to its proximity.  The island's Phoenix descendants were expelled.</p><p>Luo Ying fruits are useless, even harmful, to humans.</p><p>However, the Luo Ying trees were valuable spiritwood, and were soon felled by the human cultivators. Later, cultivators, noticing the island's abundant spiritual energy, established caves there, completely seizing the island.</p><p>For millennia, the demon race launched countless counterattacks, occasionally reclaiming Luo Ying Island, but these efforts always stalled due to the inability to conquer Da Huang Island.</p><p>Centuries ago, after suffering a decisive defeat, the humans became more cautious, allowing Luo Ying Island to return to Phoenix control, though the Luo Ying trees were gone.</p><p>The Phoenix dispatched a large army to garrison the island and monitor the humans. Any disturbance on Da Huang Island is immediately detected here.</p><p>The Phoenix is the king of spirit birds.</p><p>Many demon bird tribes are affiliated with the Phoenix.</p><p>Now, Luo Ying Island is densely covered with towering trees.  Among the thick foliage, countless nests and caves are visible, all built in the treetops.</p><p>Demon birds constantly patrol the skies.</p><p>The leaders among the demon birds are easily identifiable; they often have vibrant plumage or possess features reminiscent of the legendary Phoenix, typically being direct Phoenix descendants.</p><p>However, even those of royal blood like Jiu Feng Wang, a descendant of the Celestial Phoenix, appear somewhat unconventional due to their diluted Phoenix bloodline.  The demon race, however, possesses the unique ability to refine their bloodline through cultivation, gradually undergoing transformation.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>Numerous demon birds take flight from Luo Ying Island, led by their respective leaders, flying in various directions.</p><p>Inside an ornate tree house on the island…</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang, transformed into a human form, possesses a delicate beauty unchanged from years past, yet her eyes are sharper, reflecting her hardened experience in battle.</p><p>She holds a golden short horn, shaped like a dragon's horn, covered in blood vessels.</p><p>The horn glows faintly, as the blood vessels one by one detach themselves, piercing Jiu Feng Wang's flawless skin.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang feels no pain, closing her eyes slightly, and immediately senses a voice from the horn.</p><p>“Why are the humans gathering their army now? Who leaked the secret?”</p><p>“Who needs to leak it?” another voice responds, “Humans are cowardly; any slight movement will trigger a reaction.  Even the Jiao Wang didn't expect to completely conceal our actions from them.  Regardless, we've prepared for so long, there's no turning back!”</p><p>“Don't you find it strange that the human reaction is so intense even before our main force has mobilized?” the first voice questioned.</p><p>“Does Si Feng Wang believe the humans dare to launch a counterattack?” a third voice interjected.</p><p>“I suspect the humans have ulterior motives!”</p><p>“I share that suspicion,” Jiu Feng Wang interjected, “I've ordered my subordinates to spread out and monitor the humans' movements.  You must also be wary of other directions; don't be misled by appearances.”</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang holds a high position among these demon kings.  Her words immediately garner agreement, with another demon king reminding, “Jiu Feng Wang, you must also be careful. If the humans know you're here, they will certainly send experts to ambush you.”</p><p>…</p><p>After a brief exchange with the other demon kings stationed near Da Huang Island, Jiu Feng Wang puts away the horn and rubs her temples. She isn't concerned for her own safety; the island is well-defended, and with her innate abilities, she can escape even if powerful human cultivators arrive.</p><p>Why are the humans assembling their army at this time?</p><p>Lost in thought, Jiu Feng Wang opens the wooden door, intending to dispatch more troops, when suddenly the giant tree beneath her violently shakes, followed by a thunderclap in the clear sky!</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang is startled, looking up in alarm to see a lightning-like sword beam striking the protective array.</p><p>The Phoenix and human races have different inheritances.  The Phoenix excel at harnessing their tribal energy to form powerful arrays comparable to human spirit arrays, but this sword beam causes the entire Luo Ying Island to tremble.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>Demon birds rain down from the treetops, feathers flying as they're stunned by the concussive force; weaker ones are instantly killed!</p><p>A crimson protective dome appears in mid-air, now covered in cracks.</p><p>Yet, she still hasn't seen her attacker!</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang turns to rush back into the hut, but her vision blurs, and a figure suddenly appears before her.</p><p>Her hand transforms into a blade, her palm glowing with seven colors, instinctively ready to attack, while simultaneously drawing blood from her palm. Before she can activate her abilities, an overwhelming pressure descends, paralyzing her, her face filled with terror.</p><p>Before she can react, the surroundings transform.</p><p>The ancient trees vanish, replaced by a starry expanse. Jiu Feng Wang senses that her connection to the outside world is completely severed, and all her clan's defensive measures on the island are rendered useless!</p><p>“Where are you going, friend?”</p><p>Qin Sang lands openly before Jiu Feng Wang.</p><p>Initially, Jiu Feng Wang doesn't recognize Qin Sang, only finding him vaguely familiar.  However, the experience of the Seven Killing Palace leaves a lasting impression on her; she finally remembers Qin Sang, and exclaims, "It's you?"</p><p>(End)</p>
