<h1>Volume 1 Summary</h1><p>I had a lot to say, but now I find it all a bit sentimental.  These words are written and placed here for the readers to judge. I will only briefly mention three points.</p><p>First, many say this book puts the protagonist through the wringer. I don't entirely agree. The journey is certainly winding, but if you examine each plot point, you'll find the protagonist overcomes every obstacle and achieves their goals.  Having everything go your way only happens in fiction. This perception might stem from my narrative style. I've realized that an author's descriptive tendencies can influence the reader's emotions, but I'm still learning and haven't quite figured it out yet. I'll continue to learn and improve.</p><p>Second, regarding the protagonist's Foundation Establishment. What I'm most proud of is that the plot progression has largely adhered to the outline, maintaining a coherent beginning, development, climax, and resolution.  Because of this, Volume 1 inadvertently reached six hundred chapters. When I initially designed the outline, I lacked experience and had no concept of how word count correlated with plot points. My only thought was to enrich the story, incorporate all the plot threads I wanted, and weave connections between them, giving each segment a clear antecedent. In retrospect, some parts could have been streamlined.</p><p>Third is the only plot point that deviated from the outline, and the primary reason I'm writing this summary: Qin Sang being deemed without spiritual roots in the Sui Dynasty and subsequently being refused entry into the Han family.  The original outline had the overweight member of the Han family bribed by the Eastern Yang Princess with a valuable spiritual material to dash Qin Sang's hopes and keep them in Sui. As I approached revealing the truth, I hesitated. There's a saying in cultivation novels: "To sever someone's path of cultivation is akin to killing their parents."  Whether the princess acted out of self-interest or affection, such an act seemed unforgivable.  Writing it that way had one advantage: it would reinforce the princess's established character as a ruthless and ambitious climber who would stop at nothing to achieve her goals. But besides portraying a vivid character, what benefit would it have for the overall plot or the protagonist?  It seemed to serve no purpose other than to cause anguish for both the protagonist and the reader. This small segment kept me up at night for days.  I finally decided to change it, and I also cut several subsequent minor plot points involving interactions with Han.  This part feels somewhat unfinished, and some readers have likely noticed.  Even now, I'm unsure whether this was the right decision. What's done is done. If there's an opportunity for revision in the future, I'll revisit it.</p><p>Summary complete, the journey continues!</p>
