<h1>Chapter 1415: The 'd' Seal</h1><p>Chapter 1415: The 'd' Seal</p><p>The heat was unbearable.</p><p>It felt like being thrown into a furnace.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's most immediate impression upon entering the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Even with his mid-Yuan Ying cultivation, he couldn't shield himself from the external influence.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how much fiery energy had accumulated within the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>The fiery energy was suppressed here; what was inside the spirit array was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that the Jing Hai Sect might explode at any moment, turning the sect and its intruders to ashes.</p><p>He carefully observed for a long time, confirming that no one else was inside the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>“Thanks to the Sky-Eye Butterfly’s abilities. Oh, and the Fire Jade Centipede guiding the way, I was one step ahead of the Hun Mo Elder, breaking through the array first…”</p><p>Qin Sang roughly understood the reason but didn't relax because of it.  “The Hun Mo Elder knows the Jing Hai Sect very well, his cultivation surpasses mine, and he has help. They definitely won't be far behind me. The Golden Summit, the Pagoda… these places are probably important locations of the Jing Hai Sect, likely containing Buddhist treasures, but they are also sealed by powerful restrictions.  I can probably only crack one place before the Hun Mo Elder arrives.”</p><p>With these thoughts racing through his mind, Qin Sang rapidly descended, carefully observing his surroundings.</p><p>His vision was affected by the purple flames, but he could roughly make out the outline of the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>Through the purple flames, he faintly saw a golden dome covering the Jing Hai Sect; it was the protective sect array manifested.</p><p>Just as he had anticipated.</p><p>The Jing Hai Sect's area wasn't large, and neither was the spirit array.</p><p>He had spent a full five days, essentially moving back and forth in a small area; the boundless space of the spirit array was an illusion.</p><p>This wasn't good.</p><p>The smaller the area, the higher the chance of Qin Sang being discovered, and the less room he had to maneuver.</p><p>Forcibly breaking unfamiliar Buddhist restrictions would inevitably create anomalies.  Any major action by Qin Sang wouldn't escape the Hun Mo Elder's senses.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.</p><p>He was isolated and helpless, feeling restricted.</p><p>With no sign of Sect Master Mu and the others, Qin Sang suspected that their situation was dire. A grand cultivator’s deliberate ambush; his own unscathed survival was already fortunate.</p><p>The enemy was strong, and he was weak.</p><p>And the enemy had help.</p><p>“Five days, it should attract a few more Yuan Ying cultivators. Hopefully, they haven’t joined forces. The more chaotic the situation, the better. Ideally, there'd be a deadly enemy of the Hun Mo Elder, triggering a treasure battle, allowing me to fish in troubled waters…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, sighing inwardly.</p><p>He was a newcomer, unfamiliar with the complex relationships between the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Boundless Sea. Otherwise, he could have used their grudges to create opportunities.</p><p>Considering his strategy, Qin Sang passed through the purple flames and landed on a mountain peak.</p><p>The rocks were scorching hot.</p><p>This place, once lush and vibrant, was now scorched earth, filled with deathly silence.</p><p>“Forget about thinking too much, at least get one treasure first, then improvise later.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood on solid ground, his eyes scanning.</p><p>Those insignificant Buddhist sects aside, he had finally found a powerful Buddhist sect's ruins, but the Jade Buddha remained silent, offering no guidance, leaving him somewhat disappointed.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang locked onto two of the most striking locations.</p><p>The first was the center where two mountain ranges intersected.</p><p>Fiery energy erupted there, and the Golden Summit was built on the peak of a mountain adjacent to this spot, the highest peak of the entire Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>The second was a thirteen-story pagoda.</p><p>The pagoda was further away, built on a slope; its Buddhist light was somewhat dimmer than the Golden Summit's brilliance, but it was still extraordinary.</p><p>The Golden Summit and the Pagoda were clearly important locations of the Jing Hai Sect, considered equally important in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't move because the Fire Jade Centipede pointed towards another direction!</p><p>Not the Pagoda, nor the Golden Summit, but a valley behind him, almost at the end of the mountain range!</p><p>Qin Sang looked as far as he could see, only seeing purple flames.</p><p>He felt a stir in his heart, “The Myriad Spirits Fruit is there, it's probably the Myriad Spirits Fruit tree! The Jing Hai Sect's medicine garden has been preserved, likely containing more than just the Myriad Spirits Fruit tree. Obtaining a few spirit herbs wouldn't be a wasted trip. The Golden Summit and the Pagoda are tempting, but their restrictions are also strong; I might not be able to break them before the Hun Mo Elder arrives, and even if I do, I might not get treasures suitable for me. Spirit herbs are different, and the Myriad Spirits Fruit is crucial for the insect's advancement…”</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately decided to go to the medicine garden first!</p><p>Just as he was about to act, he noticed something, abruptly turning his head, staring intently at the place where the fiery energy erupted, then raising his head to look at the sky, his eyes flickering.</p><p>He only then noticed…</p><p>A volcanic vent, spewing fiery breath, showed a faint golden glow, forming a character that resembled a seal.</p><p>This seal, along with the golden summit's and pagoda's restrictions, and even the protective sect formation, seemed to be interconnected.</p><p>“Could the entire Jinghai Sect be a massive seal? What is sealed within the fiery breath? And what would happen if the seal were broken?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, his eyes narrowing.  He noticed more details – the golden summit was fine, but the pagoda looked precarious.</p><p>His thoughts racing, Qin Sang continued his movement without pause. He swiftly traversed the peaks, constantly monitoring the aerial formations.  The Fire Jade Centipede was growing more agitated, indicating they were nearing the Wanling Fruit.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the valley, looking down to see it shrouded in a fog, now purple from the fiery assault and damaged, yet the barrier remained.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. He deployed his Yuan Ying puppet to guard, and then vanished into the mist.</p><p>A whooshing sound filled the air as the mist churned.  The barrier here was indeed affected, but less substantial than the sect's main defenses.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly found a weakness and entered, finding a rectangular patch of land before him.</p><p>“A medicinal garden!”</p><p>The land was scorched earth, the herbs reduced to ash.  Following the Fire Jade Centipede's guidance, Qin Sang continued deeper.</p><p>Patch after patch of scorched earth, a heartbreaking sight. Finally, Qin Sang stopped. The Fire Jade Centipede throbbed, eager to advance.</p><p>The Wanling Fruit was ahead, yet Qin Sang saw no fruit tree, only thick purple mist.</p><p>“A deception?” he thought.  The Jinghai Sect clearly placed more importance on the Wanling Fruit tree than on other medicinal fields.</p><p>“Could the Jinghai Sect possess the method to refine Zhenling Incense?”</p><p>Mulling this over, Qin Sang summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, using a Wu tribe secret technique with its abilities to carefully observe for a long time, finally noticing something.</p><p>“Go!” Qin Sang commanded, rising on his sword, striking the seemingly empty purple mist.</p><p>A booming sound echoed as the mist vibrated, the sword light disappearing into nothingness.  Simultaneously, a golden light burst from the mist, but vanished instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang, instead of being alarmed, felt a surge of joy. Recalling the phenomenon, he struck again moments later with his sword.</p>
