<h1>Chapter 2161: The Youying Clan</h1><p>Hearing this, Si Huang smiled. “To be honest with Fellow Daoist Qin Sang, the treasures stored within the Ancient Hall are indeed priceless for our Otherfolk, but outsiders can derive little benefit from them. This is because one must be within the Ancestral Hall, borrowing its power, to refine them.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Outsiders couldn't enter the Otherfolk's Ancestral Hall. Even if they forced their way in, they wouldn't gain its recognition. He couldn't refine the treasures, and even if he could trade them, offending the Si You Royal Clan would outweigh any gains.</p><p>Si Huang’s offer was appealing. Qin Sang was genuinely interested in the origins of the Myriad Manifestations Pearl, especially after discovering its hidden mysteries. His appraisal of the pearl had risen considerably.</p><p>If the Myriad Manifestations Pearl was related to some inheritance, that inheritance must be of significant origin. It would be worth investigating, given the opportunity.</p><p>Helping Si Huang seize the treasure was risky, but Qin Sang believed his escape techniques and strength were sufficient. As long as he remained vigilant, his life shouldn't be in danger.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang said, "This humble Daoist cannot guarantee that I can help Fellow Daoist obtain the treasure, but I will do my best."</p><p>"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Qin Sang!"</p><p>Si Huang was overjoyed. The three immediately began discussing their strategy.</p><p>While Si Huang had repeatedly assured Qin Sang that he wouldn't be put in mortal danger, once the fighting began, the situation might not unfold according to their plans. Qin Sang's approach to the Ancient Hall would inevitably attract the attention of all their opponents.  After the Ancient Hall opened, there was no telling what their opponents might do. They could only adapt to the circumstances, and Qin Sang couldn't simply turn tail and run.</p><p>The three quickly agreed on a course of action, maneuvering around the gray figures while keeping an eye on the radiant glow and their opponents' movements.</p><p>The four Feathered Race cultivators were increasingly harassed by the gray figures, under mounting pressure, and forced to retreat steadily.</p><p>As one of the slightly weaker Saint-Winged cultivators separated from their companions, Si Huang and Shao Shi exchanged a glance and discreetly moved closer to the isolated individual.</p><p>The other three Feathered Race experts saw their companion being targeted and wanted to help, but they were also worried about missing the treasures within the secret realm. They were caught in a dilemma.</p><p>The isolated cultivator, realizing they were a liability, decisively abandoned resistance, allowing the radiant glow to push them back. The other three retreated to a position roughly equal to Si Huang and Shao Shi, engaging in a standoff across the distance, preventing them from acting rashly.</p><p>Unable to pursue the cultivator personally, Si Huang secretly transmitted a message to Da Huangzi.</p><p>Da Huangzi and the other two were already struggling to resist both the radiant glow and the gray figures, with little room to maneuver. They then gave chase to the retreating cultivator.</p><p>With Da Huangzi and the others gradually moving further away, only six remained. Qin Sang intentionally concealed his strength, lagging behind and appearing to struggle, giving the impression that their side was weaker.</p><p>“That Saint-Winged cultivator is the Feathered Race's Marquis Dingyuan. The other two are likely not from the Feathered Race,” Si Huang said.</p><p>Shao Shi also sent a mental transmission, warning, "They are deliberately concealing their identities, carefully avoiding the use of bloodline divine abilities during their clashes with the gray figures.  We might have to engage them directly to determine their tribal origins. Fellow Daoist Qin Sang, be careful.”</p><p>The inheritances of the various Otherfolk tribes differed greatly. Without knowing their opponents' identities, they could only adapt as the situation unfolded.</p><p>Just then, Si Huang suddenly flew into a rage, roaring, “Preposterous!”</p><p>Marquis Dingyuan responded with a cold sneer, his face filled with mockery. It was clear that they had been negotiating through mental transmissions and the talks had broken down.</p><p>Although neither side showed weakness, they dared not initiate a battle lightly.</p><p>As time passed, the situation remained stagnant.  Just as both sides reached an impasse, the radiant glow erupted once more, this time with even greater intensity than before.</p><p>At the very moment the radiant glow reached its dazzling peak, the gray figures in front of Qin Sang suddenly burst into clouds of gray mist, then dissipated without a trace.</p><p>"Now!" Si Huang shouted softly.</p><p>They had anticipated that the gray figures might dissipate on their own and had been waiting for this moment. Without hesitation, they immediately attacked.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strongest wave of impact from the erupting radiant glow arrived. Marquis Dingyuan and the other two hadn't expected the gray figures to vanish so abruptly.  Seeing the radiant glow erupt, they cautiously braced for the next change, momentarily hesitant to act.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions noticed their opponents' hesitation.  This was a golden opportunity!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi lunged towards their opponents. A sphere of primal yellow light appeared between the two figures.  Within the sphere of light, a painted scroll floated, rapidly unfurling.</p><p>This time, Si Huang and Shao Shi jointly activated the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram. The two peak experts were in perfect sync, having prepared beforehand. Eight companion beasts leaped into the diagram, and the treasure immediately unleashed its immense power.</p><p>Ignoring the impact of the radiant glow, Si Huang and Shao Shi attacked with their full strength. The primal yellow light seemed to merge with the radiant glow, transforming into landmasses in the void, complete with mountains, rivers, and vegetation, making it difficult to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>This treasure had been damaged during the previous attack on Qin Sang, yet the power it displayed now surpassed its former glory, not solely due to its two powerful wielders.</p><p>As Si Huang attacked, a golden crown appeared above his head, transforming into a streak of light that merged into the diagram, causing its power to surge!</p><p>In an instant, Marquis Dingyuan and the others found themselves on a landmass, surrounded by majestic mountains and rivers, and flourishing vegetation.</p><p>Above them, a sea of clouds churned, filled with primal yellow clouds, mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p>Then, immense pressure descended upon them from all directions, as if every mountain, every river, every tree, and every blade of grass were their enemies.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>At the same moment Si Huang attacked, lightning crackled behind Qin Sang, and his phoenix wings beat powerfully.  Casting aside his previous sluggishness, he didn't join the battle but instead charged towards the core of the secret realm, facing the radiant glow head-on.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the radiant glow at the core of the secret realm was beginning to recede. However, this didn't mean it was safe.</p><p>They had only deduced from the traces within the Great Calamity Nest that the radiant glow might dissipate along with the gray figures, but no one knew for certain if it would mutate. This action still carried significant risk.</p><p>With their agreement made, Qin Sang couldn't back down now. A bolt of azure lightning streaked against the current of the radiant glow.  Even the powerful impact force of the radiant glow couldn't stop his advance.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram.</p><p>Marquis Dingyuan and the other two wouldn't simply wait for their demise.</p><p>Si Huang’s timing had caught them off guard, but they were seasoned veterans.  They immediately realized that Si Huang likely knew the patterns of the radiant glow.</p><p>Even with their vision obscured by the primal yellow clouds, they could guess that Si Huang was aiming for the Ancient Hall!</p><p>As the saying goes, one wrong move and the whole game is lost. They had lost the initiative, but with one more peak expert, they still had a chance.</p><p>A long howl echoed, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>The sea of clouds surged, forming a vast tide of yellow clouds.</p><p>A beam of pure white light shot skyward, faintly revealing Marquis Dingyuan's figure. Bathed in the white light, he resembled a celestial deity, untouched by worldly dust, radiating an aura of sanctity, looking down upon all creation from on high.</p><p>His expression was impassive. He spread his arms, revealing a pious expression, paying homage to the heavens in silent prayer.</p><p>In the next instant, his Saint Wings gently flapped, tracing graceful arcs in the air. His body and limbs moved in unison, each movement filled with power, conforming to a strange rhythm, appearing natural and otherworldly.</p><p>The Gan Qi Heavenly Dance!</p><p>One of the strongest war dances inherited by the Feathered Race, even among the Saint-Winged, only a handful had mastered the Gan Qi War Dance.</p><p>Marquis Dingyuan seemed to have forgotten their disadvantageous situation, forgotten the treasures within the Ancient Hall, completely engrossed in his dance, twirling gracefully in the air.</p><p>At some point, he had donned a suit of armor.  Pure white, without a single blemish, it possessed elegant curves, making his dance even more heroic.  It resembled dance attire rather than battle armor.</p><p>If Qin Sang could witness this scene, he would be astonished, for Marquis Dingyuan's war dance bore a striking resemblance to the ritual dance performed by Ghost Mother!</p><p>Their dances both resonated with heaven and earth. The strange rhythm permeated the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram.  Even with Si Huang and Shao Shi exerting their full power to control the diagram, they couldn't erase this rhythm.  Instead, it wreaked havoc within the diagram.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Mountains crumbled, rivers reversed their flow, and countless plants turned to ash.</p><p>However, Marquis Dingyuan's power alone wasn't enough to break through the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram.  One of his companions also joined the fray.</p><p>This individual wore black armor, their face featureless, like a swirling black mist, constantly shifting. From their back rose black clouds, billowing and transforming into a pair of gigantic black wings.  Clouds and mist surged like burning flames.</p><p>The black-armored figure vanished, leaving only a pair of ever-growing, enormous black wings. With each powerful flap, hurricanes swept across heaven and earth, causing the land to crack and the sea of clouds to roil.</p><p>In a short time, the sky was shrouded in darkness, completely obscured by the gigantic black wings. Against this backdrop, Marquis Dingyuan, dancing beneath the black wings, was exceptionally conspicuous.</p><p>With two peak experts attacking with their full might, even though Si Huang and Shao Shi had seized the initiative, they now felt immense pressure. The slightest lapse in concentration could allow their opponents to break through the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram, ruining all their efforts.</p><p>This was precisely Marquis Dingyuan and his companions’ objective. They held nothing back, aiming to tie down Si Huang and Shao Shi, preventing them from making any further moves.</p><p>The clamor of their divine abilities masked the movements of the third individual. Clad in gray robes and wearing a mask, this person reappeared high in the sky, between the black wings.</p><p>They looked up at the sky with a strange glint in their eyes, then suddenly soared upwards, colliding with the yellow clouds.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram, already violently shaking under the assault of Marquis Dingyuan and the black-armored figure, now suffered another blow.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi floated on either side of the diagram, their eyes closed, remaining calm and collected, but they no longer dared to hold back. They silently channeled their divine abilities.  The eight companion beasts each landed on one of the eight extremes of the diagram, transforming into eight beast-紋ed pillars, supporting heaven and earth.</p><p>The world within the diagram stabilized somewhat. A dense yellow cloud materialized out of thin air, descending heavily upon the third individual!</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>Both Si Huang and Shao Shi were battle-hardened, and their timing was impeccable.  The individual was struck like lightning, their entire body trembling. Even if they weren't seriously injured, their attempt to breach the formation had failed.</p><p>At this moment, a strange transformation occurred.  Primal light emanated from behind the individual's head, revealing a faint, illusory figure within.</p><p>"No!"  Si Huang’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Simultaneously, Marquis Dingyuan’s war dance reached its climax.  White light coalesced between his hands, forming a giant axe, resembling the axe that split open the heavens!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Marquis Dingyuan raised the giant axe high and swung it fiercely at the yellow cloud.  A crescent-shaped white light sliced through the void. Before this white light, everything else paled in comparison.</p><p>The black wings also vibrated violently, forming a sharp black peak, which, almost simultaneously with the axe light, struck the same spot.</p><p>The figure behind the third individual's head materialized, revealing a human body with a bird's head, and three identical heads!</p><p>Six eyes blinked simultaneously.  It was a Nascent Soul, replacing the physical body, appearing like a phantom beneath the axe light.</p><p>Seeing this, Shao Shi's expression also changed.  He urgently warned Qin Sang, "Careful, it's the Youying Clan High Priest!"</p><p>The Youying Clan’s divine abilities were incredibly peculiar. They essentially belonged to the Spirit Cultivator lineage, but they tempered their physical bodies first, then nourished their Nascent Souls with primordial essence.  As their cultivation progressed and they achieved Nascent Soul, their physical bodies would gradually return to normal. However, the Youying Clan had developed many unique Body Cultivator secret techniques that could be deceptively realistic.</p><p>The Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram was the Si You Royal Clan's ultimate treasure, and it also had methods to counter Spirit Cultivators.  However, Body Cultivation and Spirit Cultivation were clearly distinct.  Both Shao Shi and Si Huang had mistaken this individual for a Body Cultivator, leading to a miscalculation.</p><p>Unfortunately, Spirit Cultivators were the most unique of the three lineages.</p><p>The Spirit, Body, and Dharma Cultivator lineages had different cultivation methods and pursued different paths.</p><p>Dharma Cultivators gradually mastered the power of heaven and earth.</p><p>Body Cultivators absorbed the essence of heaven and earth to nurture their own inner worlds.</p><p>Spirit Cultivators, on the other hand, actively merged themselves with heaven and earth to pursue the Heavenly Dao.  Their souls merged with the world, making them the most elusive, coming and going without a trace.</p><p>Of course, the path of cultivation held countless possibilities, with no fixed rules. However, most cultivators of the three lineages chose these three mainstream paths, regardless of their race.</p><p>This demonstrated that Spirit Cultivators were the most difficult to restrain.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The axe light and the black peak struck the yellow cloud one after the other.</p><p>Si Huang hadn’t been boasting. Even such powerful attacks couldn't shatter the Eight Extremes Unfixed Diagram. However, for the Youying Clan High Priest, the cracks created by the impact were more than enough!</p><p>Almost at the same moment Qin Sang received Shao Shi's warning, the three bird heads emerged from the yellow cloud, glancing left and right, then fixing their gaze on Qin Sang, their eyes filled with a mixture of shock and fury.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang was nearing the core of the secret realm. A mere mid-stage Soul Formation cultivator, he had defied the impact of the radiant glow and displayed such astonishing speed, something they hadn't anticipated.</p><p>Sensing the commotion behind him, Qin Sang instinctively glanced back, meeting the gaze of the bird heads.  His heart jolted.</p><p>An eerie light flashed in the eyes of the three bird heads. Qin Sang froze, his ears filled with piercing, strange laughter, his gaze becoming vacant, and his escaping light flickering erratically.</p><p>Qin Sang had clearly fallen prey to the Youying Clan High Priest’s technique. Spirit Cultivator methods were strange and unpredictable, difficult to guard against. If he couldn't break free quickly, he would be flung back by the radiant glow, all his efforts wasted.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi were startled, their hearts sinking.</p><p>The Youying Clan High Priest sneered inwardly.  A mere mid-stage cultivator, even with some ability, how could he withstand his Youying Clan's Soul Nightmare technique!</p><p>However, his smugness was short-lived.  Qin Sang’s eyes flickered with intense struggle, and he let out a fierce roar, his expression and roar filled with pain, as if he had paid a considerable price.</p><p>Just as the lightning was about to extinguish, he broke free from the Youying Clan High Priest's Soul Nightmare technique! Under the astonished gazes of Si Huang and Shao Shi, the lightning exploded, and Qin Sang, with a final burst of speed, charged towards the core of the secret realm, the Myriad Manifestations Pearl flying from his hand.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Thunder Seal appeared, and azure lightning illuminated the Ancient Hall!</p>
