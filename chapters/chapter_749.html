<h1>Chapter 741: Enemies Meet</h1><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang sensed prying eyes.</p><p>He turned to see a figure at a window, nodding to him.</p><p>"Late Jindan stage."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "As expected.  The changes in the Seven Killing Hall, the breaking of the formation by the Wu Clan's high priest, scared many away. Only experts dare participate."</p><p>"I guess the number won't be too large, but I don't know how many teams the East Pole Alliance will send in.  Not only do I not know the mission, I don't even know the leader's identity.  To command so many experts, the leader's cultivation must be at least late Jindan stage.  They wouldn't send a Yuan Ying master, would they?  Even the strongest Jindan cultivator would struggle to participate in conflicts between Yuan Ying cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, entering the wooden building.</p><p>Evening approached.  While meditating in his room, Qin Sang sensed the building's protective barrier being triggered. He beckoned, and a streak of green light, shaped like tadpoles, flew in.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He crushed the light, rose, and walked to the innermost building, finally meeting the leader of this expedition.</p><p>Six people were already seated in the hall, but Qin Sang immediately noticed this one man.</p><p>His cultivation was the highest; even if not peak Jindan, it was very close.</p><p>Dressed in a long robe, he appeared to be in his forties, with sharp eyebrows and piercing eyes, exuding an air of authority.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the man stood and bowed. "Xiang has been waiting for Daoist Qingfeng for some time. I happened to be out on business today and couldn't greet you personally.  I hope you won't mind."</p><p>"Daoist Xiang is too kind."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, curiously glancing at the other five.</p><p>Among them was the man who had greeted him earlier.  Beside him sat a beautiful woman, the two appearing quite intimate, likely a couple.</p><p>The man was a late Jindan stage cultivator, while the woman's cultivation was similar to Qin Sang's, likely having recently broken through to the mid-stage.</p><p>The couple was amiable, greeting Qin Sang proactively.</p><p>To their left, a coldly aloof young man sat alone, sword in hand.  Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, he merely glanced back indifferently, expressionless.</p><p>To the young man's left was an obese man, whose flesh seemed to spill over the chair.</p><p>He managed a smile, his face trembling with fat.</p><p>Both were peak mid-Jindan stage cultivators, likely stuck at a bottleneck and seeking opportunity within the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Lastly, there was a strange man with a half-mask covering his left face.  The mask seemed fused to his bone, covered in blood vessels, his left eye glowing crimson, extremely sinister; he looked like an evil spirit at first glance.</p><p>Compared to him, Qin Sang's hooded appearance seemed unremarkable.</p><p>This person's cultivation was also unusual; superficially mid-Jindan, quite ordinary, but when his evil eye met Qin Sang's, he felt a slight stinging sensation in his own eyes.</p><p>None concealed their cultivation, allowing Qin Sang to easily discern it, but these individuals' strengths couldn't be judged by conventional means.  Those daring enough to enter the Seven Killing Hall surely possessed life-saving techniques.</p><p>"Let me introduce everyone. This is Daoist Qingfeng of the Qiongyu Trading House..."</p><p>After the introductions, they learned each other's origins.</p><p>Besides the leader, the other five, like Qin Sang, were from various trading houses of the East Pole Alliance. The man and woman were indeed a couple, from the same trading house, the man surnamed Liu.</p><p>The leader, Xiang Yi, didn't seem to be from a trading house; his background was mysterious, and Qin Sang wisely refrained from asking.</p><p>After the greetings, Qin Sang sat in a corner.</p><p>"Daoist Xiang, are there only seven of us going to the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>The Liu couple, seemingly familiar with Xiang Yi, asked frankly, "What exactly does the Merchant Alliance want us to do? Daoist Xiang has remained tight-lipped, but surely you can tell us now?"</p><p>"There's one more cultivator from the Nine Stars Society, arriving shortly. Eight of us are sufficient to handle most dangers; more would attract unwanted attention, hindering our actions."</p><p>Xiang Yi said calmly, "As for the Alliance's mission, I cannot disclose it. You will learn upon entering the Seven Killing Hall. This is the Alliance Leader's order; even I dare not disobey."</p><p>Hearing "Nine Stars Society," Qin Sang's face stiffened.  "Could it be?" he thought.</p><p>He knew only one cultivator from the Nine Stars Society.</p><p>The others frowned at Xiang Yi's words. The swordsman's brow furrowed in displeasure.</p><p>The fat man chuckled, saying subtly, "Daoist Xiang, since you cannot reveal the mission details, we dare not defy the Alliance Leader's orders, but surely you can give some indication of the difficulty and time required?  To my knowledge, the outer celestial array of the Seven Killing Hall is formidable. Even if forcibly broken, even the strongest spirit array has limited endurance; we must leave before the array closes."</p><p>"If this task takes too long, leaving us no time for treasure hunting, wouldn't we just be spending our spirit stones working for the Merchant League? What's the point?"</p><p>The fat man looked around, and everyone nodded in agreement. Qin Sang also voiced her support.</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't take offense, his expression unchanged. He calmly said, "Fellow Daoists, rest assured. I can guarantee that this trip will take at most a quarter of your time, leaving you plenty. As long as everyone works together to assist me, and everything goes smoothly, it will be even faster. As for dangers, I can only say that I have made ample preparations. But the Seven Killing Hall is unpredictable; no one can be certain whether unexpected events will occur."</p><p>"That's reassuring, Daoist. I have complete faith in your character."</p><p>The fat man grinned, ceasing further inquiries.</p><p>The others didn't press further, asking a few perfunctory questions while waiting for the last person to arrive.</p><p>Soon, footsteps sounded outside.</p><p>The elderly guard announced, "Master Xiang, Daoist Cui from the Nine Stars Society has arrived."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched.  Looking towards the entrance of the hall, she saw a gaunt young man with a lecherous look in his eyes sauntering in.</p><p>It was Cui Ji.</p><p>Since driving Cui Ji away from Wu Yuan Island years ago, Qin Sang hadn't seen him again.  The man had surprisingly kept a low profile, refraining from further mischief.</p><p>She had initially been wary of his potential revenge.</p><p>But with no further incident, she had let it go.</p><p>Compared to over twenty years ago, Cui Ji's aura was significantly stronger, but his cultivation remained stuck at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, similar to the young man with the sword.</p><p>Furthermore, Cui Ji seemed unwell; excessively thin, pale, and bloodless. He likely suffered setbacks from practicing some forbidden technique.</p><p>"Is this guy also stuck at a bottleneck?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was curious.</p><p>"Daoist Cui has arrived, please be seated," Xiang Yi rose to greet him.</p><p>As Cui Ji was about to sit, he suddenly saw Qin Sang, a flood of unpleasant memories overwhelming him.</p><p>The same hooded cloak, and a very similar aura.</p><p>"Demon! It's you!"</p><p>Cui Ji flew into a rage.</p>
