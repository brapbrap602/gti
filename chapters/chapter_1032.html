<h1>Chapter 1024: The Illusionary Realm</h1><p>Very few could traverse the Glacial Plains as easily as Qin Sang.</p><p>Even those cultivators who hadn't been injured had depleted a significant amount of their True Essence resisting the intense cold.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally noted each of them.  When the time came to compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, these individuals could become his adversaries. Finally, his gaze shifted towards the two pavilions ahead.</p><p>Inside each pavilion was a teleportation formation.</p><p>One led back outside the palace, while the other led to the third trial.</p><p>Without hesitation, and under the surprised gazes of several onlookers, Qin Sang entered the pavilion housing the next trial.</p><p>His vision cleared, and Qin Sang found himself in what appeared to be a canyon.</p><p>An impenetrable fog permeated the area, obscuring his divine sense. It carried a chilling aura, though it was far warmer than the Glacial Plains.</p><p>Distant, shadowy forms loomed, possibly cliffs or the silhouettes of mountains.</p><p>More alarmingly, these shadows seemed to shift and move, sometimes even vanishing entirely.</p><p>From the depths of the fog, the roars of monstrous beasts echoed intermittently.  It was unclear whether someone had entered before him and disturbed the beasts, or if the entire area was infested with them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless. He immediately activated his Demonic Transformation and summoned the Ebony Wood Sword for protection.</p><p>Next, he awakened the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>As Qin Sang observed the scene within the fog, a suspicion began to form in his mind.</p><p>The butterfly landed on his shoulder, nuzzled his chin, and spread its wings, activating its Skyeye.</p><p>The eye on the butterfly's wing came alive, rotating slowly in an unsettling manner.</p><p>With the aid of the Skyeye's power, Qin Sang peered through the fog, focusing on a distant mountain shadow, finally realizing the truth.</p><p>"So, it's an illusionary realmâ€¦"</p><p>He murmured, recalling a detail.</p><p>Among the trials, one was renowned for its illusion formations, known as the Thousand Mountains Formation.</p><p>It was said that the complete Thousand Mountains Formation was an ancient, top-tier illusion array. Utilizing countless mountain peaks as pieces on a game board, once someone entered, they would face endless transformations, forever lost within its depths.</p><p>Naturally, the trial couldn't possibly contain the complete Thousand Mountains Formation; it had to be a fragmented version. However, its power should not be underestimated.</p><p>Due to its unpredictable nature, the Thousand Mountains Formation was considered one of the most dangerous trials.</p><p>Their group was unfortunate enough to encounter it.</p><p>Despite the sight, Qin Sang remained calm. The Skyeye Butterfly's abilities were perfectly suited to counter such illusions. As long as they didn't encounter any high-level beasts, escaping this realm shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang stood still, refraining from any rash actions, using the Skyeye to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Within an illusionary formation, maintaining composure was paramount; panic could lead to disorientation.</p><p>This wasn't a concern for Qin Sang.</p><p>After a brief pause, Qin Sang took his first step.</p><p>The fog parted around him. Inside the canyon, everything appeared normal. Aside from the distant roars, an eerie silence prevailed. Qin Sang could even hear the subtle movement of the fog.</p><p>After a few steps, the Skyeye Butterfly clarified the area he had previously observed.</p><p>There were no mountain shadows at all. Everything was a product of the illusion, their shifting and disappearing mere tricks of the formation.</p><p>After some exploration, Qin Sang gained a general understanding of the formation's mechanisms and quickened his pace.</p><p>Soon, he reached the mouth of the canyon.</p><p>Just then, the fog ahead violently churned, and a jackal-like beast materialized without warning, lunging towards him with bared fangs and claws.</p><p>"An illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. The Skyeye Butterfly had already seen through the beast's true nature.</p><p>He swung his sword with force, cleaving through empty air.</p><p>The illusory beast shattered as the Ebony Wood Sword passed through it.</p><p>In the next instant, identical beasts lunged at Qin Sang from all directions.</p><p>"Three fakes and one real!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the beast attacking from above was real, a surprising revelation.</p><p>He was certain that this beast hadn't been there before; it had appeared out of thin air.  The Thousand Mountains Formation not only created illusions but could also relocate beasts from other areas.</p><p>The interplay of reality and illusion made it incredibly difficult to guard against.</p><p>Fortunately, these illusions were transparent to the Skyeye.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted calmly, channeling True Essence and releasing a circular wave of energy that shattered the remaining illusions.  Then, he pointed two fingers at the real beast and struck.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The beast perished instantly, its corpse falling to the ground, emitting a pungent, bloody odor.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly flicked his finger, sending a burst of flame to incinerate the body and the lingering smell. He then surveyed his surroundings.</p><p>Upon exiting the canyon, Qin Sang saw three mountain shadows standing before him. At his feet were three paths, each leading to one of the peaks, seemingly identical to the naked eye.</p><p>"These must also be a mix of real and fake. I need to find the true path. Cultivators skilled in illusion formations could analyze the shifts in the formation to find the exit, but otherwise, the only option is to try each path. The rumors are true; this place is a dangerous blend of reality and illusion."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, urging the Skyeye Butterfly to fully utilize its Skyeye ability.</p><p>Quickly, the butterfly ruled out the mountain on the left.</p><p>The end of that path was an illusion.</p><p>However, to Qin Sang's surprise, the other two paths were real, showing no flaws.</p><p>"Does the Thousand Mountains Formation have multiple exits, requiring me to choose the correct one from the two remaining paths?"</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of the formation was limited, making it difficult to determine the best course of action.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace opened only once every three hundred years or so, and the Thousand Mountains Formation appeared even less frequently, leaving very little information available. He had to rely on his own judgment.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang started walking towards the central mountain.</p><p>He proceeded slowly, allowing the Skyeye Butterfly to observe the surroundings.</p><p>With the Ebony Wood Sword leading the way, he reached the foot of the mountain without encountering any danger.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, glancing up at the summit. After a moment, he stepped onto the first stone step. Suddenly, his eyes flickered, and he swung his sword towards empty space on his right.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A beast, before it could fully materialize, was struck by the Ebony Wood Sword and sent flying, whimpering as it died instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, a disturbance appeared on his right.</p><p>"An illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang casually waved his hand, sending out a burst of spiritual energy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the energy was easily shattered upon contact with its target.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>"Awooo!"</p><p>The beast that should have been an illusion howled, its jaws wide as it lunged to bite him.</p><p>The stench of blood filled the air.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>The Skyeye couldn't be wrong.</p><p>However, the Thousand Mountains Formation was truly bizarre. It could transform illusion into reality, relocating a real beast at the moment of contact. If a cultivator wasn't careful, they could be seriously injured.</p><p>Fortunately, this beast wasn't powerful, likely just an appetizer, a warning to those who entered.</p><p>Qin Sang sidestepped slightly, using the Ebony Wood Sword to slay the beast.</p><p>He waited for a moment, observing the formation for any further changes before continuing his ascent.</p><p>Every few steps, he was assaulted by beasts, sometimes real, sometimes illusory, and their nature would shift unpredictably, a constant annoyance that demanded vigilance even against illusions.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang increased his pace, reaching the mountaintop.</p>
