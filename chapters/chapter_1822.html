Chapter 1813: Poison Essence


Entering this place, Qin Sang encountered all sorts of strangeness.
The Jade-White Elder appeared to be just an ordinary statue.
Yet, a black skeleton knelt before it, prostrating itself in utmost reverence.
That the black skeleton could enter here meant its cultivation before death couldn't have been weak.
For a cultivator of no low cultivation to be so devout, they were either controlled or there truly was a deity here.
Qin Sang was secretly vigilant, calmly examining the mountain cave, and discovered a brocade pouch beneath the black skeleton.
The pouch was brightly colored, surely a treasure.
Besides this, he found no other magical tools or jade slips. The pouch was likely a spatial storage artifact.
Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed the skeleton's posture was abnormal, twisted and broken in several places. It had suffered grievous injuries before death.
He immediately thought of the broken bones outside the stone door. This skeleton was complete; the broken bones must belong to someone else. A fight had taken place here.
"Internal strife or external enemies?"
Qin Sang pondered silently.
The restriction on the hidden door could block the Flower Spirit's perception, but it was unclear whether it could resist malevolent spirits.
They might have been attacked by malevolent spirits before their deaths, or perhaps they killed each other.
The corpse had decomposed to bone, indicating a long time since death. The place was littered with white bones, and no useful traces could be found.
However, these discoveries were enough to make Qin Sang wary. The Jade-White Elder, the malevolent spirits of unknown origin, and perhaps even a nest of malevolent spirits â€“ everything seemed so unusual.
"The world has Daoist Heavenly Gods, Demon Gods, and naturally, Evil Gods..."
Qin Sang took one last look at the Jade-White Elder, pondered for a moment, and slowly retreated.
He returned behind the stone door and sat down cross-legged.
He chose not to step into the cave or probe the Jade-White Elder with his divine sense, nor did he take the pouch. Qin Sang worried that rash actions would invite trouble, putting him in a precarious situation, beset by enemies both within and without.
His current state was poor. He urgently needed to resolve the accumulated toxins within his body. Since there was no immediate danger, he should heal his injuries and recover his strength as quickly as possible.
The mountain's belly was tranquil, a world apart from the outside.
During this time, the stone door remained stable, confirming the Flower Spirit wouldn't force its way in.
Qin Sang instructed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to stand guard, mainly against the statue inside, not the Flower Spirit outside.
He calmed his mind and focused, urging the Poison Pearl to refine the intense poison within his body.
After careful discernment, Qin Sang found the connections between these virulent poisons. The poison in the poisonous water, the poisonous restriction on the seventh archway of the palace, the poison of the malevolent spirits, and even the restriction on the hidden door were all intricately linked to the flower poison in the fields.
Qin Sang guessed that the hidden door used flower poison for its restriction, which was why it could isolate the Flower Spirit's perception.
This showed that the White Bone Flower Field was the foundation of this poisonous domain.
The flower poison in the field was fused with the Flower Spirit's resentment, making it even more potent. If handled carelessly, allowing the resentful poison to invade one's mind and spirit would also be a significant problem.
Qin Sang naturally didn't fear this, treating it as ordinary virulent poison. With the situation unclear and needing to recover quickly, he didn't try to have the Poison Pearl absorb it, but instead circulated the Poison Dispelling Radiance to expel it.
Soon, faint black qi emerged from Qin Sang's skin, followed by flickering multicolored light as wisps of poisonous qi were expelled.
These poisonous qi drifted towards Qin Sang's chest, confined by a layer of Poison Dispelling Radiance, unable to disperse.
Gradually, less poison was expelled from his body. Qin Sang's complexion finally returned to normal. He exhaled a long breath of turbid air and slowly came to.
Divine light shone in his eyes, seemingly fully recovered!
Qin Sang glanced at the poison qi before him, his palm closing as if grasping air. The poison qi contracted into a bead, but its color was mottled, far less pure than the orbs within the malevolent spirits.
He casually stored it in the Thousand Jun Ring, glanced at the hidden door, and walked towards the interior of the cave.
The Jade-White Elder remained as before, standing at the altar, unchanged.
With renewed confidence, Qin Sang boldly examined the Jade-White Elder, his gaze finally settling on the brocade pouch. With a wave of his hand, the pouch flew to him.
As expected, it was a spatial storage artifact.
The previous owner hadn't left any special restrictions on the pouch, saving Qin Sang some effort.
Opening the pouch, its contents were revealed.
After careful examination, Qin Sang gradually frowned.
The pouch contained mostly trivial items, not what Qin Sang had expected. He found nothing to prove the black skeleton's identity, no jade slips, nothing to determine its origins through cultivation techniques or secret arts.
He could only conclude that this person was extremely skilled in the Dao of Poison.
Unfortunately, there were no records related to the flower field. He still had to find his own way out.
Qin Sang glanced at the Jade-White Elder, pondered for a moment, and decided to go outside first.
He was eager to leave for two reasons: to thoroughly understand this space and to search for True Monarch Qing Dan and Bo Xian Shanren.
If the two True Monarchs had also unfortunately fallen into the flower field and couldn't leave, they would be nearing their limits.
They had explored this place many times and must know some unknown secrets, perhaps even the origin of the flower field and the way out.
Qin Sang always planned his escape route first. He would explore the Jade-White Elder after securing a retreat. If anything went wrong, he could escape in time.
There was another reason for his caution.
Qin Sang analyzed the flower poison, but he couldn't connect it to the strange poison that killed several True Lineage disciples of Lou Gu Mountain, suggesting other dangers lurked here.
He quickly returned to the door, his palm touching the stone.  While detoxifying earlier, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had clearly observed the network of restrictions on the stone door, imprinting it in its memory.
With a flash of light, Qin Sang appeared outside the stone door.
The flower field, which had returned to tranquility, immediately became agitated. Flower Spirits and clouds of resentful poison surged forth, frantically pursuing Qin Sang.
Flying into the sky and surveying his surroundings, he saw no unusual signs amongst the towering peaks. Then, Qin Sang urged his Thunder Escape, soaring over the mountains and ridges, heading back towards the deepest part of the flower field.
The two deepest flower fields corresponded to two main halls. Qin Sang had previously fallen into the left flower field, and now he was going to the other one.
Sword techniques and thunder arts erupted, clearing a path.
Delicate spiritual flowers and piles of white bones came into view. The bones in this flower field were pure white, of excellent quality.
Countless Flower Spirits rushed towards him. There were no malevolent spirits, and he also couldn't find the two True Monarchs.
He didn't know if Flower Spirits devoured flesh and blood. If the two True Monarchs had perished here, they might have already turned into white bones.
His divine sense swept across the entire flower field, finding no trace of the two True Monarchs' belongings.
Then, Qin Sang suddenly stared at the area behind the flower field. According to the palace's layout, there shouldn't be any flower fields there, only mountains and ridges.
Now, however, Qin Sang noticed something seemed amiss.
'Crack!'
The Five Thunders Heaven-Heart Seal reappeared, annihilating the Flower Spirits. Qin Sang flew higher, getting a clearer view.
Directly behind the two flower fields, a few mountain peaks were significantly darker than the surrounding area, as if shrouded in a layer of gray mist, shadowy and indistinct, eerily unfathomable.
Looking at it for a while longer, Qin Sang felt a sense of dread.
At his level of cultivation, his spiritual sense was so acute that illusions were nearly impossible. There was only one possibility: that place was extremely dangerous!
Qin Sang had no intention of personally investigating. He immediately retreated from the flower field, speeding outwards, flying over one flower field after another until he reached the position corresponding to the palace gates.
The result was disappointing. Qin Sang couldn't find a way out, nor could he find the two True Monarchs.
He continued to fly outwards. The size of this space exceeded his imagination, but he eventually reached the edge of the mountains.
The edge of the space, like the sky, was sealed by a distorting force.
His search fruitless, and with a large amount of flower poison accumulating in his body, Qin Sang had no choice but to return to the cave.
Having lost their target, the Flower Spirits dispersed, returning to their flower cocoons to slumber.
The area gradually returned to normal, but with a lingering sense of deathly stillness permeating the entire space.
Before Qin Sang's intrusion, this space had always been like this, for an unknown number of years. Even the dancing of the Flower Spirits couldn't erase that sense of deathly stillness.
Stroking the stone door, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.
Then, his fingers flickered, sending streams of hand seals into the stone door, merging with the poison restriction, bringing it under his control.
This wouldn't change the power of the poison restriction, but it allowed Qin Sang to manipulate it more easily and observe the outside world through it.
The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew out of his Qi Sea, circled Qin Sang, and then merged into the restriction with a flash, capturing the entire sky in its view.
Qin Sang sat cross-legged behind the stone door once more, his mind connected to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, detoxifying himself while observing the force that sealed the space.
After a while, Qin Sang finally noticed something!
His Heaven's Eye locked onto a certain point in the sky. Qin Sang's brow furrowed, as if he was fully engrossed in deducing something.
Gradually, Qin Sang's brow relaxed.
If he wasn't mistaken, beyond that point should be a swirling mist, one of the passages out of this space!
Knowing the way out, Qin Sang's expression softened. He kept the Heaven's Eye Butterfly observing the outside and entered the cave for the third time.
Now without any worries, Qin Sang extended a strand of his divine sense directly towards the Jade-White Elder.
A moment later, Qin Sang revealed a look of surprise.
His divine sense penetrated the white jade, discovering it was not a statue, but also no ordinary object. It actually contained a hidden scripture, like a jade slip!
Breaking the seal, profound scriptures instantly appeared in Qin Sang's mind, titled *Poison God Canon*!
From the name, it seemed to be a sacred text of the Dao of Poison.
Qin Sang's heart stirred. He immediately began to examine it carefully.  Halfway through, he gasped, shock filling his eyes. He murmured, "The flower field was actually artificially created, a fertile field for cultivating poison!  White bones as fertilizer, gathering the dew of poisonous flowers..."
Just then, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly suddenly transmitted a thought. Qin Sang withdrew his attention and "saw" the scene outside the mountain through the butterfly.
At that moment, a point in the sky exhibited unusual fluctuations in the distorting force, forming a vortex in the air.
This was an external force.
However, the vortex was distorted and struggling to take shape. It was evident that this force was trying to break through the sky but couldn't penetrate the distorting force, only managing to maintain a fragile vortex.
Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood. It was likely the two True Monarchs outside, attempting to rescue him.
So they had already escaped.
This was indeed the case. True Monarch Qing Dan had explored the poisonous domain many times. Although she didn't know the truth about it, she had discovered some signs and secrets, only understanding fully when the palace transformed.
However, although they had escaped danger, they were also seriously injured.  Suppressing the virulent poison within their bodies, they hurriedly recovered some strength, found a swirling mist, and attempted to rescue Qin Sang.
As long as Qin Sang was still alive and saw the celestial phenomenon, they could work together from the inside and outside to escape.
"They are trustworthy people."
Qin Sang nodded secretly.
In this world's Daoist sect, there were demons and devils watching from the outside, but the internal order was well-maintained.  There were endless demonic beasts and ferocious beasts to slay, unlike the resource-scarce Storm Realm.  The Daoist cultivators he encountered mostly focused on cultivating both body and mind, upholding righteousness.
There was even a saying circulating within the Daoist sect: If one cultivates to nourish life, one must first accumulate deeds and merits. With merit but no deeds, Dao fruition is difficult.  Merit and deeds together make a True Person.
However, Qin Sang didn't respond to the two True Monarchs.  This *Poison God Canon* had broadened his horizons, and he didn't want to leave just yet.
"Since they are safe, there's no need to meet them now. I'll just make an excuse later..."
The spiritual formation of this space was recorded in the *Poison God Canon*. Those who didn't understand spiritual formations could only enter and exit the flower field through the sole entrance, the spiritual tree in the palace.
The palace was a facade, a deception.
The palace originally had restrictions hiding the spiritual tree. Perhaps due to the passage of time and being within the constantly shifting Altar of Governance, the spiritual formation was damaged, causing the spiritual tree to appear, and even a portion of the flower field to bleed into reality, forming the swirling mist.
The three of them had been unaware of this before. True Monarch Qing Dan uprooting the spiritual tree destroyed the entrance, causing the palace to collapse and the terrifying sight of distorted void to appear in its place, intensifying over time.
Even through the swirling mist, it was easier to go out than to come in.
The vortex in the sky held for a while, then finally dissipated.  The two True Monarchs received no response, assuming the worst had happened to Qin Sang. They could only leave the poisonous domain and resolve the poison within their bodies.
Qin Sang was now completely absorbed in studying the *Poison God Canon*.
At first, he was only shocked by the origin of the White Bone Flower Field.
As he finished reading the entire *Poison God Canon*, he was immediately stunned by the profound methods within.
Undoubtedly, this was a sacred text of the Dao of Poison, a superior inheritance. It likely didn't originate from the Daoist sect, because the *Poison God Canon* didn't mention any Dharma Bodies.
It was no longer possible to tell what Dharma Body the black skeleton cultivated during its life.
The Daoist sect probably wouldn't have such a sinister method of piling corpses into fields and using white bones to cultivate poison.
It was certain that the black skeleton had cultivated the *Poison God Canon* during its life.
Qin Sang took out two jade slips, the poison refining body secret art he obtained from True Monarch Qing Dan.
This secret art originated from the *Poison God Canon*, but it was only a part of the inheritance and not the core. It was a special secret art specifically used to aid cultivation.
The *Poison God Canon* was even more radical. Its core method was to introduce poison into the body, refining poison and transforming it into essence, cultivating Poison Essence to rapidly increase one's cultivation.
The White Bone Flower Field was a medicinal field. The Flower Spirits weren't inherently spiritual beings, but a rare type of poisonous flower. The flower dew they produced was a superior poison, one of the most suitable poisons for cultivating Poison Essence!
Cultivating with virulent poison, the dangers were self-evident.
During cultivation, it was inevitable that residual poison would accumulate within the body. As the virulent poison accumulated and became impossible to suppress, there would be a day when the poison erupted, resulting in death.
Thus, there was the poison tempering body secret art, using the residual poison to temper the physical body. Firstly, to clear the residual poison, and secondly, to strengthen the physical body, increasing one's resistance to virulent poison, achieving a unique form of body and Dharma dual cultivation.
However, this was like drinking poison to quench thirst. It couldn't truly resolve the hidden danger. While cultivation increased, so did the root of the virulent poison. After beginning cultivation, one couldn't stop, or the virulent poison would immediately erupt.
Unless one's cultivation or physical body broke through to a higher realm before the poison erupted, there was no hope of survival.
Cultivating this method was akin to racing against the poison within one's body.
Used properly, it was a wondrous technique. Otherwise, it was a path to self-destruction. This black skeleton was a vivid example!
