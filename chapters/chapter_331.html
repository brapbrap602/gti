Chapter 324: Soul-Gathering Grass

The burly man held only three Thousand-Vine Flowers.

The potency of spiritual medicines varied greatly, making it difficult to determine their exact value.  But judging by the atmosphere in the auction hall, the Soul-Nourishing Fruit would undoubtedly fetch a high price. After weighing the pros and cons, most people began to back down.

However, the Thousand-Vine Flower was also a rare spiritual medicine.  It seemed that many were attempting to bypass bidding on the Soul-Nourishing Fruit and trade directly with the burly man.

Overwhelmed, the man cupped his hands and announced loudly, "I only wish to exchange for a Soul-Nourishing Fruit, or a similar elixir that can nourish the soul.  Fellow Daoists, if you do not possess such an item, please save your breath."

Despite this brief commotion, the auction of the Soul-Nourishing Fruit proceeded uninterrupted, the price steadily climbing.

Unfortunately, many were vying for the fruit, driving the price far beyond its inherent value.  A few who were interested in the Thousand-Vine Flowers made a few attempts to raise their bids, but eventually retreated.

Qin Sang made two bids before deciding to give up.

It wasn't worth spending so much on a few Thousand-Vine Flowers that held no immediate use for him.

Ultimately, the Soul-Nourishing Fruit was claimed by a female cultivator at a price that left the burly man in despair.  She clearly had no intention of trading for the flowers; it seemed the Soul-Nourishing Fruit was precisely what she needed.

Dejected, the man slumped back in his chair.

Some persisted in trying to negotiate a trade with him, but he refused them all.

The auction continued without pause, with various items being sold.  Sadly, nothing else with similar properties to the Soul-Nourishing Fruit appeared.

"The next item! Soul-Gathering Grass!"

Gao Yi's enthusiastic voice jolted Qin Sang.  He had been cautious in his previous bids, reluctantly purchasing only a Phoenix-Fall Vine of similar quality to the Earthfire Tung, for fear of depleting his spirit stones before the Soul-Gathering Grass appeared.

Finally, the moment had arrived!

*Swish!*

Gao Yi whipped away the red cloth, revealing three jade boxes arranged side by side on the tray!

Inside each box was a Soul-Gathering Grass plant, dug up roots and all!

The Soul-Gathering Grass was jet black. Three leaves sprouted from its base, not in separate directions, but intertwined like vines, converging at the top to form a bud-like shape, a peculiar sight.

During its growth, the Soul-Gathering Grass transitioned through white, green, dark green, and finally, jet black â€“ a sign of maturity!

The appearance of the Soul-Gathering Grass caused an uproar in the hall, with several gasps of astonishment.

Some even leaped to their feet, eyes fixed on the tray, burning with fervor.

Many cultivators who had previously spent lavishly now sighed with regret.

Qin Sang's heart tightened; he had a bad feeling.  It seemed he had underestimated the allure of the Soul-Gathering Grass to demonic and unorthodox cultivators.

Each leaf could be refined into a Celestial Corpse Talisman, meaning one plant could yield three. While there was a chance of failure, Qin Sang had been studying the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture* for some time and was confident he could refine at least two.

Judging by the frenzied reactions, the competition for the Soul-Gathering Grass would be fierce.  Qin Sang didn't dare hope to acquire all three plants.

He would preemptively strike, sparing no expense to secure the first plant, then assess the situation for the remaining two.

Qin Sang made up his mind.

With his resources, he should be able to secure the first plant, though the price would likely exceed his expectations.

Still, obtaining at least two living corpses would be worth it.

"Three mature Soul-Gathering Grass plants, beneficial to the cultivation techniques of many demonic and unorthodox Daoist friends. It seems everyone is aware of their value. I will only briefly introduce..."

Gao Yi announced the starting price with a slight smirk.

"The owner requires that all three Soul-Gathering Grass plants be auctioned together, preferring them to go unsold rather than be separated.  The starting bid is one talismanic treasure with at least 70% of its power remaining, preferably an offensive type!"

All three together!

Not spirit stones, nor artifacts, nor elixirs, but a talismanic treasure!

This condition doused the heated atmosphere like a bucket of cold water.

Silence fell over the hall as everyone exchanged bewildered glances.

How many among these Foundation Establishment cultivators were fortunate enough to possess a talismanic treasure?

Furthermore, the requirement of 70% remaining power was extremely demanding.

"This old man offers 7,000 low-grade spirit stones to purchase a talismanic treasure in exchange for the Soul-Gathering Grass.  Would any fellow Daoist be willing to part with one?" a raspy voice called out.

7,000 low-grade spirit stones could buy two high-quality top-grade artifacts.  It was a fair price for a talismanic treasure.

However, no one would sell at that price.

"7,000 spirit stones for a talismanic treasure?  You jest, fellow Daoist!  I offer 7,500!" another voice immediately countered.

"8,000!"

...

The price climbed to 9,000 spirit stones, with only a few still able to compete.

Yet, only their voices echoed in the hall. No one responded; clearly, mere spirit stones were insufficient to tempt those who possessed talismanic treasures.

"Two top-grade artifacts, plus 2,000 spirit stones! Will anyone trade?"

Finally, someone offered alternative items for exchange.  The strained tone in his voice betrayed his reluctance; he was likely offering his own personal artifacts.

Qin Sang, having participated in the bidding, quickly realized this approach wouldn't work. He carefully observed the crowd.

Gao Yi stood on the platform, a smile playing on his lips as he watched the bidding war unfold.

Below, several people were communicating with Gao Yi through voice transmissions. Qin Sang could guess their intentions: they hoped to purchase the Soul-Gathering Grass plants separately or negotiate other terms.

They seemed to have been refused, each sighing in disappointment.

Finally, Qin Sang noticed a few individuals who caught his attention.

A woman in red.

A Daoist priest in a dark blue-green robe, his face uncovered by any artifacts.

A lean young man clad in armor.

A boy who looked no older than a teenager, a faint smile playing on his lips.

...

They shared a common trait: their auras were remarkably subtle, unreadable to Qin Sang. He suspected they were likely late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.

These individuals were all fixated on the Soul-Gathering Grass, silent, seemingly weighing the value of exchanging a talismanic treasure.  They ignored the escalating bids, completely unmoved.

This raised a red flag for Qin Sang.

The auction house at Yin Mountain Pass was renowned, attracting many powerful cultivators. It was not unusual for a few to possess talismanic treasures.

For these individuals, spirit stones and top-grade artifacts were not necessities. Only equally rare treasures could entice them.

Even if he offered his spirit stones, artifacts, and the near-broken Silver Knife talismanic treasure, he would at best be locked in a stalemate.

Besides those, he only had two thousand-year-old spiritual medicines of value.

If he was unwilling to part with the medicines, and the price continued to rise, he would be the first to give up.  His resources simply couldn't compare to theirs.
