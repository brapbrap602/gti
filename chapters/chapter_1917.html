<h1>Chapter 1908: The Daoist Descends the Mountain</h1><p>This was the perfect opportunity to take Xiao Wu into the mortal realm, let her experience the ways of the world, and test his theory.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat upright, her dark eyes fixed solely on Qin Sang, her master, indifferent to everything else.  Only when Zhu Que flitted before her would she glance at it, behaving impeccably.</p><p>Yet, this very obedience felt unnatural.</p><p>A newborn ‘infant’ should be curious about the unfamiliar world, not so apathetic.</p><p>Zhu Que, with its keen senses, also noticed something amiss and obediently returned to Qin Sang's side, no longer daring to excessively tease Xiao Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang, with a plan forming, raised a finger and tapped the void before him.  Spiritual energy pulsed, and the image of a Daoist materialized.</p><p>The Daoist bore a slight resemblance to Qin Sang, wearing a square cap, tall and elegant, clad in a simple green robe and plain shoes, his demeanor otherworldly.</p><p>With a subtle shift of his eyes, the Daoist's expression became animated, exuding a unique aura. He bowed to Qin Sang with a graceful, carefree gesture.</p><p>Upon reaching the Void Refinement Realm, some things transcended mere 'techniques.'</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't employed any secret art.</p><p>This was another profound application he'd gleaned from his Dharma Body, akin to the avatars of deities and Buddhas in myths and legends.</p><p>The avatar would venture into the world, while the true body remained in the Daoist sanctuary to cultivate, achieving both without hindering the other.</p><p>Naturally, this avatar couldn't compare to those cultivated through the superior avatar and clone techniques passed down through the top Immortal Sects, each with its unique advantages.</p><p>“Something's missing…”</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his chin, scrutinizing the avatar. With a flicker of thought, subtle changes appeared in the avatar's features, adding a touch of world-weariness.</p><p>“Now he looks like a wandering Daoist.”</p><p>Satisfied, Qin Sang beckoned with his hand. A radiant treasure within the fire chamber suddenly brightened, flying out of its own accord and piercing through the air.</p><p>The avatar turned towards the entrance, raising his right hand. The radiant treasure flew precisely into the cave dwelling, landing in his hand.</p><p>This treasure was none other than the Earth Traveling Boat Qin Sang had acquired from the Demonic Roc's remains.</p><p>Next, a flash of green light emanated from Qin Sang, revealing a human-shaped spiritual wood – the Dao Manifestation Tree refined using the Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Dao Manifestation Tree merged into the avatar, whose body instantly solidified, as if he possessed a true flesh and blood form.</p><p>This avatar possessed only Nascent Soul stage strength but could manipulate Heavenly Yuan Qi to a certain degree, while ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators could only borrow Heavenly Might.</p><p>With the Dao Manifestation Tree, the avatar could exhibit even greater power in places rich with wood spiritual energy.</p><p>Moreover, Xiao Wu would accompany him.</p><p>While this avatar, venturing into the mortal world, couldn't utilize the Return to Origin technique beyond a thousand miles from the sanctuary, Qin Sang's true body could still perceive the avatar's experiences.</p><p>Should any unforeseen circumstances arise, his true body could instantly react.  Besides, it was merely a journey through the mortal realm, and Qin Sang believed he wouldn't encounter any insurmountable problems.</p><p>“Take these as well…”</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense immersed itself within the altar, connecting with the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal. He imprinted the seal's scriptures and secret manuals, transforming them into a beam of spiritual light that shot into the avatar's forehead.</p><p>The avatar, wandering the mortal realm, could comprehend the Thunder Arts in his leisure.</p><p>In the future, the Daoist Thunder Arts might become his crucial reliance.</p><p>“I want to go too! I want to go too!”</p><p>Witnessing Qin Sang's preparations, Zhu Que seemed to have guessed his intentions, its eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Surrounded by magma and fire, it rarely saw another soul. With Qin Sang constantly in seclusion, it could only explore the surroundings with the Fire Jade Centipede, a life it found utterly tedious.</p><p>How could such an exciting adventure into the mortal realm be complete without it?</p><p>This creature’s mind was clearly not on cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, saying, “Conceal the markings on your feathers, and I might consider taking you along.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Zhu Que hopped to the entrance, its face filled with alarm.</p><p>Its most distinguishing feature, setting it apart from common fire crows, was its unique and beautiful plumage, which it frequently admired.</p><p>Concealing its markings would make it as ugly as those fire crows.</p><p>“Then stay on the mountain and keep the Fire Jade Centipede company!”</p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy, waving his hand. The stone door slammed shut with a 'bang.'</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Luo Hou and Gui Hou, training the demonic soldiers, sensed a shift in energy atop the mountain. Looking up, they saw a Daoist emerge from the summit cave.</p><p>The Daoist, holding a young girl's hand, descended the mountain on clouds, landing by the lake.</p><p>Zhu Que circled them excitedly.</p><p>“Follow them down the mountain.”</p><p>Luo Hou, hearing Qin Sang's voice, responded respectfully without hesitation: “By your command.”</p><p>Luo Hou summoned a demonic wind, swiftly pursuing the Daoist and landing beside him.</p><p>It belonged to the Shadow Horse lineage, but having awakened the Cloud-Soaring Azure Lightning Beast bloodline, its body was covered in azure scales, with lightning flickering between them, making it far more majestic and powerful than a typical Shadow Horse.</p><p>A flash of azure light.</p><p>Luo Hou concealed its scales and lightning, suppressing its otherworldly aura. Its size also diminished, transforming into a rather impressive azure horse. It stamped its hooves, snorting softly.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially subdued Luo Hou, intending for it to aid him in traversing Mount Juzhi and accessing the altar. He had promised to help it find a suitable physical body, but unforeseen events had delayed this until now.  This journey would allow them to fulfill that promise.</p><p>A flicker of envy flashed across Gui Hou's eyes. Luo Hou, becoming the mount of the master's avatar, would enjoy constant proximity, an opportunity anyone would covet.</p><p>Without the master's permission, it could only watch enviously.</p><p>However, remaining as the guardian spirit beast of the Daoist sanctuary wasn't without its benefits.  Occasionally receiving a few words of guidance from the master was immensely rewarding.</p><p>Over a hundred years ago, it had achieved a breakthrough to the mid-Nascent Soul stage thanks to such guidance.</p><p>Gui Hou lay on a grey rock at the foot of the mountain, watching Luo Hou depart, lost in thought.</p><p>Atop the mountain.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly, now in the late Fifth Transformation stage, perched on Qin Sang's true body's shoulder, watching the departing figures alongside its master.</p><p>Under the setting sun.</p><p>The Daoist, holding the little girl's hand, appeared to stroll leisurely, yet each step covered a hundred zhang with ease.</p><p>An azure horse followed closely behind, without needing reins.</p><p>An unruly fire crow, sometimes perched on the horse's head, sometimes on the Daoist's shoulder, chattered incessantly, disrupting the tranquil scene.</p><p>A Daoist, a little girl, a bird, and a horse.</p><p>They gradually disappeared into the distant mountains.</p><p>…</p><p>The mortal realm lay to the south.</p><p>They didn't employ any special movement techniques, traveling south at a steady pace.</p><p>This region was indeed sparsely populated. They journeyed for a considerable time without encountering a single soul.  Only a few times did they sense faint auras within the mountains, likely from cultivators in secluded cultivation.</p><p>Continuing southward, the subterranean fire veins gradually calmed, and the landscape began to change. The ceaseless flames began to recede.</p><p>Further on, the dense network of magma rivers would transition into an equally desolate desert.</p><p>They should soon encounter signs of cultivator activity.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stopped. Xiao Wu, noticing, also halted, tilting her small head up and looking at Qin Sang with questioning eyes.</p><p>Throughout their journey, Qin Sang hadn't spoken much, and Xiao Wu had patiently followed him without asking questions.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted Xiao Wu and placed her on the horse's back, gently closing her eyes.  He instructed, “Xiao Wu, don’t open your eyes from now on.  In the presence of others, call me Master.”</p><p>Xiao Wu complied without resistance, her eyes closed, softly saying, “Master.”</p><p>Zhu Que, perched on the horse's head, was nodding off, jolted awake by their conversation.  It opened its beak to speak but was silenced by Qin Sang’s sharp glare.</p><p>“There's no one else here, what’s wrong with this Zhu Que saying a few words…”</p><p>Zhu Que muttered under its breath.</p><p>Before their descent, Qin Sang had set many rules for it, including refraining from speaking freely.</p><p>For the sake of this outing, it had to endure this humiliation!</p><p>…</p><p>The wind howled, carrying scorching waves of heat from the north.  Fragile vegetation couldn't withstand these scorching winds, leaving only endless yellow sand without a single oasis in sight.</p><p>It was virtually impossible for mortals to survive here.</p><p>However, for cultivators, these heat waves were nothing.</p><p>Located at the edge of the fire domain, this area was far less perilous than the domain itself, offering easy access to its treasures, making it an ideal resting place.</p><p>For countless years, marketplaces had spontaneously formed here, eventually merging into towns as time passed. The name Four Fires Town had persisted to this day.</p><p>The name originated from a fire vein that once flowed through the area, enveloping the town in flames on all sides.</p><p>Even after the vein's disappearance, the name remained unchanged.</p><p>Cultivators who came here knew that Four Fires Town was safe, housing not only cultivators from all corners but also their descendants living within the town walls.</p><p>The town bustled with activity.</p><p>Four Fires Town had walls on all four sides, but these were mostly symbolic. The town's true protection came from a grand formation.</p><p>The four city gates remained open, allowing free passage.</p><p>“Judging by this, is the Ember Wind approaching?”</p><p>At the western gate, people queued to enter the town. Two individuals, feeling the intensifying heat wave from behind, scanned their surroundings. One of them spoke.</p><p>The Ember Wind was a natural disaster, a fire-laden wind blowing from the fire domain, resembling a celestial fire engulfing everything.</p><p>Not only was the sight terrifying, but its power was also formidable.</p><p>A powerful Ember Wind could force even Foundation Establishment cultivators to seek refuge within Four Fires Town.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” the other person shook his head. “I heard that before the last Ember Wind, the sky turned crimson as if ablaze, and cultivators scavenging in the fire domain fled in panic, swarming into the town.”</p><p>As they spoke, they suddenly noticed figures appearing faintly in the northwest, amidst the wind and sand.</p><p>“Could it be?  Someone actually made it back?”</p><p>The man's face filled with astonishment. Then he saw a peculiar group.</p><p>Upon seeing the small figure on horseback, he couldn’t help but frown. “Why would anyone bring a child to such a dangerous place?”</p><p>Four Fires Town was safe, but only within its walls.  A delicate child like that could be obliterated by the mere aftershocks of a cultivator’s battle.</p><p>“Be careful what you say!”</p><p>His companion clamped a hand over his mouth, warning him with a look.</p><p>The newcomers were unfamiliar faces.  Who knew what abilities they possessed, daring to travel with a child?</p><p>Four Fires Town was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Careless words could invite disaster, as had been proven time and again.</p><p>Those at the city gate noticed the newcomers, silently observing them.</p><p>“That's a fine horse!”</p><p>“Such a spirited little girl, why doesn't she open her eyes?  A pity she's blind…”</p><p>…</p><p>Fleeting whispers arose from the crowd, their origins unclear.</p><p>“Xiao Wu, Four Fires Town is just ahead. What do you sense?” Qin Sang asked with a smile.</p><p>“So many people…”</p><p>Although her eyes were closed, Xiao Wu perceived everything clearly.</p><p>“Indeed, all sorts of people.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, approaching the two men who had been discussing them.  He bowed slightly, saying, “Excuse me, fellow Daoists.  I’m new here and weary from my travels. Could you tell me where I might find lodging and food?”</p><p>“The largest inn in the town is the Gathering Immortals Inn. They say their ingredients are all from spirit beasts hunted in the fire domain…”</p><p>“The Gathering Immortals Inn also has cave dwellings, but they're a bit pricey…”</p><p>The two men chimed in, directing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them and joined the queue.</p><p>“He’s definitely a master!”</p><p>The two men exchanged glances, seeing that Qin Sang had immediately settled on the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p><p>They couldn't sense his cultivation level, indicating he either possessed a treasure that concealed his aura or his cultivation far surpassed theirs.</p><p>Anyone could enter the town upon paying the required spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang encountered no obstacles, leading his horse into the town.  He navigated the streets and alleys, heading towards the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p><p>The Gathering Immortals Inn lived up to its name.</p><p>In the center of Four Fires Town, aside from a few secluded mansions, stood the inn.  Mortals were forbidden entry.</p><p>While scorching winds raged outside, the inn's surroundings were picturesque, with small bridges and flowing water.</p><p>As Qin Sang and Xiao Wu arrived at the inn's entrance, a waiter noticed them and hurried forward.</p><p>He lifted Xiao Wu down from the horse's back.</p><p>The waiter deftly took the reins, gently holding them, and inquired warmly, “Would the honored guests like a room or a meal?  I can take your spirit horse to a cave dwelling to rest.”</p><p>A cultivator's horse was no ordinary steed.</p><p>It wasn't uncommon for guests to bring spirit beasts, and the Gathering Immortals Inn had procedures in place.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding Xiao Wu's hand, glanced inside. The first floor was a large hall, similar to a mortal inn, with tables and chairs where guests dined and drank.</p><p>Some cultivators enjoyed lively atmospheres.</p><p>From the second floor upwards were private rooms and quiet chambers.</p><p>The Gathering Immortals Inn was built with embedded spirit formations, allowing the private rooms to transform into various sceneries.  If a guest wished to feast amidst celestial clouds, experiencing an otherworldly ambiance, the inn could likely accommodate them.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu’s arrival attracted the attention of some in the hall.  Some glanced at them and looked away, while others observed the unusual pair with interest.</p><p>Even guests in the upper-floor private rooms took notice.</p><p>On the third floor.</p><p>Within a private room, a scene of celestial clouds and a jade pond manifested.</p><p>Exquisite dishes and fine wines were arranged amidst the clouds and mist, each emitting spiritual energy.  Some cups even glowed with a fiery red light, clearly not ordinary items.</p><p>Several burly men feasted and drank with unrestrained abandon.</p><p>A dozen dancers gracefully moved around them, their seductive charm subtly revealed.</p><p>“Second Brother.”</p><p>A lean, shrewd-looking man paused after drinking a cup of wine, nudging his companion with his elbow.</p><p>The man wiped his face, the effects of the alcohol seemingly vanishing. He looked towards the entrance of the Gathering Immortals Inn, gazing for a moment before asking in a low voice, “Are you sure they're new faces?”</p><p>“Absolutely.  The little girl is so refined.  If I’d seen this father-daughter pair before, I would definitely remember.”</p><p>The shrewd man stated confidently.</p><p>…</p><p>“Our business has arrived…”</p><p>A faint smile played on Qin Sang’s lips as he transmitted his voice to Xiao Wu.</p><p>The mere formations of the Gathering Immortals Inn couldn't obstruct his perception.</p><p>Xiao Wu seemed bewildered.</p><p>“No need, we're heading into the fire domain to search for medicinal herbs. We'll rest briefly before leaving the town. Please prepare some high-quality spirit beast meat and blood for my spirit horse,” Qin Sang shook his head, leading Xiao Wu into the Gathering Immortals Inn.</p>
