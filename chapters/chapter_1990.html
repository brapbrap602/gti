<h1>Chapter 1981: The Mortal Realm</h1><p>Opening the Altar!</p><p>Qin Sang, using a bronze pillar as bait, deployed the unfinished Four Symbols Sword Formation to create a sword domain, trapping Old Ancestor Ming Hu.  Finally, the plot was revealed.</p><p>The thunder altar appeared.</p><p>The beam of light that shot towards the sky was like the first ray of light illuminating the mortal realm, shining upon the earth!</p><p>Evening in Yan, already shrouded in a haze, was completely bathed in the thunder light, revealing every detail.</p><p>Yan had relocated its capital to the old capital of Liang.</p><p>In the capital, at the Chancellor's Mansion…</p><p>Yu Lang, draped in a brocade robe, leaned against his armchair, engrossed in a book. A charcoal brazier sat at his feet, the dark red coals radiating warmth that filled the study.</p><p>With his cultivation, he felt no cold even in winter.  Having spent over a decade disguised as a mortal, he had grown accustomed to this life.</p><p>The setting sun cast its golden rays through the window, illuminating the pages of his book.</p><p>Lost in his reading, a sudden, blinding light flashed into the study.  The brilliance was so intense that the words on the book blurred.</p><p>Yu Lang's expression changed. He abruptly stood, gazing out the window.  Outside, everything was a blinding white, impossible to see.</p><p>Chaos erupted in the Chancellor's Mansion, filled with cries of alarm.</p><p>"Yu Lang!"</p><p>A hurried voice reached his ears.</p><p>It was Brother Sha!  Brother Sha rarely disturbed him during his evening reading and contemplation.</p><p>"Brother Sha, what is that light?"</p><p>Yu Lang's mind raced. He instinctively assumed that cultivators were battling outside the city.  The scale of the event suggested at least a Yuan Ying cultivator!</p><p>Omens of upheaval!</p><p>Yan had unified, but everyone understood that peace was temporary.  Friction along the borders was constant.</p><p>Yan and its neighboring countries were all preparing for war, with cultivators fanning the flames.</p><p>True peace would only come with true unification.</p><p>"It seems to originate from Qingyang Temple!"</p><p>A figure materialized beside Yu Lang—Sha Jia Yu.  Bathed in the light, he appeared covered in a layer of frost, unrealistically pale.</p><p>His face was grave as he looked southwest, performing a hand gesture.</p><p>Yu Lang's vision cleared, finally revealing the beam of light, a pillar piercing the heavens.</p><p>Such a terrifying phenomenon was visible even from the capital, miles away. What had happened there? Had a powerful enemy attacked Qingyang Temple?</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but recall the decisive battle years ago, when his master descended from the mountain, defeating numerous demons and thwarting Luo Hun Yuan's scheme.  Had Luo Hun Yuan sought revenge?</p><p>"Stay calm! If Master and Xiao Wu are defeated, going there is suicide. Let's send a message to Yun Xian Shi first," Sha Jia Yu said, seeing Yu Lang's worried expression and fearing his concern might cloud his judgment.</p><p>Yu Lang nodded, immediately sending a talisman, but his resolve remained unshaken.  "Master saved my life.  If the temple is in trouble, I must return, even if I die at Qingyang Temple! Brother Sha is not a disciple of Qingyang Temple, don't get involved. Please send me back and then return to the capital.  If I perish, I ask that you care for my family!"</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang's unwavering determination and willingness to die, Sha Jia Yu sighed, "Let's go back and see. Hopefully, the situation isn't that dire…"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu summoned his flying artifact, took Yu Lang aboard, and flew at full speed.</p><p>Once in the air, the scale of the phenomenon became clear.</p><p>Everywhere, above and below.</p><p>Light illuminated all, a landscape of silver.</p><p>But the phenomenon affected more than just Yan.</p><p>As the thunder light rapidly spread beyond Yan, the subsidiary altars erupted alongside the main altar.</p><p>Sixty-four subsidiary altars, distributed around the main altar in a regular pattern, almost covered the entire mortal realm.</p><p>The locations of these altars varied.</p><p>Time and change had altered their surroundings from their initial construction.</p><p>Some were hidden deep within mountains, rivers, and lakes; others were located in towns and villages; one was even situated inside an ancient well.</p><p>The array activated, and all the altars reappeared in the world!</p><p>Tai Yi felt the tremor beneath his altar, unable to contain his excitement.</p><p>He had long yearned for the Dao Court and was finally witnessing the true power of the Lord and the Dao Court altars!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The altar reacted, unleashing a spectacle of its own.</p><p>A mountain split open, revealing an altar hidden for countless years. Countless lightning-like runes lifted Tai Yi into the sky, instantly transforming into a thunder altar.</p><p>This altar was slightly smaller than the one at Qingyang Temple, echoing the main altar.</p><p>Similar phenomena occurred at the other subsidiary altars.</p><p>Tai Yi stood on the thunder altar, his clothes billowing, gazing towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>He couldn't see Qingyang Temple from his position, but through the array, he could sense the main altar and the other subsidiary altars.</p><p>All the sacrificial altars and their masters, linked together by the altar array, were brewing an incredibly terrifying power.</p><p>Taiyi dared not, and could not, be distracted.</p><p>At this moment, all the masters of the branch altars, casting aside all distracting thoughts, obeyed the will transmitted from the main altar, holding thunder talismans and performing ritual steps.</p><p>The thunder incantation was activated, the altar shook violently, and terrifying thunderbolts burst forth.</p><p>Including the main altar, a total of sixty-five beams of lightning, like giant swords piercing the heavens, seemed to pierce the sky itself.</p><p>The mortal world was undergoing a baptism of lightning.</p><p>After the extreme light, darkness followed immediately.</p><p>The spectacle of the activated altar was earth-shattering.  The world's energy surged, and boundless, rolling dark clouds gathered.</p><p>Before people could recover from the shock of the lightning, they saw the sky shrouded in dark clouds, as if the heavens were about to collapse.</p><p>At this moment, regardless of immortal or mortal, fear welled up uncontrollably in everyone's hearts.</p><p>The entire sky was covered by dark clouds, and the spectacle was far from over.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>A dull roar of thunder echoed from the heavens.</p><p>The thunder grew louder, shaking the very soul.</p><p>From the swirling clouds, bolts of lightning erupted from time to time, revealing horrifying scenes.</p><p>Above the sea of clouds, something mysterious occurred; thunderbolts, like true dragons, flashed briefly before disappearing into the clouds.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon grew increasingly terrifying, surpassing even legendary divine punishments.</p><p>The mortal world was thrown into chaos.</p><p>"Great Heaven, have mercy! Great Heaven, have mercy!"</p><p>Mortals cried out in terror, kneeling and praying.</p><p>The demons, reminded of the tribulation thunder, either prostrated themselves or hid in their caves, trembling.</p><p>Cultivators were filled with fear and trembling.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators were shocked by the terrifying might of Heaven. Some sects immediately activated their protective mountain formations, but they all knew this was merely self-deception.</p><p>If the heavenly thunder struck, it could easily raze the mountain gate to the ground.</p><p>No one knew what was happening.</p><p>On the border of Yan, Master Yun, awakened from meditation, flew out of his cave and, seeing the celestial phenomenon, became uncertain.</p><p>…</p><p>The fluctuations of the altar array even spread to Mount Mulu and Mount Yun.</p><p>Cultivators in both places were alarmed.</p><p>Cultivators whose caves were closer to the mortal world could see the changes in the mortal realm when they flew into the sky.</p><p>Looking down from above, the mortal world was enveloped in dark clouds, and even more terrifying phenomena unfolded above the sea of clouds.</p><p>Almost the instant the sixty-five lightning pillars shot out, endless thunderbolts were born.</p><p>Their origin was unknown.</p><p>Under the heavens, everything was transformed into a sea of thunder!</p><p>Bolt after bolt of lightning, seemingly tearing through the void, danced wildly in the sky.</p><p>The cultivators of Mount Mulu and Mount Yun witnessed this scene, standing dumbfounded, their faces full of horror.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang calmly sipped his spiritual tea, his gaze sweeping over Old Man Guyun, then towards the mortal world.</p><p>As for Old Man Guyun, the moment the altar array was activated, his expression changed drastically, and he abruptly stood up.</p><p>Qin Sang sat calmly, appreciating his masterpiece.</p><p>Although he had anticipated it, seeing the scale of the altar array firsthand still filled him with shock, even more so than Old Man Guyun.</p><p>…</p><p>Unfortunately, Ancestor Minghu remained completely unaware.</p><p>The sword array revealed the aura of a sword domain, causing not only Old Man Guyun to lose his composure, but Ancestor Minghu to be utterly shocked.</p><p>The power of the sword domain was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Previously, under Qin Sang's continuous fierce attacks, Ancestor Minghu was merely angry, not believing his life was in danger.</p><p>At this moment, he truly felt the threat, and the fear!</p><p>A sword cultivator who had comprehended a sword domain…</p><p>Ancestor Minghu's thoughts raced.  Instead of immediately unleashing his life-and-death reversal, he opened his storage pouch, taking out the bronze pillar,</p><p>“I have no intention of monopolizing treasures. Since you also covet the Panlong Heavenly Pillar, there is no need for a fight to the death.  As the saying goes, it is better to resolve grievances than to harbor them. If you stop, let’s forget the past grievances.  As for the reward from the Jitian Sect, my Luohun Abyss will only take four tenths!”</p><p>Previously, he could share the Panlong Ancient Array with Heavenly Yun, and now he could share the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>The opponent's displayed strength was enough to make him concede. Showing weakness wasn't shameful.</p><p>Four tenths, even three tenths, were negotiable.</p><p>After all, they didn't have any deep-seated hatred, and the Jitian Sect’s reward wasn’t a unique treasure.</p><p>For a Nascent Soul cultivator, self-preservation was paramount.</p><p>The opponent's strength was unfathomable, although only at the early Nascent Soul stage; if he fought to the death, the opponent wouldn't be unscathed.</p><p>It would take a Nascent Soul cultivator decades to recover from injuries, inevitably affecting their cultivation.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu didn't believe Qin Sang would drive him to a dead end.</p><p>However, his perception was obscured by the sword array and sword domain. Even the fluctuations of the altar array were masked by the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>This was exactly Qin Sang's intention: a carefully laid trap to corner Old Ancestor Ming Hu!</p><p>The altar array was inscribed with fourth-order spirit talismans, and he only had early Nascent Soul cultivation. Even with the altar's assistance, it would be extremely strenuous.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that if he directly activated the array, the thunder talismans might not launch before Old Ancestor Ming Hu escaped, leaving him empty-handed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had no time to respond to Old Ancestor Ming Hu.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The four Divine Transformation cultivators, leading the various sub-altar masters, exerted all their strength, countless bolts of lightning surging madly towards the heavens.</p><p>The might of the thunder was awe-inspiring.</p><p>This was divine power capable of shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Only thunder existed in the sky; the power was terrifying, enough to destroy everything!</p><p>The power of the thunder became increasingly immense.</p><p>When this power reached its peak, it suddenly converged towards the center of the thunder sea. In an instant, all celestial phenomena vanished, giving birth to an even more brilliant, dazzling ray of thunder.</p><p>Compared to the boundless human world, this ray of thunder was incredibly small, only the size of a human head.</p><p>Inside the thunder ray was a silver sheet of paper.</p><p>This paper was identical to the silver paper inside the main altar, but even more solid, condensing the power of the entire array.</p><p>Dao Court fourth-order thunder talisman:  Sacrifice Thunder Oath!</p><p>The next moment, the paper trembled slightly, fluttering towards the north like a feather.</p><p>The Sacrifice Thunder Oath was incredibly light, seemingly slow yet swift, instantly traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, "drifting" to the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body let out a relieved sigh, but was also slightly unnerved. He waved his hand, putting away the sword array and escaping the sky pit.</p><p>The starlight faded.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu thought he had persuaded the other party and was about to dispel the Life and Death Reverse Wheel, when suddenly, an extremely terrifying fluctuation descended.</p><p>At this moment, Old Ancestor Ming Hu felt a chill down his spine, gazing up at the sky in terror.</p><p>The sky was normal, except for a lightly fluttering silver paper.</p><p>This silver paper descended from the heavens.</p><p>In Old Ancestor Ming Hu's eyes, everything around him disappeared, leaving only this sheet of paper.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to freeze; he didn't notice the terror on his face.</p><p>There was no sound between heaven and earth.  The silver paper felt like a thousand pounds, bringing extreme oppression.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu howled towards the sky, his voice as shrill as a ghost, laced with fear.</p><p>The black and white wheel above his head spun rapidly, instantly reversing life and death, suddenly erupting!</p><p>The entire sky pit seemed to be stripped of color, leaving only black and white auras.</p><p>A huge Life and Death Reverse Wheel trapped the Sacrifice Thunder Oath in its center. The vortex of black and white light pressed inwards fiercely, attempting to tear the thin silver paper apart!</p><p>The Sacrifice Thunder Oath remained unwavering, steadily descending, pressing down!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>In Old Ancestor Ming Hu's terrified eyes, a crack appeared in the Life and Death Reverse Wheel.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu roared, a desperate cry.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Flesh and blood exploded.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu turned into a dark gold skeleton, emitting a strange glow.</p><p>Nascent Soul corpse cultivators are known as Unfading Bones, their bones refined to an extremely hard state.</p><p>Even a single bone could regenerate.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu, instead of retreating, pressed forward, his whole body shining with dark light, charging towards the Life and Death Reverse Wheel.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Life and Death Reverse Wheel shattered completely, chaotic black and white auras filling the entire sky pit.</p><p>At the center of the black and white aura, incredibly dazzling thunder light shone, forming a terrifying lightning storm that swept across the land, overpowering the black and white aura.</p><p>Simultaneously, a sword beam slashed down from above.</p><p>A Mahayana cultivator wielding a fourth-order spirit talisman could undoubtedly easily kill Old Ancestor Ming Hu.</p><p>But this Sacrifice Thunder Oath was cast by him through the altar, its power intimately related to the altar and the cultivators' cultivation.  This being the first time Qin Sang used it, he couldn't guarantee success.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang followed up with a sword strike.</p><p>The Huiying Sword cut into the thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed Old Ancestor Ming Hu's struggling aura within the thunder, controlling the Huiying Sword to press forward.</p><p>...</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's hands and feet were icy; he could no longer remain calm.</p><p>If that silver paper had drifted here, falling onto his Dharma body, could he have survived?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou had no confidence, unless he could sense the danger beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang had given him too many shocks, the most shocking being the sword domain and the altar he finally revealed.</p><p>He turned, looking at the calmly composed Qin Sang.  Forcing himself to remain calm, he said with difficulty,</p><p>"Was this play, Daoist, for Old Man to watch?"</p><p>Qin Sang's performance didn't seem like he was vying for the Panlong Heavenly Pillar; it was clearly aimed at killing the old zombie.</p><p>The Panlong Heavenly Pillar was more like a trap.</p><p>Did they have a past grievance, or was there some other reason?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou felt that things weren't that simple, but he couldn't figure out Qin Sang's true intentions.</p><p>*Clap!*</p><p>Qin Sang placed a piece at the Tian Yuan point.</p><p>"Mortal realm, immortals and demons may not enter!"</p>
