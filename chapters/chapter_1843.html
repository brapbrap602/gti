<h1>Chapter 1834  Too Late</h1><p>The entrance to the Qiaoyan.</p><p>Toxic mist swirled around Qin Sang.  The cave interior was deep and dark, its bottom unseen.</p><p>‘Swish swish swish…’</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out and landed at the cave's edge. Eight spirit flags formed a Bagua array, encircling the entrance.</p><p>The spirit flag array was a precaution.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated here for decades, always wary of the Qiaoyan, but had detected no abnormalities. There was no sign of living creatures.</p><p>Having set up the array, Qin Sang flicked out an iron ball, which transformed into a black dog upon landing.</p><p>The black dog seemed to sense the danger within.  Like a living creature, it crouched, its eyes fixed on the entrance, whimpering softly.</p><p>The black dog was actually a puppet, specially crafted with Mo Xingdao's help for reconnaissance. It contained a poison-based restriction, partially integrated with the Detoxifying Radiance.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang activated the poison pearl, shooting a Detoxifying Radiance into the black dog.  At his command, the dog leaped into the cave.</p><p>He waited a moment, then followed calmly.</p><p>The moment he entered, a wave of icy coldness washed over him. The rustling of the toxic mist echoed from the depths of the Qiaoyan, like the whimpering of ghosts, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded through the mist, his mind linked to the large array in the Flower Field space, sensing the restrictions in this place, attempting to discern the cause of the Qiaoyan's changes from the array's fluctuations.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang paused slightly, his brow furrowing.  He moved forward quickly, seeing the first black dog frozen in place by the roadside.</p><p>The dog's face was unrecognizable. Its originally black and shiny body was now covered in rust, immobile, its flesh continuously corroded by the intense poison.</p><p>Within moments, the dog was almost unrecognizable, reduced to scrap metal.  Its body surface began to melt, soon to become a pool of poisonous liquid.</p><p>“The toxicity is truly fierce…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. According to the array's calculations, he was still more than ninety percent of the distance from the Qiaoyan's center. Fortunately, he had brought enough puppets.</p><p>He summoned another black dog, continuing the exploration. This process was repeated several times.</p><p>The deeper he went, the shorter the puppets lasted.  However, Qin Sang didn't feel strained, utilizing his poison energy in conjunction with the Detoxifying Light Armor.</p><p>Moreover, the anticipated danger hadn't appeared. As he neared the Qiaoyan's center, the toxic mist remained calm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he had this thought, his connection with the puppet ahead suddenly broke.</p><p>Simultaneously, a gust of cold wind swept from the front.</p><p>In the final moments, Qin Sang, through the puppet, saw a shadow. The puppet was instantly killed. The shadow had a humanoid shape, almost certainly a living creature!</p><p>His eyes narrowed. He forcefully activated the poison pearl within him, the Detoxifying Radiance flashing repeatedly, condensing into a nearly tangible seven-colored treasure armor on his body.</p><p>The armor was heavy, its light illuminating the surging toxic mist ahead. Within the mist, a ghostly figure appeared.</p><p>The icy wind hit him, followed by the shrill cry of a sword.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword pierced through the mist.</p><p>The cave was not very wide, barely able to accommodate three people walking side-by-side. Now, sword energy ran rampant, seemingly about to pierce the cave walls.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword shadow flashed and disappeared. The surrounding light seemed to grow even darker.  Qin Sang had unleashed the Seven Mansions Dividing Sword Array.</p><p>The sword array sealed the cave, instantly encasing the shadow, which was exposed in the focused starlight, revealing its true form.</p><p>The sword array was mysterious. The shadow couldn't break through, only able to wander within the 'starry sky.'</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the monster within the array, his expression unusual.</p><p>The shadow looked like a living thing, capable of movement, instinctively attacking enemies, yet it didn't seem to possess intelligence.</p><p>However, the shadow reminded Qin Sang of the Flower Fairy he had encountered years ago; there were similarities.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang recalled something else. With a slight movement of his thoughts, the sword stars converged, transforming into a White Tiger's ferocious strike.</p><p>The shadow roared upward at the White Tiger's attack, its body swelling with thick toxic mist, but it was no match for the White Tiger's might.  The toxic mist and the shadow's form were shattered at the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang made a feint, capturing a wisp of black energy in his palm.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>From the black energy, Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura, the strange energy that had once poisoned the disciples of the Lougu Mountain.</p><p>His previous guess that the strange energy originated from the Qiaoyan was correct.</p><p>Using his poison energy to sense it briefly, he realized the black energy's toxicity was extremely strong.  The strange energy within that Lougu Mountain disciple was different from the black energy; she likely only had superficial contact. Otherwise, she wouldn't have lived to see him.</p><p>“The shadow is similar to a living creature.  Was that Flower Fairy not a transformed flower spirit, but a transformed shadow? How many Flower Fairies has the Qiaoyan nurtured?”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat puzzled. His observations in the Qiaoyan didn't match the records in the *Poison God Classic*.</p><p>He guessed that perhaps the master of the Flower Field had made private alterations, or maybe the Qiaoyan had undergone spontaneous changes due to years of having no master.</p><p>Knowing the shadows existed, Qin Sang proceeded with caution. If there weren't many flower spirits, he could kill them and take their orbs. But if the cavity was packed with them, he'd retreat.</p><p>Sealing the dark energy, Qin Sang ventured deeper, soon encountering a second shadow. He used his sword array again to eliminate it and successfully reached the core of the cavity.</p><p>The cave ended in a pitch-black space, with a faint, flickering light at its center.</p><p>In this dim light, he saw strange shadows drifting in the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched at the sight. He suppressed his aura with all his might to avoid an attack.</p><p>These shadows were the same kind he had already slain—dull-witted, seemingly bound by a strange force, unwilling to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye ability.  His gaze pierced through the shadows, revealing the source of the light, causing him to pause in surprise.</p><p>The source was a fruit, plum-sized, translucent like a grape, with skin so delicate it seemed to hold a burst of sweet juice.</p><p>The fruit was incredibly alluring.</p><p>Indeed, Qin Sang's eyes grew hot. Having cultivated poison arts for many years, he was intimately familiar with flower dew, and this fruit's aura was very similar!</p><p>After a careful examination, Qin Sang formed a theory. He silently retreated, produced a strand of dark energy, and carefully studied it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang understood. He returned to the cavity's core to sense it again, nodded silently, and felt eight-tenths certain.</p><p>The dark energy was the essence of the shadows' existence. At its core, it emanated a subtle energy similar to the orbs within the flower spirits.</p><p>This suggested that the flower spirits evolved from the shadows, but their transformation had been forcibly interrupted by some power before reaching completion, leaving them in their current peculiar state.</p><p>That power originated from an array within the cavity.</p><p>Upon understanding the array's function, Qin Sang marveled at its ingenuity.</p><p>It was cleverly embedded within the core of the flower field array, the energies of both arrays perfectly merging, almost indistinguishable.  Only those familiar with the "Poison God Canon" could discern the difference.</p><p>Excess flower dew accumulated here, transformed by the array into the fruit.</p><p>The fruit was essentially a poison fruit nurtured by flower dew, preserved in this form to prevent waste and avoid the creation of overwhelmingly powerful flower spirits that would seize control of the flower field if left unattended for too long.</p><p>The transformation wasn't perfect. The excess, following the original array's pattern, dissipated outwards, its toxicity altered, blending into the external poison restrictions, preventing the birth of more flower spirits.</p><p>Another part became these shadows, their evolution halted at a certain point, bound within the cavity, eternally trapped.</p><p>More importantly, the dark energy within the shadows didn't fuse completely with resentment energy like the orbs of flower spirits, making it inseparable.</p><p>Cultivators could separate the resentment energy, though it took effort.  The cultivation speed was faster than without using poison energy.</p><p>Of course, for Qin Sang, the presence or absence of resentment energy made no difference.</p><p>The array also had its limits. It wasn't flawless.</p><p>Too many shadows accumulating in the cavity would eventually lead to the array's collapse, freeing the shadows.</p><p>Those flower spirits would be the lucky ones who escaped. Without Qin Sang and the others, once the flower spirits matured, overcoming their innate fear and the array’s repulsion, breaking the array, consuming their kin and the poison fruit—they would become terrifying demons!</p><p>Now, Qin Sang would reap the benefits.</p><p>Besides his surprise, Qin Sang was also astonished. While he had some expertise in array restrictions, he knew he couldn't create an array like this.</p><p>The creator was no ordinary person!</p><p>This showed that the "Poison God Canon" lineage had once produced exceptionally talented descendants who improved their ancestors' methods.</p><p>Yet, for unknown reasons, this person disappeared from the cultivation world, with no relevant records found.</p><p>"Perhaps, the Daoist Court has records..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, sitting cross-legged in the cave, watching the shadows drift.  Whenever a lone shadow approached, he trapped it with his sword array and silently killed it.</p><p>Strand after strand of dark energy fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>After collecting some, Qin Sang stopped, stood up, took a long look at the alluring poison fruit, then retreated.</p><p>The fruit couldn’t be taken lightly. It had to be harvested after all the shadows were eliminated, otherwise it would enrage them, causing them to break free during the array's instability, turning the flower field space into a chaotic battleground.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly returned to his cave and used the dark energy to cultivate. The poison energy in the dark energy wasn't as potent as in the flower spirit orbs, but it was better than flower dew. For a while, he didn't have to worry about flower dew shortages.</p><p>Whenever he had free time, Qin Sang would enter the cavity to clear out the shadows. After several trips, he had eliminated them all, leaving only the poison fruit.</p><p>A faint fragrance filled the air.</p><p>The poisonous fruit had no roots or stem, appearing to float in mid-air, seemingly born of nothing.  In reality, its essence was linked to the formation, rooted within it.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang extended his right hand, his palm enveloped in detoxifying light.  He was about to touch the fruit when he abruptly withdrew his hand, frowning as he gazed at it.</p><p>He sensed the fruit and the formation's energy were one.  Rashly taking the fruit might damage the formation's core, destabilizing the entire array.</p><p>Over this period, Qin Sang had mastered the array and learned to repair it, but the fusion of the two formations was incredibly intricate.  Repairing any damage would be extremely difficult.</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang's expression shifted. He formed his fingers into a blade, gently nicking the fruit's skin. A drop of viscous liquid immediately oozed out, falling into a jade vial Qin Sang had prepared.</p><p>The fruit's glow dimmed slightly, causing the formation to fluctuate, but the disturbance quickly subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the vial, a smile spreading across his face.  He only needed a small amount of the liquid.  Since no one else could access the flower field, leaving the fruit there was fine.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling with the vial, Qin Sang attempted to refine the liquid.  His eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>The fruit's essence was of the same origin as the flower dew, yet purer and more potent.  Refining it would likely accelerate his cultivation even further!</p><p>…</p><p>Eight years passed swiftly.</p><p>"The appointed day is approaching…"</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, remembering his agreement with Master Qi to forge the armor soon.</p><p>Master Qi had poured his heart and soul into the precious fragment for decades.  This time, the chances of success were high, yet Qin Sang felt no excitement at the prospect of obtaining the treasure.  Instead, he sighed softly.</p><p>After a brief preparation, Qin Sang left his cultivation chamber, moving stealthily and silently.</p><p>In the eight years, he had only returned once, bringing back a beast carcass. He wondered about the state of the cultivation world.</p><p>His journey was uneventful, and he arrived at the island, finding Master Qi in the forge.</p><p>"Friend, you've finally arrived!"</p><p>Master Qi looked somewhat tense, but relaxed upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>"I will control the fire, Master, you can focus on your work!" Qin Sang reassured him.</p><p>Master Qi suddenly laughed.  "I have nothing to fear! Even if the furnace explodes, will you go to the underworld to demand compensation?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was a joke and chuckled, shaking his head.</p><p>The laughter eased Master Qi's tension.  He gestured for Qin Sang to seal the forge and engaged in final discussions.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>The mansion doors remained closed, Master Qi's disciples gathered anxiously before the forge.</p><p>Inside, the furnace was activated.  Qin Sang controlled the fire, which was unusually docile under his gaze.</p><p>With Qin Sang watching, Master Qi invoked the precious fragment, suspending it above the furnace.  His fingers moved like wheels, striking incantations, integrating them into the fragment’s ripples.</p><p>This refinement differed from previous attempts.  Master Qi poured his life's knowledge into refining the fragment, relentlessly working for several days.</p><p>The fragment appeared unchanged, but the power of the incantations on its surface had likely been layered thousands of times!</p><p>Master Qi couldn't have persevered alone; Qin Sang's assistance was crucial.</p><p>With their combined efforts, the fragment’s watery color darkened noticeably.  Upon the final incantation, ripples surged from the furnace, the watery essence filling the forge.</p><p>"Quickly!"</p><p>Master Qi entrusted the fragment entirely to Qin Sang, immediately beginning the forging of the armor body with other materials.</p><p>…</p><p>A few weeks later.</p><p>The anxiously waiting disciples suddenly felt the ground tremble. A force of intense heat and cold erupted from the forge.  Weaker cultivators paled and retreated.</p><p>Everyone stared nervously at the forge door.</p><p>Inside, the flames subsided, revealing two weary figures.</p><p>Master Qi held a suit of armor, his face brimming with uncontainable excitement.</p><p>The armor was only palm-sized, lacking plates; the entire piece resembled cast water.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice rang out, "This armor is your creation, Master. Please name it."</p><p>Gratitude flashed in Master Qi’s eyes.  He hesitated, as if recalling past events, a faint smile appearing on his face. "In my youth, I lived beneath Mount Ming. Let this armor be called the Ming Shan Armor, what do you think?"</p><p>"Ming Shan Armor, a fine name!" Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Master Qi examined it for a long time, reluctant to part with it.  He finally handed it to Qin Sang, watching him refine it.  He then looked up at the sky, his expression unreadable, his tone ethereal: "Friend, do you believe the art of crafting can lead to immortality?"</p><p>He had devoted himself to crafting, neglecting his own cultivation.</p><p>Was it due to his dull aptitude, his inability to grasp the true meaning, or was it truly impossible to excel in both?</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and said solemnly, "There are three thousand ways to the Dao.  The art of crafting is among them, how can it lag behind?"</p><p>Master Qi lowered his head, sighing softly, "Meeting you… was too late…"</p><p>He sighed deeply again, "Too late!"</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Northern Star Island Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang and his disciples witnessed Master Qi's tribulation.  He perished under the heavenly thunder.</p><p>In the final moment, Qin Sang seemed to see a shadowy figure in the tribulation clouds, offering a farewell gesture.</p>
