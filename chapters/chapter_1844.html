<h1>Chapter 1835: An Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>The thunderclouds dispersed, the person was gone.</p><p>Beneath the heavenly tribulation lay a wasteland.</p><p>Master Qi's disciples flew to the site of the tribulation, kneeling and weeping bitterly. Qin Sang also sighed deeply.</p><p>After paying their respects, Qin Sang took out a token and handed it to Master Qi's eldest disciple. "If you encounter difficulties in the future, present this token and seek help from Sword Heart Island. If your adversary is too powerful, remember to endure for the time being, and this poor Daoist will personally seek justice for you."</p><p>Before facing the tribulation, Master Qi had asked Qin Sang to look after his descendants, and Qin Sang had agreed.</p><p>For ordinary disputes, the Sword Slave's intervention would suffice.</p><p>If Master Qi's descendants somehow incurred significant karmic debt, the Sword Saint shouldn't be involved. Qin Sang would personally resolve the matter upon his return.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for your kindness."</p><p>The disciples knelt and kowtowed in gratitude.</p><p>"Master Qi's reputation is illustrious. You, who inherit his mantle, must be diligent and disciplined, and conduct yourselves well."</p><p>Qin Sang drifted away, his voice fading into the distance.</p><p>Returning to Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang entrusted this matter to the Sword Slave and entered his cave dwelling, summoning the Bright Mountain Armor for a careful examination.</p><p>This treasured armor embodied Master Qi's lifelong dedication.</p><p>The armor didn't possess any special abilities, instead pursuing the ultimate in defense. Its strength lay in the fragments of a True Treasure fused within its structure.</p><p>The armor was seamlessly integrated, allowing every part of the body to benefit from the True Treasure fragments. Although the fused power couldn't compare to the original fragments themselves, it was still exceptionally robust.</p><p>Most importantly, as long as Qin Sang willed it, he could re-condense the True Treasure fragments at any point on the armor to protect vital areas.</p><p>The armor's reputation was well-deserved!</p><p>…</p><p>The Demonic Wastes.</p><p>Two figures, one tall and one short, sped through the mountains.</p><p>The taller one wore a suit of purple armor, matching his purple hair. Even his eyes were purple, radiating a demonic violet light.</p><p>The other person was only as tall as the purple-armored man's waist, his back slightly hunched, making him appear even more frail. A long, scorpion-like tail trailed behind him, its stinger gleaming with a cold light.</p><p>From their appearance, this person seemed like a subordinate to the purple-armored man, but in reality, the purple-armored man always stayed half a step behind him.</p><p>As they flew, the shorter man looked left and right, as if searching for something.</p><p>The purple-armored man, on the other hand, kept his gaze fixed, his purple eyes exceptionally sharp, the violet light growing increasingly intense.</p><p>Through the violet light, one could faintly see the purple pupils of the armored man, seemingly containing a world within.</p><p>Inside, there were shadows of mountains and rivers, the vegetation appearing incredibly real.</p><p>A closer look revealed that the mountain at the center of his pupils was the very mountain range they were currently flying over. The world within his pupils was a reflection of the real world.</p><p>Clearly, the purple-armored man was employing some sort of divine ability, encompassing the surrounding world within his pupils, every detail meticulously reproduced.</p><p>With the aid of this peculiar eye technique, nothing in the surroundings could escape the purple-armored man's gaze, not even the slightest fluctuation of Qi.</p><p>The shorter man also occasionally employed detection techniques, but his primary duty was vigilance, constantly guarding against dangers lurking in the shadows.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you've been searching with your Purple Heaven Pupils for so long with no reaction. It seems it's not in our direction. This great merit is not meant for us…"</p><p>The shorter man's expression gradually relaxed, smacking his lips, his tone tinged with disappointment.</p><p>The purple-armored man remained silent, unfazed by the shorter man's words, continuing his diligent search.</p><p>The shorter man was well aware of the purple-armored man's temperament, and took no offense, continuing to mutter to himself.</p><p>As he spoke, the purple-armored man suddenly stopped, a glint of light flashing in his eyes as he abruptly fixed his gaze on the northern mountains.</p><p>Seeing his actions, the shorter man instantly understood, his face hardening. He shouted sharply, "Who's there! Get out!"</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>North of the two demons, within a mountain cave, Qin Sang sat in meditation, his brow furrowed.</p><p>After settling Master Qi's affairs, Qin Sang had returned from Ju Mountain Prefecture. The route he chose leaned towards the Dao Court's territory, considered relatively safe.</p><p>While in Ju Mountain Prefecture, he had briefly inquired about the situation, learning that in recent years, the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had engaged in constant friction, albeit through minor actions.</p><p>For example, a few years ago, the Dao Court launched a swift and decisive strike, sweeping clean the demonic temples around Zhongmao and Baishi Prefectures. The demonic gods in the northern part of Ju Mountain Prefecture were all in a state of panic, abandoning their followers and temples, fleeing back to the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>However, the Dao Court didn't press their advantage, seemingly content with issuing a warning. They quickly withdrew their troops and didn't deploy any garrisons.</p><p>Nevertheless, after this lesson, the Demonic Wastes, once dominated by demonic gods, developed distinct boundaries. Even if demonic gods dared to cross the line and infiltrate, they no longer acted as brazenly as before.</p><p>The route Qin Sang chose was on the western side of the boundary. He hadn't encountered any danger along the way, but as he neared the prefectural altar of Ju Mountain Prefecture, he sensed something amiss.</p><p>Then, the Skyeye Butterfly detected two powerful demonic auras approaching from afar. Uncertain of their intentions, Qin Sang didn't act rashly, choosing to conceal himself on the spot.</p><p>After the shout.</p><p>The two demonic auras rapidly approached. Qin Sang abandoned any remaining hope; his location had been exposed!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>The reason for his exposure wasn't important. Demonic cultivators often possessed strange and unpredictable divine abilities.</p><p>His concern and confusion stemmed from the unknown changes in the Demonic Wastes. Why would two Demon Marquises dare to cross the border so openly and act so recklessly?</p><p>The Snake Demon and the Direwolf hadn't sent any warnings.</p><p>During the first half of his journey, Qin Sang hadn't detected any signs of trouble. This was likely a sudden incident!</p><p>As the opponents drew closer, Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He made a decisive move, thunder crackling behind his back as he summoned the Phoenix Wings.</p><p>The Phoenix Wings pressed against his back, their azure radiance illuminating the cave.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang deliberately pushed open the stone door and stepped out, looking up at the two streaks of light shooting towards him.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>A surprised sound came from the streaks of light. The two demons landed on the mountaintops flanking Qin Sang, encircling him.</p><p>One was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, the other, the purple-armored one, was at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the cold glint in his eyes, his face displaying a perfectly measured look of confusion. He cupped his hands and asked, "Are the two Fellow Daoists calling for this humble one?"</p><p>The two demons sized up Qin Sang, their gazes lingering on the Phoenix Wings on his back before exchanging a glance.</p><p>This fellow's demonic Qi was pure, and the Phoenix Wings couldn't be fake, but that only proved he was a demonic cultivator.</p><p>There were quite a few demonic cultivators who served the Dao Court, willingly driven by Daoist priests. They were all enemies of the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>The shorter man questioned in a deep voice, "What is your origin? Why are you here?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately flicked his sleeves and snorted coldly, "The two Fellow Daoists forced this humble one out of his cave dwelling without any reason. Shouldn't you introduce yourselves first?"</p><p>The shorter man's eyes flashed with a cold light, but Qin Sang met his gaze without fear.</p><p>After a moment, the shorter man raised his right hand, conjuring an object. "We are serving under King Ling Yue. We have important matters at hand and need you to answer a few questions. If there are no anomalies, we naturally won't make things difficult for you."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately put on an ingratiating expression. "So you are envoys of the kingdom. This humble one is the Grand Preceptor of the Azure Kite Kingdom. I was blind just now. I hope the envoys won't take offense."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang pulled out a large seal from his sleeve and flashed it at the two demons.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor seal and his identity were naturally fabricated.</p><p>Qin Sang had traveled between the prefectural altar and Ju Mountain Prefecture many times, and knew that walking the night road often led to encounters with ghosts. He had ordered the Snake Demon to pave the way with wealth, gathering information about the internal affairs of the Ghost Fang Kingdom. After gaining a general understanding of the various Demon Kings' power and grudges, he had prepared various strategies.</p><p>This King Ling Yue, whose territory was located in the extreme north of Gang Mountain Prefecture, on the northern border of the Ghost Fang Kingdom, was known for his low profile. The Demon Marquises under his command weren't renowned because they were all reclusive individuals, rarely making public appearances.</p><p>Qin Sang's fabricated identity was perfect for dealing with them.</p><p>This kind of disguise couldn't guarantee complete success, but as long as it could reduce the opponent's hostility, Qin Sang had a chance to escape.</p><p>The shorter man kept scrutinizing Qin Sang, somewhat surprised that this fellow, with decent cultivation, would willingly waste his time in the demonic kingdom.</p><p>However, such things weren't unheard of. Some old timers didn't want to get involved in disputes, preferring to hide in the demonic kingdom and live as carefree lords.</p><p>"I ask you, what are you doing here?" The shorter man's gaze was sharp and probing.</p><p>"This humble one often ventures deep into the Demonic Wastes to hunt ferocious beasts. Not long ago, I pursued a beast and unknowingly chased it too far, losing my target. I was about to return to the capital. If I have offended the two of you, this humble one will take his leave…"</p><p>Qin Sang fabricated a story.</p><p>The two demons' expressions softened slightly, but their vigilance remained.</p><p>The shorter man looked at the purple-armored man, whose eyes shone brightly. After a moment, he shook his head slightly.</p><p>After pondering for a bit, the shorter man said, "In that case, this matter has nothing to do with you. However, we need to report this to our superiors. Come with us. Meet with Fellow Daoist Fu, verify your identity, and we'll let you go."</p><p>"May I ask who this Fellow Daoist Fu is?" Qin Sang frowned deeply, his face full of caution.</p><p>"Do you not know who the most powerful expert under King Ling Yue is? With Fellow Daoist Fu's status, and carrying the King's decree, he wouldn't kill innocents indiscriminately. Relax," the shorter man scoffed at Qin Sang's timidity.</p><p>"So it's the renowned Marquis Fu. Of course, this humble one trusts him."</p><p>Qin Sang seemed relieved, his expression returning to normal as he flew into the air.</p><p>The two demons also summoned their escape lights, flying ahead, letting Qin Sang follow behind.</p><p>For a time, they seemed to become acquainted, the tense atmosphere dissipating.</p><p>"I wonder how much further it is until we meet Marquis Fu?"</p><p>Qin Sang followed for a while, noticing that the two demons were still aimlessly searching for something, showing no signs of leaving. He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The shorter man didn't turn his head. "Don't worry. Fellow Daoist Fu is to the south. We'll take you there after searching the vicinity."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. Along the way, he subtly tried to extract information, but unfortunately, the two demons were tight-lipped. Even now, he still didn't know what had happened.</p><p>However, after several inquiries, he had gleaned some information.</p><p>For instance, there were more than three Demon Marquises in the vicinity. Almost all the experts under King Ling Yue had been mobilized, spreading out over a large area, searching for something.</p><p>The Demon Marquises were all here, so where was King Ling Yue?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt a chill. He had to escape quickly and absolutely couldn't be taken to see Marquis Fu!</p><p>His fake identity could only deceive them temporarily and wouldn't withstand close scrutiny. If he were taken before the Demon King, there would be nowhere to hide.</p><p>But the two demons were relentless, and shaking them off wouldn't be easy.</p><p>A murderous intent flashed in Qin Sang's eyes as he calculated in his mind, his tone remaining casual. "I wonder what the two Fellow Daoists are searching for. This humble one is unskilled, but I have a few divine abilities that might be of assistance."</p><p>Hearing this, the purple-armored man seemed slightly moved. He was constantly using his Purple Heaven Pupils, which consumed a lot of energy. Having someone share the burden and take turns searching would be much easier.</p><p>Unfortunately, although the opponent's aura was completely different from their target, his identity was still unknown and untrustworthy.</p><p>The purple-armored man opened his mouth, about to say something, when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Without any warning, an extremely terrifying aura erupted from behind, an aura containing heavenly pressure even more dreadful than what he had felt when facing Marquis Fu!</p><p>As the heavenly pressure descended, the two demons were shaken to their cores.</p><p>They hadn't completely trusted Qin Sang and had remained on guard, but they never expected this person to possess such terrifying pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang had merged with his Dharma Idol early on. Now, he erupted with power, a force that would even intimidate a late Nascent Soul cultivator like Xia Hou, let alone the two demons before him.</p><p>As the heavenly pressure enveloped the two demons, a gust of icy wind surged from Qin Sang's sleeves, and his body, almost merging with the icy wind, charged forward.</p><p>The icy wind rushed straight towards the purple-armored man.</p><p>Although the two demons had maintained a distance from Qin Sang, that distance was practically negligible.</p><p>Four Iceflood Pythons, baring their fangs and claws, instantly surrounded the purple-armored man, spewing icy flames. The terrifying chill seemed to freeze the void itself, and raging black flames rose up.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang brushed past the purple-armored man, charging towards the shorter man with astonishing speed.</p><p>He then saw a black sphere bulge from the shorter man's hunched back. The sphere exploded, transforming into a grey curtain barrier that enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>A flash of lightning streaked past Qin Sang's eyes as the scorpion tail approached in an instant, its stinger radiating a dangerous cold light.</p><p>They had dared to bring Qin Sang along, so they couldn't have been completely unprepared. They just hadn't anticipated Qin Sang's sudden attack, and its ferocity.</p><p>Facing the scorpion tail inches from his face, Qin Sang didn't even glance at it. His Dharma Idol and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal's power surged, his body clad in the Bright Mountain Armor, utilizing every defensive measure without reservation.</p><p>With a 'bang,' the stinger pierced into the side of Qin Sang's neck, but it couldn't even penetrate the armor, the scorpion tail bouncing off.</p><p>Qin Sang's body only swayed slightly, his forward momentum undiminished. Blood thorns appeared in his palm as he struck the encroaching grey curtain.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A large hole was instantly torn through the grey curtain.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to break through.</p><p>At this moment, the shorter man was terrified. His two powerful techniques not only failed to harm Qin Sang, but they couldn't even delay him for a moment.</p><p>In his panic, the shorter man hurriedly tried to shatter the jade bracelet on his right wrist.</p><p>But as the thought arose, crisscrossing sword light descended from the sky above, overwhelming his mind with boundless killing intent.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly, his forward momentum increasing threefold. He reached out, grabbed the scorpion tail, and yanked it back, unleashing his Blood Qi Seal without reservation.</p><p>He had noticed the jade bracelet flashing earlier and had been paying attention to it.  When it flashed, the shorter man's escape speed would slow down.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it was a communication device and had planned accordingly, preventing the demon from shattering the bracelet.</p><p>From Qin Sang's sudden attack to now, it had only been an instant.</p><p>The two demons never imagined that they, two against one, would be suppressed and rendered completely helpless.</p><p>By the time the shorter man realized the danger, it was too late to shatter the jade bracelet and send a warning!</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>Qin Sang's palm struck the back of the shorter man's neck.</p><p>The Blood Thorns pierced a bloody hole in his body.</p><p>This palm also contained the full force of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. The shorter man instantly spat blood, his spine shattering.</p><p>Almost at the same moment, the killing sword descended, striking the demon squarely on the top of his head, killing him instantly!</p><p>Qin Sang's hand moved like lightning, snatching the vibrating jade bracelet. He was about to seal it when his expression suddenly changed, staring intently at the shorter man's corpse.</p><p>As the demon's Qi vanished, a strange fluctuation emanated, dissipating into the void.</p>
