<h1>Chapter 881: Yin-Yang, Canglan, and Douniu</h1><p>“I do have some faith in Fellow Daoist Qi. Even Senior Brother Fang highly praises him, saying that Fellow Daoist Qi is one of the most promising cultivators on Wandou Island to achieve Nascent Soul…”</p><p>Elder Huayang glanced over the new disciples, then looked at the Chen surname cultivator and coughed lightly. “Since Fellow Daoist Qi isn't here, I can only discuss this matter with you, Junior Brother.”</p><p>“Did Senior Lu give any instructions before his departure?”</p><p>Cultivator Chen asked solemnly.</p><p>The Senior Lu he mentioned was Lu Xiaoyun, the current Sect Leader of the Wandou Sect. After the demonic disturbance in the Demonic Sea, he went to garrison Grand Wilderness Island and hadn't returned yet.</p><p>Even with his rebellious nature, Cultivator Chen wouldn't dare disobey Lu Xiaoyun's direct orders.</p><p>“The Sect Leader hasn't explicitly stated it, but he has tacitly approved,” Elder Huayang said. “Junior Brother should also know that our Yin-Yang Branch has always been less prosperous than the Five Elements Branch. In recent years, it has declined further.  The disciples we've recruited this time around are still not ideal, far inferior to the Five Elements Branch. Therefore, we have to resort to this strategy, widely recruiting disciples to supplement our numbers. Having said that, disciples with excellent aptitude, suitable for cultivating the true inheritance of our Yin-Yang Branch, are not easy to find, especially since we just took a batch at the beginning of the year. I happened to hear that the Smokewater Pavilion was accepting disciples today, so I thought I'd try my luck…”</p><p>The people in the hall reacted with various expressions upon hearing the old Daoist's words.</p><p>The new disciples were all stunned, thinking they had misheard. Did they actually have a chance to join the Wandou Sect, the number one sect on Wandou Island?</p><p>Holding the Smokewater Pavilion tokens in their hands, they had been overjoyed just moments ago, but now they began to fantasize.</p><p>Even Zhao Songqiao, who had been weeping earlier, was slightly shaken, his fingers tightly gripping the token, knuckles white.</p><p>At the same time, they gained a new understanding of the Wandou Sect's domineering nature, daring to barge into another sect to snatch disciples.</p><p>The Incarnation was also secretly surprised.</p><p>He had indeed heard before that the Wandou Sect was roughly divided into the Five Elements Branch and the Yin-Yang Branch.</p><p>Two of the three Grand Inheritances, the *Water Breathing Technique* and the *Wood Bending Scripture*, were cultivation methods of the Five Elements Branch, along with other slightly weaker Five Elements cultivation methods. Therefore, this branch had numerous disciples and was the most prosperous.</p><p>The current Sect Leader, Lu Xiaoyun, hailed from the Five Elements Branch.</p><p>In contrast, the Yin-Yang Branch seemed much more decadent, its name somewhat undeserved.</p><p>It was said that the requirements for its Grand Inheritance cultivation method were too high, not only were suitable disciples difficult to select, but the cultivation itself was also more challenging than other Grand Inheritances.</p><p>Now it seemed the rumors were not unfounded. The Yin-Yang Branch was declining, even resorting to poaching disciples from the Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>The *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Art* was not without its merits, otherwise, it wouldn't be ranked among the three Grand Inheritances, but it couldn't do anything about this situation.</p><p>The Incarnation realized that this was a golden opportunity. That Chen surname cultivator clearly had an issue with him. Staying here would only lead to restrictions and perhaps even expulsion.</p><p>This was a sudden turn of events. If he seized this opportunity, he wouldn't need to resort to roundabout methods and could directly become a Wandou Sect disciple.</p><p>He just didn't know what the Yin-Yang Branch's requirements for disciples were, and whether he could meet them.</p><p>The Incarnation fell into deep thought, his gaze flickering.</p><p>In the hall, only one person grew angrier as he listened.</p><p>Cultivator Chen's face grew darker and darker, like the bottom of a pot.</p><p>Elder Huayang seemed oblivious, continuing to speak incessantly. “I brought the Yin-Yang Disc with me this time. Whether it works or not, we'll know with one try. It won't delay your pavilion's official business, so please accommodate me, Junior Brother.”</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Huayang glanced at Fang Ting behind Cultivator Chen from time to time. He was clearly more enthusiastic towards her than the others.</p><p>Cunning and astute, he recognized Fang Ting's special status, likely the most talented among the disciples, and was naturally greatly interested.</p><p>“Enough! Old scoundrel, you've gone too far!”</p><p>Cultivator Chen's finger nearly poked Elder Huayang's face, cursing in anger.</p><p>He seemed to have a prior grudge with Elder Huayang, having endured it until now, but he finally couldn't hold back any longer and decided to drop all pretense of civility.</p><p>“Why so angry, Junior Brother?”</p><p>Elder Huayang flicked his dust whisk, maintaining an immortal-like demeanor, his expression calm as he tried to appease Cultivator Chen. “The Sect Leader once said that the Smokewater Pavilion and the Wandou Sect are one. It's the same for disciples wherever they cultivate…”</p><p>Cultivator Chen became even angrier, rebuking, “Nonsense! If Senior Lu were present, he would never allow you to act so recklessly!”</p><p>Elder Huayang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he said faintly, “Do you really think so? Don't you know that our Yin-Yang Branch is not only the foundation of the Wandou Sect but also made great contributions to the sect, which led to the deaths of two highly regarded Senior Brothers? The impact has lingered to this day, and our current decline is not unrelated to that incident. Although the Sect Leader hails from Canglan Peak, would he really stand by and watch our Yin-Yang Branch continue to decline, ending up like Douniu Peak?”</p><p>Douniu Peak?</p><p>The Incarnation's heart stirred.</p><p>He had been inquiring for so long, but he had never heard anyone mention that the Wandou Sect also had a Douniu Peak.</p><p>The Wandou Sect's main peaks numbered five, known as the three Canglan Peaks and the two Yin-Yang Peaks.</p><p>As the name suggested, the Yin-Yang Peaks were the cultivation grounds for the Yin-Yang Branch disciples.</p><p>The three Canglan Peaks were for the Five Elements Branch disciples.  Two Grand Inheritances each occupied one peak, while the other disciples cultivated on the remaining peak, which also housed the Sect Leader's hall.</p><p>These matters were not secrets, even known outside the Wandou Sect.</p><p>Only Douniu Peak remained unknown.</p><p>Judging from Elder Huayang's tone, Douniu Peak seemed to have once been a branch of the Wandou Sect, with a status not much different from the Yin-Yang and Five Elements Branches. However, its fate seemed unfavorable, possibly having already perished.</p><p>Could it be that Qi Yunzi was a disciple of this branch? Was the reason he couldn't find any information because Douniu Peak had declined and no one cultivated that technique anymore?</p><p>However, there was a puzzling aspect.</p><p>Four hundred years ago, Qi Yunzi, a Core Formation realm expert, was still active. Even if the Douniu Peak branch had indeed declined, it shouldn't have vanished so quickly and completely.</p><p>The reasons behind this were probably only known to the higher-ups of the Wandou Sect.</p><p>Of course, these were all just the Incarnation's conjectures and judgments, which couldn't be taken as fact. He still needed to thoroughly investigate the ins and outs to understand what had happened within the Wandou Sect.</p><p>The Incarnation's thoughts raced, his intuition telling him that Douniu Peak should be significantly related to what he was looking for.</p><p>This infiltration of the Smokewater Pavilion was worth it.  He had effortlessly overheard this secret and finally had a direction, even if it was only fragmented information.</p><p>Elder Huayang and Cultivator Chen were still arguing.</p><p>The others, witnessing the quarrel between Core Formation realm cultivators for the first time, didn't dare to breathe loudly, fearing they would be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>“Absolutely not!”</p><p>Cultivator Chen waved his arm decisively. “Show him the door!”</p><p>“Are you truly so stubborn, Junior Brother?”</p><p>Elder Huayang's face darkened, and he snorted coldly. “You want the Sect Leader's decree? I'll write one for you right now.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Cultivator Chen was about to explode with rage.</p>
