<h1>Chapter 1040: Escape Route</h1><p>Think of defeat before victory.</p><p>Facing a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, there was no room for carelessness.</p><p>Qin Sang's first priority was to consider his escape route, in case the treasure snatch failed and Elder Ye was enraged. How could he safely retreat and avoid being hunted down?</p><p>Ming Wei and the Transfer Talisman she held were his safest escape route. However, the talisman might not be enough to fully protect them. He needed to carefully consider how to use it effectively.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you mean…"</p><p>Ming Wei hesitated.</p><p>She didn't fully believe Qin Sang.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Grandmaster breaking through the immortal restrictions and traversing the Trial Realm was too fantastical, unprecedented.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's cautious demeanor forced her to consider the possibility.</p><p>Within the cavern, various factions were intertwined. There were many formidable experts like Blood Bat and Daoist Xiaoyun. Each posed a greater threat than herself.</p><p>Qin Sang deceiving her wouldn't benefit him; it would be akin to severing his own arm.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the entrance at the cavern's edge. "Once Elder Ye makes his move, everyone else will be stunned, unable to react immediately. Our only opponent will be him. As long as we can escape from Elder Ye, we'll be safe. Fellow Daoist, you take the Transfer Talisman and wait in a hidden location. Once I retrieve the item, activate the talisman immediately…"</p><p>Ming Wei remained silent.</p><p>She understood that doing so meant Qin Sang would bear the brunt of the Nascent Soul Grandmaster's wrath, while she only needed to observe from a distance.</p><p>If things went south, she could easily retreat. The danger to her was indeed minimal.</p><p>However, this way, she would be too far from the Soul Cleansing Liquid. She could only choose to trust Qin Sang's abilities, placing all her hope on him.</p><p>Ming Wei raised her head, staring into Qin Sang's eyes. "When the time comes, you won't just grab your own bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid and leave, will you?"</p><p>"Since we're already offending Elder Ye, what's the difference between one or two bottles? With the Transfer Talisman in your hands, I naturally have to grab a bottle for you. Otherwise, if you tear up our agreement in anger, I'll have no escape route and be left with regret. If you don't trust me, I'm willing to swear a Heart Demon Oath."</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid was in both their interests, and it was also the reason Qin Sang could trust Ming Wei.</p><p>Facing a powerful enemy, they could only rely on each other.</p><p>"Alright! I only hope you keep your promise!"</p><p>Ming Wei knew the situation was dire.  With limited resources and numerous competitors, her chances were slim. Having received Qin Sang's promise, she tapped her foot and retreated from the cavern. However, she saw Qin Sang following her out.</p><p>Noticing Ming Wei's puzzled look, Qin Sang said, "Elder Ye is definitely aware of the Transfer Talisman's function. We can't use it under his nose. If he stays put, we'll have no way to escape. We need to set up a diversion…"</p><p>The surrounding stone walls of the cavern were riddled with openings. After searching, they found the most complex entrance, which branched into several tunnels.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a diversion. He patted his Corpse Puppet Bag, and several Devil Corpses jumped out, each entering a different tunnel and lying in wait on Qin Sang's command.</p><p>Then, with a flick of his sleeve, small, intricate banners spiraled out, a total of nine!</p><p>Over the past decade, Qin Sang had been continuously attempting to control the Nine Banners Demonic Formation and had made considerable progress.</p><p>Ming Wei looked at the banners, surprised.</p><p>She could vaguely sense that these seemingly inconspicuous black banners were not simple. Having been by her master's side, her experience far surpassed other cultivators of the same level.  Yet she couldn't see through the banners' origins for a moment.</p><p>They looked like formation flags, but also like magical treasures. Very strange.</p><p>Ming Wei knew these treasures were definitely Qin Sang's secret and suppressed her curiosity, not asking any further questions.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The nine banners flickered rapidly, instantly forming a complex formation in front of Qin Sang. Black demonic flames seemed to flicker on their surfaces.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the formation, sensing its power. Then, he pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>*Thud! Thud! Thud!...*</p><p>The nine banners sank into the ground, disappearing completely.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Ming Wei and returned to the cavern.</p><p>Ming Wei had already vaguely guessed the purpose of Qin Sang's arrangement. Seeing Qin Sang's figure disappear among the Earth Spirit army, she took out several puppets from her storage pouch and ordered them to enter the depths of the tunnels. She then held the Transfer Talisman, her gaze fixed on the sealing barrier at the center of the cavern.</p><p>Her palms were clenched tightly, her nerves taut.</p><p>Back in the cavern, Qin Sang flew his sword into the Earth Spirit army, rapidly advancing forward.</p><p>The cultivators were attacking the sealing barrier; the ownership of the Soul Cleansing Liquid would soon be decided.</p><p>On the way, Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag. After a brief exchange, he and Qin Sang separated.  The situation in the cavern was chaotic, and no one noticed Bai's Corpse Refiner identity.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>With a sword strike, he repelled an Earth Spirit, breaking out of the encirclement.</p><p>More Earth Spirits immediately surrounded him. The closer he got to the sealing barrier, the stronger the Earth Spirits became.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his sword, moved closer and closer to the sealing barrier, finally able to see the scene within.</p><p>A tall platform stood at the center of the barrier.</p><p>Its surface was carved with strange patterns, like runes.</p><p>The platform was large, with only four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid placed on it, appearing quite empty.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully but didn't find any mechanisms on the platform. He didn't know how the Soul Cleansing Liquid appeared there or where it came from.</p><p>The seal was not yet broken; it wasn't time for the final battle.</p><p>However, each cultivator harbored their own intentions, their positioning carefully chosen, undercurrents surging.</p><p>No one knew who had secretly colluded with whom.</p><p>If not for Elder Ye, if things progressed naturally, it would surely be a spectacular drama of trust and betrayal.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across Elder Ye.</p><p>Like Blood Bat and the others, Elder Ye was diligently attacking the seal, not revealing anything unusual. No one would guess a Nascent Soul Grandmaster was among them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't let his Skyeye Butterfly spy on Elder Ye, fearing detection.</p><p>However, by observing Elder Ye's actions, Qin Sang did notice some oddities.</p><p>Facing the Earth Spirit army, Elder Ye always gave off an air of effortless ease. Although he had disguised himself, he inadvertently displayed an incredibly precise control over his True Essence, which secretly startled Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind Elder Ye, Su Nü and the others formed a battle formation, entangled with the Earth Spirit army.</p><p>Su Nü's eyes held no excitement, only deep worry.</p><p>She didn't know what Qin Sang's chances of success were.</p><p>If Qin Sang perished at Elder Ye's hands, she would also lose all hope, left only to await her fate.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the other two had begun transmitting their voices to each other, discussing the future with a relaxed tone, demonstrating immense confidence in Elder Ye.  Hearing their transmission, Su Nü forced a smile, deflecting the conversation.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Sword Qi, blade light.</p><p>Dao techniques, magical treasures.</p><p>Attacks relentlessly bombarded the sealing barrier.</p><p>The barrier trembled constantly, its light gradually dimming, becoming increasingly thin.</p><p>All the cultivators stared intently at the Soul Cleansing Liquid within, poised to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't choose to get too close to the seal. He remained on the periphery, warding off Earth Spirits while manipulating his Ebony Sword, sending streaks of Sword Qi and Sword Light towards the seal.</p><p>His attention was entirely focused on Elder Ye.</p>
