<h1>Chapter 401: A World-Shaking Battle</h1><p>Qin Sang didn't act rashly.</p><p>Undoubtedly, he sincerely hoped Yun Youzi could achieve his wish, heal his hidden injuries, and greatly improve his cultivation.</p><p>This wasn't solely due to their friendship.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang had the opportunity and time to focus on alchemy after forming his Gold Core, he would inevitably need to invite an alchemist to help refine the Tribulation Transcendence Pill for his Nascent Soul breakthrough.</p><p>The reward was secondary; the key was whether this person was capable enough and trustworthy.</p><p>It wasn't easy to find a reliable alchemist.  Treasures tempt people, especially a divine pill like the Tribulation Transcendence Pill.</p><p>Fortunately, Yun Youzi had a remarkable talent for alchemy.  In the early stage of Foundation Establishment, he had a seventy to eighty percent chance of successfully refining the Profound Mark Harmony Pill, which spoke volumes.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated a few steps, stood still, and quietly watched Yun Youzi.</p><p>Of course, his divine sense was always subtly focused on Yun Youzi. If Yun Youzi's situation turned dire, he would still help.</p><p>It hadn't reached that point yet.</p><p>On the path of cultivation, every hardship was a test.  Qin Sang understood this deeply.</p><p>What Yun Youzi was facing now was his trial, perhaps a chance for a breakthrough. If Qin Sang directly intervened, it might rob Yun Youzi of this opportunity.</p><p>Moreover, if he did intervene, he would have to explain how he could remain unharmed in the icy wind. While they were close, the existence of the Jade Buddha definitely couldn't be revealed to anyone.</p><p>One step, two steps…</p><p>Yun Youzi's steps grew smaller and smaller, the intervals longer and longer, but he continued forward, getting closer and closer to the Midnight Lily.</p><p>The tremors in the ice cave became increasingly violent and frequent, but they couldn't distract Yun Youzi.</p><p>He was completely focused. His aged body emitted a faint aura, his steps labored, but a spark within him burned eternally.</p><p>The Midnight Lily bloomed ahead, radiating immense allure.</p><p>But Yun Youzi's face showed no eagerness or greed. His expression remained calm and unwavering, whether his steps succeeded or failed, showing neither joy nor sorrow.</p><p>It seemed that even if he ultimately failed, froze here, and perished, he wouldn't be moved.</p><p>Qin Sang watched quietly, lost in thought, slightly lowering his head, reviewing his journey on the path of immortality.  His mindset seemed to have shifted slightly.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar startled Qin Sang from his contemplation.</p><p>The ice cave shook violently!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly raised his head and turned to look ahead.</p><p>This sound was extraordinary.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>In the next moment, countless ice shards surged into the ice cave like a tidal wave.</p><p>In an instant, the energy within the ice cave became incredibly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly sensed a change in Yun Youzi behind him. Turning his head, he saw a small flame ignite in the green lamp on Yun Youzi's chest, melting the ice.</p><p>Yun Youzi roared, his eyes wide, staring fixedly at the Midnight Lily. He stamped his foot, his figure darting forward like a hawk, reaching a spot just a step away from the Midnight Lily!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but admire him inwardly. Due to the sudden change ahead, the continuous icy wind had momentarily faltered. This opportunity was extremely brief, just a fleeting instant.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't disappointed him, seizing this chance with a desperate gamble.</p><p>After covering a considerable distance, Yun Youzi stopped again. This burst had consumed a great deal of his strength, and he needed time to recover.  But it was all worth it; the Midnight Lily was within his grasp.</p><p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Yun Youzi could obtain the Midnight Lily without Qin Sang's help.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze back, staring into the depths of the ice cave. The roar earlier seemed like an omen, and the tremors were becoming more frequent. He didn't know if the ice cave was within an ice mountain or at the bottom of an ice plain.</p><p>In any case, the entire world seemed to be shaking.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense that the source wasn't nearby but far ahead. They were only affected by the aftershocks, yet the ice cave seemed so fragile.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous boom echoed, like a collapsing ice mountain, shaking the world.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He glanced at Yun Youzi, then quietly leaped forward.</p><p>After covering some distance, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, looking down at the fractured ice beneath his feet and the deep chasm below. He gasped, stepping back with lingering fear.</p><p>This seemed to be the entrance to the ice cave.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to observe the surroundings, he inadvertently caught sight of a scene in the distant sky. His eyes narrowed, his expression changing drastically. He hurriedly hid behind a block of ice at the cave entrance, holding his breath, not daring to move.</p><p>He cautiously raised his head, looking upwards.</p><p>High above, a blue-white wind enveloped the sky.</p><p>This wind was the true form of the Frost Devil Wind. In fact, the Frost Devil Wind should be blue, but where it existed was always an extremely cold and desolate place, coexisting with ice and snow, dyeing the wind blue-white, making it easily visible.</p><p>Besides the Frost Devil Wind, nothing could be seen.</p><p>However, just now, for some unknown reason, a gap appeared in the uniform Frost Devil Wind. Through the gap, Qin Sang saw three figures standing in the air.</p><p>This fleeting glimpse shocked him deeply.</p><p>Two of them were human, both wearing black robes, looking familiar.</p><p>A giant, circular tortoise shell floated in front of one of them.  Recognizing the tortoise shell, Qin Sang realized these two black-robed figures were the mysterious experts they'd encountered after entering the inner valley of the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Now it was certain: they were Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>Only Nascent Soul cultivators could withstand the Frost Devil Wind's erosion and fight within it.</p><p>The other person wielded a spirit sword.  Qin Sang happened to see him swing the sword, its energy shattering the devil wind and splitting the sky.</p><p>The gap was actually a sword scar!</p><p>It was a move from the Shadowless Sword!</p><p>Qin Sang had heard Yun Youzi describe the Shadowless Sword and could now recognize it. This person was from the Limitless Gate; he was likely the one who killed the Starvenom Toad.</p><p>However, unlike their initial guess of a late-stage Core Formation expert, this person was a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator, the Limitless Gate Master!</p><p>The other figure wasn't human, resembling a large hawk-like beast.  Its wingspan could blot out the sky. Qin Sang couldn't see its full form, only glimpsing half of its body through the gap.</p><p>Lightning flashed on its feathers, eternally vibrant, as if it were a beast born from lightning. With a flap of its wings, it could summon thunderstorms, possessing world-destroying power!</p><p>Just now, it had flapped its wings, shooting out a dazzling lightning bolt that deflected the Limitless Gate Master's sword energy, forcing the other black-robed figure to raise the tortoise shell for defense.</p><p>“Could it be a Thunder Swallowing Falcon?”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the ancient texts he'd read, searching for a matching beast.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this Thunder Swallowing Falcon in the sky was a Transformation stage demon, and likely more than just early Transformation stage.  It could actually contend against two Nascent Soul cultivators!</p>
