<h1>Chapter 2165:  The Humble Hut and the Stone Seal</h1><p>Qin Sang first selected the jade slips. One was a topographical map drawn by Si Huang, marking the location of the cave.</p><p>After comparison, Qin Sang found that this place was not far from Chi Lake.</p><p>However, after obtaining the  *zhu*, the Si You royal family abandoned the place and hadn't been there for a long time.  It was unknown what changes had occurred in the interim.</p><p>The other jade slip was from the cave itself, but it didn't contain any records of cultivation techniques or secret arts. Otherwise, Si Huang might have been able to deduce the *zhu*'s origins, leaving nothing for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sent out a strand of spiritual sense, probing into the jade slip and carefully observing it.  After a short while, he let out a soft "hmm," his expression becoming more focused.</p><p>The content of the jade slip was very chaotic and disorganized, consisting of fragmented pieces of information, many meaningless, like the random jottings of someone writing down fleeting thoughts.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang found it increasingly interesting.</p><p>There were romantic poems, melancholic reflections, and several poems with no regard for formal structure.</p><p>Many entries simply recorded a scene the jade slip's owner had glimpsed, without context or conclusion.</p><p>For example, a place familiar from daily life, the mountains and water unchanged, only the weather, time, and people different; the scenery largely the same as before. Yet, at a certain moment, upon glimpsing this scene, the owner felt a strange sense of resonance.</p><p>The jade slip mentioned that this feeling was fleeting, its source unknown to the owner. Sometimes, he would linger, gazing at the spot for hundreds or even thousands of days and nights, yet never able to recapture it.</p><p>“The jade slip's owner must have been a very sensitive person…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Most people would forget such feelings instantly, not paying attention, or even being unaware of their existence.</p><p>However, such feelings might be the source of inspiration.</p><p>In ancient times, sages observed the heavens and earth to understand the Dao. Even today, people still can't fully comprehend the heavens, as if it were an endless book, with practitioners only seeing the tip of the iceberg.  Such a feeling might be an unintentional encounter with a fundamental truth of the Dao, a hidden opportunity.</p><p>Mythology is full of stories of sudden enlightenment, miraculous ascents, and even spontaneous ascension – unbelievable to cultivators who have diligently strived through hardship.  But who can say for sure that such things have never happened?</p><p>Cultivation techniques are merely guides left by predecessors. Before them, before techniques existed, people attained the Dao through direct enlightenment.</p><p>Qin Sang read with relish, almost forgetting his purpose.  By the end, he felt regret, for the owner's record was very brief, adding only simple thoughts and ideas, merely hinting at the details. Qin Sang longed to know if the owner had gained anything from these feelings, but the record stopped there, seemingly a casual note, quickly forgotten.</p><p>These inspirations were, of course, not directly applicable to Qin Sang, but he was not without gain.  From those few words, he received much inspiration and understood the owner's thought processes.</p><p>He had a feeling the jade slip’s owner was not a member of the Yi people, but rather someone whose way of thinking resembled that of human cultivators.</p><p>The Yi people and humans are born with different aptitudes.  The Yi possess innate bloodline abilities, which inevitably lead to differences in their understanding of the world, cultivation, and the Dao—something Qin Sang deeply understood. But he had interacted with few Yi people and had even fewer discussions with them, so he couldn't be certain.</p><p>Over the years, numerous human cultivators had entered the sacred land, but it was unknown if any powerful human cultivators had left caves there.  However, tracing back further, before becoming the sacred land of the Yi, Yuanjiao Mountain had other owners, perhaps even powerful human cultivators, leaving traces that remained to this day.</p><p>Withdrawing his spiritual sense, Qin Sang set the jade slip aside and examined the other items, one by one, finally focusing on one.</p><p>It was a golden book, shining brightly, woven from three golden pages, completely blank.  Activating it with true essence only produced a more dazzling golden light, with no other miraculous properties.</p><p>The other treasures were similar, seemingly unrelated to the Dao of Thunder.</p><p>Recalling the rhythm hidden within the *zhu*, Qin Sang repeatedly activated these treasures, testing them with thunder techniques.  He did make a new discovery.</p><p>This golden book also concealed a rhythm similar to the *zhu*!</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced, attempting to capture this rhythm, but failed. After some thought, he summoned the *zhu* and casually used a thunder technique.</p><p>The moment the sealing thunder technique was unleashed, a rhythm pulsed within the orb.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the two artifacts together, activating them simultaneously, hoping to synchronize their rhythms.</p><p>His efforts eventually paid off.  After repeated attempts, Qin Sang achieved a breakthrough. He distinctly felt the rhythm hidden within the golden book being triggered by the orb!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The golden book opened itself, radiating a golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, and saw mysterious lines appear on the golden pages, accompanied by countless arcane runes.  When all the patterns were activated, these lines combined to form what initially seemed to be a formation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly revised this assumption. The engravings on the golden book weren't a formation; they were more like instructions. The true mystery could only be understood upon encountering the actual spirit array.</p><p>"I wonder if that spirit array is within the cave dwelling.  It seems I'll have to go there myself," Qin Sang murmured, closing the golden book.</p><p>He glanced at the geomantic map, then towards the Red Lake, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>The Red Lake was calm, still showing no sign of the enemy.</p><p>The two locations weren't far apart; a quick check would be entirely feasible.  The only concern was the possibility of unforeseen circumstances, getting trapped and unable to escape.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang couldn't resist his curiosity and decided to investigate.</p><p>As for the Red Lake, the hope of eliminating the enemy there was already slim. Qin Sang's primary goal was to assess their strength.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring glowed, shooting out a beam of dark light. Min Zhuo, now a corpse-soldier, was summoned by Qin Sang.</p><p>After killing Ji Qiong and the others, Qin Sang had acquired one corpse. He also had the beast corpse, but considering that changing bodies might have limitations, and he needed help urgently, he kept the Wu Jin skull on Min Zhuo.</p><p>Leaving Min Zhuo to watch the Red Lake, Qin Sang left the cave, oriented himself, and stealthily departed.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his speed, surveying the land, his gaze constantly shifting, searching for his target.</p><p>He soon found what he was looking for, his figure flashing as he landed on the ground. Moving through the mountains and fields, he soon arrived at a body of water.</p><p>'Gurgling...'</p><p>Waves lapped against the shore rocks, a clear and pleasant sound.</p><p>A ray of dawn appeared on the horizon. Fish-scale patterns shimmered on the water's surface, and a light mist floated above, flowing like water.</p><p>Standing on the bank, Qin Sang stared into the depths of the morning mist, vaguely seeing the outline of an island – the place where he had found the orb.</p><p>From a distance, the island appeared exceptionally peaceful, a perfect place for self-cultivation, if its environment hadn't changed.  Qin Sang had this thought, then concealed himself and walked on water, moving through the mist until the island was close at hand.</p><p>The island was far larger up close than it appeared from the shore.  At a glance, Qin Sang saw dark, deep mountain shadows; nothing unusual was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>In fact, the island was protected by a defensive array, which was the reason for its continued existence.</p><p>After sensing it, Qin Sang confirmed that the defensive array was still active, but the existence of the cave dwelling within remained unknown.  The royal family of Siyou were not the only ones who knew about and had entered this island.</p><p>Perceiving the changes in the array's power, Qin Sang mentally deduced the situation for a while, then suddenly stepped out and landed on a black rock on the shore.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of cold wind swept in, and the scenery changed abruptly.</p><p>It was still the same island, but the black rock beneath Qin Sang's feet had disappeared. He had been unknowingly transported elsewhere.</p><p>The defensive array was a maze formation. The goal seemed to be close at hand, but was actually far away. Cultivators unfamiliar with exploration methods who rashly entered might be trapped here to die.</p><p>However, the pattern of the array was already known. Qin Sang chose not to forcefully break the formation, considering that there might be others on the island.</p><p>One wrong step in such a maze formation would undo all previous efforts.  Qin Sang remained calm, unmoved by the changing scenery around him, and walked slowly forward.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang saw mist rising around him, blurring the scene and increasing the difficulty of breaking the formation. He occasionally paused to deduce the formation, but his speed actually increased.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped abruptly, sensing something, frowning at what lay ahead.</p><p>Thick fog shrouded the area, obscuring the island's features. Qin Sang sensed an unusual aura there, seeming to belong to another cultivator.</p><p>The moment he stopped, that aura also stopped moving, confirming Qin Sang's guess.</p><p>Neither could see the other.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his celestial eye, but all he saw were several mountain shadows in the mist.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye hadn't failed; the opponent simply wasn't directly in front of him.  Likely, they were on the other side of the island. The labyrinthine array had interwoven their auras.</p><p>Qin Sang and his opponent faced off remotely. Qin Sang remained motionless, patient, secretly calculating the opponent's position.</p><p>After a while, the other party lost their composure first, unleashing a wave of oppressive power towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, then deployed his own pressure, confronting the attack head-on.</p><p>The two forces clashed, neither gaining an advantage.  Qin Sang pressed his assault, taking a step forward and unleashing an even stronger wave of power.</p><p>The opponent showed no signs of defeat, but displayed some hesitation, possibly due to Qin Sang's aggressive stance. After a brief stalemate, the opponent's aura suddenly subsided, their pressure rapidly receding.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The island trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up to see a blue light streak through the fog, vanishing instantly into the distance.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. The opponent had chosen to retreat, acting unusually cautious.  However, he reconsidered.  Their encounter suggested the opponent had already explored the island and was leaving when they ran into Qin Sang.</p><p>The figure within the blue light was indistinct. Qin Sang didn't know their tribe and had no intention of pursuing them.  He withdrew his pressure and continued deeper into the array.</p><p>Beyond the island, a blue light shot out, revealing a figure in the morning mist.</p><p>This person was tall and lanky, with unusually long limbs and four fingers on each hand, connected by webbed skin.  After flying beyond the island, they looked back, their eyes flickering, seemingly weighing something.</p><p>After a moment, they shook their head slightly, then departed, their figure vanishing into the distance.</p><p>…</p><p>A potential conflict dissolved without incident.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know what the individual would do next, but remained vigilant.  Cultivators participating in the trials usually came in groups; solo participants like him were rare.  Finding only one person, he couldn’t afford to be careless.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang passed through the island's protective array and entered the island.</p><p>It was already morning; the island was bright and sunny, birds sang, and flowers bloomed.  There were no rampaging beasts; it was like a normal world, teeming with birds and animals.</p><p>The island was large. The cave containing the Divine Pearl was only on one side; other similar hidden realms and ancient estates existed elsewhere.</p><p>However, according to Si Huang, after the island's protective array was broken, numerous cultivators had been attracted. Almost all the hidden realms and estates had been ransacked.</p><p>Instead of going straight to the cave, Qin Sang searched the island.  He was wary of potential accomplices and sought evidence to confirm his earlier deductions.</p><p>He explored other hidden realms. As Si Huang had said, they were all empty, only dilapidated pavilions and towers remained; even the decorations had been removed.</p><p>After his investigation, Qin Sang confirmed there was no one else on the island and flew towards the cave.</p><p>'Rumbling!'</p><p>A white waterfall cascaded down from the sky, the sound of water deafening.</p><p>Reaching the top of the waterfall, Qin Sang found a grove of pines. With a flick of his fingers, several beams of light shot into the woods, instantly forming an array to seal off the area.</p><p>He landed, walked through the woods, and found a clearing where a thatched hut stood. Old, low, and dilapidated, it was nonetheless still standing.</p><p>Seeing that the place hadn't been destroyed, Qin Sang relaxed, stepped forward, and gently pushed open the half-opened wooden door.  A long altar, or rather, a stone platform, met his gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shifted to the left of the stone platform.</p><p>This was where the Divine Pearl and other items were placed.  The surface showed the imprints of objects left there for a long time.  Qin Sang immediately saw a square indentation – the clear mark where the golden book had rested.</p><p>Inside the hut, Qin Sang didn't sense any array, but seeing the golden book's imprint, he felt a sudden urge to return the book to its place.</p><p>His expression shifted.  He didn’t act immediately, but exited the hut, standing before it, gazing into the distance.</p><p>After waiting a long time, without seeing the person return, Qin Sang went back inside, took out the golden book, gently placed it in the indentation, and then activated the hidden mechanism within the book.</p>
