Chapter 1296: Betrayal

"Could this be a trap?"
Bai, upon seeing the contents of the jade slip, was equally astonished and somewhat incredulous.
No wonder Qin Sang referred to him as a lucky general.
He had only been at the front lines for ten days when, without any warning, chaos suddenly erupted in Yu City, suspected to be caused by internal strife within the Sin Abyss.
At a time when the war was going smoothly and they were on the verge of attacking Tianxing City, the Sin Abyss had not fallen into internal conflict over the spoils.
Now, with defeat almost certain and the slightest misstep potentially leading to utter ruin, why would they engage in internal strife at such a critical moment, giving the two-region alliance an opportunity to benefit? Could the Sin Abyss really be so foolish?
Who were the parties involved in this internal conflict?
What was the cause?
Qin Sang was also pondering these questions.
"Elder Zhenyi has sent a message summoning all Nascent Soul cultivators. He must have some confidence in this news and wouldn't act without reason. Senior Sister and Jingyu are on their way. We'll find out what's really going on once we meet Elder Zhenyi."
After the time it takes to burn an incense stick, two streaks of light flew over the city, revealing Qing Jun and Jingyu.
Sensing their auras, Qin Sang stepped out of the stone house.
Li Yufu and others were waiting outside. "Uncle-Master, everyone has arrived."
Earlier, Qin Sang had suddenly changed his orders. Everyone, who had been in meditation, was awakened and now stood ready.
Qin Sang looked around and said gravely, "Yufu, you must set out immediately. Do not delay on the way. Head to Caishi City at the fastest speed possible!"
Caishi City was one of the largest cities on the plain and had already been captured. Elder Zhenyi was currently in the city.
Li Yufu was startled. "Uncle-Master, what has happened?"
"Don't worry, it's good news!"
With a light step, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of light and soared into the sky, joining Qing Jun and Jingyu.
The three of them, along with Bai who had entered the Corpse Puppet Bag, flew non-stop to Caishi City.
As they arrived at the city gates, several streaks of light approached from another direction, landing beside them. It was Tongyou Demon Lord, Dongyang Bo, and others.
Each harboring their own thoughts, they nodded to each other and hurried into the city, eager to find Elder Zhenyi and get to the bottom of things.
Inside Caishi City.
Originally, the dominant force in Caishi City was a cultivator family, but they had retreated with the Sin Abyss army.
This family occupied the most central location in Caishi City.
Amidst the desolate plain, this place was a haven of birdsong and fragrant flowers, with lakes and mountains reflecting each other, resembling a paradise south of the Yangtze River. The scenery was delightful, rivaling that of any cultivator sect, exuding a sense of profound seclusion within the bustling world.
Qin Sang and the others entered the core hall at the mountain's peak and saw Elder Zhenyi, who was already accompanied by several figures.
"Fellow Daoists, you've arrived."
Elder Zhenyi stood up to greet them, nodding with a smile.
"We happened to meet outside the city," Tongyou Demon Lord strode in, his eyes fixed on Elder Zhenyi, cutting straight to the point. "Old Daoist, is the urgent news you sent true or false?"
Tongyou Demon Lord was clearly skeptical of the news's authenticity.
It was too unbelievable, defying common sense!
Elder Zhenyi, still smiling, gestured inward. "Fellow Daoist, please be patient. A few more Daoists will arrive shortly. Then, I will disclose all the information, and we can verify its truth together."
...
Qin Sang and Qing Jun found seats and sat down, secretly communicating via voice transmission.
More people arrived one after another, and various armies were also converging on Caishi City. Soon, the last person arrived, and all the Nascent Soul cultivators from the front lines were present.
At this moment, Elder Zhenyi cleared his throat, looked around, and slightly bowed. "I know all of you have doubts. To be honest, I was also startled when I received the news, fearing it might be a conspiracy, and not a very clever trap at that. But I can assure you, the source of this news is very reliable. I wouldn't say it's absolutely certain, but I'm at least ninety-nine percent confident!"
Elder Zhenyi spoke with conviction, exuding great confidence.
Some were swayed by Elder Zhenyi's tone, believing him seven or eight parts. Others remained vigilant, even beginning to suspect Elder Zhenyi's intentions, especially those from the Cold Domain.
As the situation gradually became clearer, internal conflicts within the alliance began to surface.
Especially after seeing the abundant resources on the plain, the various forces from the two regions maintained a superficial harmony, but covert struggles were inevitable.
Fortunately, the two-region alliance was aware of this and had already agreed that all resources would be fairly distributed based on contributions after the war. Otherwise, internal conflicts would have erupted long ago.
Everyone exchanged glances, their expressions varied.
It was well known that the two-region alliance and the Sin Abyss had been in constant conflict over the plain, with grievances dating back a long time.
During this period, mutual infiltration was common.
Elder Zhenyi must have a deeply hidden informant, and one he trusted greatly!
As everyone's thoughts raced, Elder Zhenyi continued, "While summoning all of you, I received two more messages, more detailed."
Elder Zhenyi paused slightly.
"First, the cause of the chaos in Yu City was the betrayal of Elder Ye. Second, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss were mostly in Yu City and, caught off guard, were slaughtered by Elder Ye alone, suffering heavy losses!"
As soon as these words were spoken, an uproar erupted.
"What?"
"How is that possible! Has Elder Ye gone mad?"
"Elder Ye alone slaughtered the other Nascent Soul cultivators?"
...
The hall was filled with old-timers who had cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage and experienced countless storms. They were usually unshakable, and ordinary events rarely stirred their emotions.
But now, they were all visibly shocked, with even a few exclamations heard.
They had expected Elder Zhenyi to present some solid evidence, but instead, they heard something even more absurd.
"Elder Ye betrayed them? Half of the Sin Abyss is his. Who could persuade him to betray and offer him greater benefits?" someone questioned, hitting the core of the matter.
Qin Sang couldn't help but recall a sayingâ€”"Your Majesty, why rebel?"
Even more unbelievable was that Elder Ye alone slaughtered the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss.
"Even if those old fogies aren't that capable, they still have the Nether Crystal Tower. Working together, even a late-stage Nascent Soul expert couldn't gain an advantage in Yu City. Since when did Elder Ye possess such terrifying power?"
But Elder Zhenyi said with certainty, "It was indeed a slaughter. Those killed couldn't even escape with their Nascent Souls, and others were severely injured! As for the Nether Crystal Tower, Elder Ye secretly destroyed it. By the time others realized something was wrong, it was already too late."
"The Nether Crystal Tower was destroyed by Elder Ye..."
Everyone was stunned.
One shocking news after another, each more explosive than the last.
The Nether Crystal Tower, with its mysterious origins, was one of the Sin Abyss's greatest assets, capable of both offense and defense, highly versatile and difficult to deal with. Its appearance on the battlefield had given the two-region alliance a headache.
If not for the Nether Crystal Tower, the two-region alliance wouldn't have struggled so much.
"Regardless of Elder Ye's intentions, what was his final outcome? What's the situation in Yu City now? What was the result of this internal strife?"
Qing Jun fired off several questions in rapid succession.
Upon hearing these news, her expression remained calm. She had been slightly bowing her head, deep in thought, and only spoke up now.
