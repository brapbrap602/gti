<h1>Chapter 1057:  A Palace in the Clouds</h1><p>Chapter 1057:  A Palace in the Clouds</p><p>Ning Wuhuai walked and stopped, occasionally changing direction, as if searching for something.  After crossing several mountain ranges, his gaze fell upon a distant peak.  After observing for a moment, a delighted expression appeared on his face.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. They weren't even near the Spirit-镇灵域 yet.</p><p>He looked closely. The mountain was very high, its peak touching the celestial barrier, shrouded in radiant light. However, similar peaks were numerous in the mountain range surrounding Yitian Peak; nothing about this one seemed particularly special.</p><p>Shortly, the two arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The space within the secluded valley was more stable than elsewhere, but spatial rifts were still present. This mountain happened to have one, stretching across its middle.</p><p>They were used to it by now.  Confirming no other dangers on the mountain, they concealed themselves and flew upwards.</p><p>A man-made stone path was clearly visible, winding its way through forests and valleys to the summit.</p><p>Along the path were dried-up streams, dilapidated pavilions, and collapsed ancient halls—all common sights. There were no remaining restrictions, and no trace of a hidden realm.</p><p>This kind of mountain must have been explored by cultivators long ago.  Once its lack of value was determined, it was gradually abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Ning Wuhuai all the way to the summit.</p><p>They stood almost directly beneath the celestial barrier, the radiant light shimmering around them.</p><p>Experiencing the celestial barrier's power firsthand was terrifying.</p><p>An ancient hall stood on the summit, once clearly magnificent and exquisite.  But with the ancient cultivators gone and the restrictions faded, the hall could not endure.</p><p>Time had taken its toll; the hall was covered in dust, with collapsed and broken structures everywhere.</p><p>The main gate was gone.</p><p>The two entered through the empty doorway, proceeding cautiously, leaving no trace.</p><p>After passing through several halls, they entered a spacious square.</p><p>The square was circular, surrounded by broken stone pillars. Some were reduced to their bases; even the intact ones had lost their former splendor and returned to ordinary stone.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai went to the center of the square, tilting his head to gaze at the celestial barrier above.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, quietly observing Ning Wuhuai. A strange look flashed in his eyes, vaguely guessing where the path Ning Wuhuai spoke of was.</p><p>The radiant light was blinding, but Ning Wuhuai's eyes shone like stars, his gaze piercing through the light to see the barrier's essence.</p><p>After searching for a while, Ning Wuhuai suddenly took a step forward, then formed his hand into a blade and slashed upwards.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>True energy formed a crescent-shaped blade of light, plunging into the depths of the radiant light.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened; he secretly mobilized his true energy, fearing a backlash from the celestial barrier. Even if they could escape safely, the phenomenon would be impossible to conceal.</p><p>If they attracted a Yuan Ying ancestor, they'd be in serious trouble.</p><p>However, his fears proved unfounded.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai continued to strike, sending waves of true energy into the barrier with carefully calculated movements. The radiant light fluctuated, but subtly. The barrier, despite repeated attacks, showed no sign of counterattack.</p><p>Suddenly, a heart-stopping wave emanated from within the barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Fortunately, the wave appeared and disappeared quickly, leaving only ripples in the radiant light that soon faded away.</p><p>“Go up!  Remember, don't leak any true energy or spiritual sense fluctuations!”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai shouted, soaring into the air.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, casting aside his worries and dashing into the square, following Ning Wuhuai straight into the celestial barrier.</p><p>He watched helplessly as he was gradually enveloped by the radiant light, his vision lost. He dared not use his spiritual sense to investigate.</p><p>He instantly prepared all his defensive measures.</p><p>As they ascended, Qin Sang suddenly felt a tightening, a powerful wind assaulting him.  He steadied himself and pressed on upward against the gale.</p><p>The good news was that, aside from the wind, there was no backlash from the barrier.</p><p>Only the wind grew fiercer.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt his body lighten, then Ning Wuhuai pulled him.  His feet landed on solid ground.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, hurriedly opening his eyes to a breathtaking sight.</p><p>He couldn’t tell if he was above or within the celestial barrier.</p><p>The radiant light still filled the sky, but it wasn't monotonous.</p><p>Before him stretched a boundless sea of clouds, intertwined with the light, creating a fantastical scene of colorful radiance.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, unable to believe that such a world existed within the celestial barrier.</p><p>He looked down, seeing a long jade corridor extending from the depths of the cloud sea, abruptly ending at his feet.</p><p>Even more surprising was a flaw in the celestial barrier beneath the corridor.  It was unclear whether this was a deliberately created exit or damage caused by some external force.</p><p>This flaw was only visible from above.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai's palm strikes had precisely targeted the flaw, creating a small opening for them to enter.</p><p>"The barrier is above? No, it's all around!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>He found that the white jade corridor was surrounded by shimmering light, with interwoven runes radiating a dangerous aura.</p><p>They were surrounded by clouds and light, with nothing visible but the jade corridor beneath their feet. Everything else seemed illusory.</p><p>The corridor extended towards what appeared to be magnificent palaces and pavilions, like the dwellings of immortals.</p><p>North, West, East...</p><p>In every direction, there were celestial palaces and mountains, adorned with vibrant flowers, a breathtaking scene.</p><p>The clouds and light were not static; they swirled, causing the palaces and mountains to appear and disappear, sometimes fragmented, sometimes whole.</p><p>It was unclear whether this was an illusion created by some kind of restriction, or if the palaces were real, their visibility simply distorted by the barrier.</p><p>No one knew if these were real or merely phantoms.</p><p>Below the barrier, including the inner hall, everything was desolate. The void itself was shattered, riddled with spatial fissures.</p><p>Some areas clearly indicated past grandeur, hinting at powerful former inhabitants, but even they couldn't escape the ravages of time.  The buildings were almost entirely ruined; it was hard to find a single intact structure.</p><p>But within the barrier, the palaces were pristine, their former splendor perfectly preserved.</p><p>This was exactly what mortals imagined a celestial court to be like.</p><p>Only the absence of immortals made these magnificent palaces feel lifeless and silent.</p><p>Stunned by the sight, Qin Sang turned his head to the last direction.</p><p>His gaze sharpened, fixing on something.</p><p>That direction held no palaces, only emptiness, except for a shadowy, black tower, its top unseen, its height unknown.</p><p>"The Sky Tower!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled; he recognized the shadow as the upper half of the Sky Tower!</p><p>Suddenly, many things clicked into place.  The others must have seen him fall not from the outer hall, but from above the celestial barrier!</p>
