<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang's cultivation is not what it once was; his understanding of sword formations is now far deeper than when he was in the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>As the only sword formation within the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* (Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit) technique, the Seven Souls Killing Formation undoubtedly possesses the ability to challenge opponents of a higher level.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang is currently wielding the *Jin Chen Jian* (Gold Inscription Sword), a top-grade spiritual sword, and not his natal spirit sword, the *Yun You Jian* (Wandering Cloud Sword), its power should not be underestimated.</p><p>More importantly, Qin Sang's divine sense has greatly improved, allowing him not only to control the sword formation more effortlessly but also to extend the range of its influence far beyond what it used to be.</p><p>This is why he is confident and daring enough to employ a little trick, trapping two people with a single sword formation.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang's purpose is not to kill these two fellow cultivators.</p><p>His opponents are not like him, newly entered into the mid Nascent Soul stage, but rather well-established veterans who have made a name for themselves, and hail from renowned sects, so they are bound to possess protective treasures.</p><p>If his opponents stubbornly resist, Qin Sang will face a protracted battle.</p><p>The longer the situation drags on, the more disadvantageous it becomes for him, so he must try his best to avoid it.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Gong (Profound Heaven Palace) experts who might arrive at any moment, and the Old Devil Hunmo (Chaos Demon) who might be attracted, are all threats to him.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang's goal has remained unchanged: capture the green-robed woman alive, immediately escape, find out the truth, and then consider his next actions.</p><p>*‘Swoosh!’*</p><p>*‘Swoosh!’*</p><p>Elder Lan and Elder Mei are seasoned veterans with rich experience. They sensed that something was amiss and decisively split up to flee in different directions, preventing their opponent from attending to both of them.</p><p>This way, even if one person is trapped, the other can rescue or harass the opponent.</p><p>Despite their swift reactions, they miscalculated.</p><p>Qin Sang's sword incantation changed continuously, without reservation. The *Jin Chen Jian*'s main body vanished into thin air, and the Seven Souls Killing Formation instantly took shape, enveloping both Elder Mei and Elder Lan.</p><p>Both of their expressions revealed shock. In that instant, they sensed the changes in their surroundings and the strange fluctuations, their gazes sweeping around rapidly.</p><p>They saw a layer of black veil covering the void.</p><p>Adding to the fact that the effects of the Glacial Rune had not yet dissipated, it truly felt as if they were in the dead of night.</p><p>At this moment, the figures of their companions and their opponent became extremely blurred and illusory, making it difficult to distinguish between reality and illusion. They felt as if they were isolated in an independent space, and their connection with their companions was severed.</p><p>In the shadows, countless fine sword threads, indiscernible to the naked eye, appeared and unhesitatingly attacked them, accompanied by silent vibrations.</p><p>A strange wave permeated the air.</p><p>"Sword Formation!"</p><p>Elder Mei blurted out, his heart filled with even greater dread.</p><p>To transform a sword into myriad forms, creating a sword formation, is something only the most elite sword cultivators can accomplish.</p><p>No wonder the Sacred Object fell into this person's hands. They can only blame that wretch for his bad luck, for managing to steal the Sacred Object only to provoke such a powerful figure.</p><p>Since the opponent dared to bring the Sacred Object to the Myriad Demons Assembly, it means that this person is not aware of the Sacred Object and the wretch's origins; otherwise, he would not be so careless.</p><p>That wretch has transformed into an Ice Demon physique, and his spirit body is solidified, making it very difficult for ordinary people to perform a soul search on him.</p><p>In an instant, Elder Mei and Elder Lan understood the situation, and they spoke in unison, loudly proclaiming a misunderstanding in an attempt to defuse the situation.</p><p>Shi Xue suffered a quick defeat, using several treasures in succession, leaving her with little true essence and almost no combat power.</p><p>Against such a powerful figure, unless they were confident of killing him on the spot, it was best not to make an enemy. The Xuan Tian Gong is a large and powerful sect. If an opponent is strong, fast, elusive, and single-mindedly sets out to make trouble for the Xuan Tian Gong, they would also be in a great deal of trouble.</p><p>It might be better to change tactics; it would be best if they could exchange other treasures for the Sacred Object.</p><p>They did not believe that such a large Xuan Tian Gong could not satisfy this person's appetite!</p><p>There was no deep blood feud between the two sides, and the other party had helped Xuan Tian Gong deal with the traitor. If they could handle it properly, they might be able to form a good relationship and gain a powerful ally.</p><p>In fact, they had considered this situation before and how to deal with it.</p><p>But they did not expect Qin Sang to attack like a thunderbolt, not giving Shi Xue a chance to speak.</p><p>Elder Mei and Elder Lan were making wishful calculations, but they did not understand the opponent's thinking. Seeing that this person had a vengeful attitude, how could they dare to stop on their own initiative?</p><p>Elder Mei recognized the sword formation, and a grey light flashed in his palm, revealing a hairpin-sized long needle.</p><p>The surface of this needle was greyish-white, and it was unknown what kind of bone it was made from. The end was carved into a complete skull, with ghost fire flickering in the empty eye sockets, and its mouth opening and closing, spewing out a ghastly white flame, eerie and bizarre.</p><p>This was one of Elder Mei's famous magical treasures, the *Tou Gu Zhen* (Bone-Penetrating Needle).</p><p>If an opponent is pierced by the Bone-Penetrating Needle, and the ghost fire invades their body, they will suffer the pain of Yin ghosts gnawing at their heart, one of the most excruciating punishments in the world.</p><p>In addition, the Bone-Penetrating Needle can also be used to break restrictions and formations, and is quite effective, so it can be called a unique magical treasure, and it is perfect for resolving the danger at this time.</p><p>Elder Mei grabbed the Bone-Penetrating Needle, heard the sound of ghosts weeping, and was about to activate it, when he suddenly felt a dizzy spell and a headache, and his consciousness became somewhat dazed.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Elder Mei was shocked.</p><p>The sword formation can actually attack the primordial spirit!</p><p>She forcefully bit the tip of her tongue, using the intense pain to forcibly maintain clarity. Her palm reached down and the drop of ice water returned and then suddenly disappeared. She was now wearing a suit of Black Ice Armor, including her head, which was protected, leaving no flaws.</p><p>‘Ding ding dang dang…’</p><p>A series of explosions rang out, and countless sword threads took the opportunity to attack, leaving visible sword marks on the surface of the Black Ice Armor.</p><p>Elder Mei felt a pang of fear. Fortunately, she responded in time and did not lose her mind. She protected herself in time; otherwise, she would have already been injured!</p><p>Elder Lan's experience was similar to that of Elder Mei.</p><p>He has a secret technique to stabilize his primordial spirit. Noticing that the sword formation could attack the primordial spirit, he unhesitatingly activated the secret technique, and his eyes shot out scorching divine light, stabilizing his spiritual platform.</p><p>Outside the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang successfully trapped the two elders, immediately shifted his gaze, and looked at the real target.</p><p>He did not intend to trap and kill the two elders, so he did not pay attention to any strategies. He decisively activated the sword formation, unleashed its full power, and took advantage of the opponent's distraction. He transformed into lightning, crossed the sword formation, and went straight for Shi Xue!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Shi Xue understood Qin Sang's intention. In front of the two elders, he still did not want to let her go.</p><p>The key is that the other party really has this strength.</p><p>The two elders were trapped by the sword formation and could not escape immediately.</p><p>"This madman!"</p><p>Shi Xue, who thought she was safe after the elders arrived, felt her eyelids twitching wildly. She bit her lips tightly and now regretted provoking such a powerful enemy for no reason.</p><p>She mustered her remaining strength to escape into the distance, but her speed was far inferior to Qin Sang's. She watched Qin Sang approach rapidly, her eyes filled with despair.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He sensed another aura approaching rapidly, comparable to the green-robed woman. It should also be in the peak early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Other Xuan Tian Gong experts are arriving one after another..."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the opportunity was fleeting. Ignoring the newcomer, he channeled the *Ruyi Baozhu* (As-You-Wish Pearl) in his Qi Sea, and his defensive *gang* (true energy) protected his body. His speed increased instead of decreasing!</p><p>He was about to catch up with Shi Xue.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a inexplicable sense of unease in his heart, as if some danger was approaching.</p>
