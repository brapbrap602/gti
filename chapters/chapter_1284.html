<h1>Chapter 1276: Passing Down the Teachings</h1><p>Chapter 1276: Passing Down the Teachings</p><p>Soon, news arrived from the Allied Forces of the Two Realms, requesting that the grandmasters of each sect lead their troops to the Tianxing Plateau to organize a counteroffensive.</p><p>Qing Jun was reorganizing his forces. This decisive battle would see both realms deploying their entire armies to the Tianxing Plateau.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by Jing Yu, went to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea first.</p><p>Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>The demons, having received the news, waited outside the valley.</p><p>The white cat, learning that its master would be bringing a demon king back to the mountain, stood beside the willow demon, stiff and formal, its round face tense, its almond eyes wide, afraid of committing a faux pas in front of the demon king.</p><p>The fat chicken glared at the white crane beside it, its eyes blazing, inwardly cursing.</p><p>The white crane, deliberately rubbing shoulders with Yue'er in front of it, acted affectionately.</p><p>The white crane cackled with laughter, casually approaching the fat chicken, extending its wing to embrace the chicken, its face full of envy, saying boisterously, “I never thought you were actually a demon king's descendant, you little rascal! You're made! Don't forget your brother when you get rich! I'll have Yue'er bring over her sisters, you can pick anyone, three or four wives are no problem!”</p><p>“My name is Chi Lei!”</p><p>The fat chicken roared angrily.</p><p>Yue'er, with a hint of jealousy, pinched the white crane, her breath like a fragrant breeze, “Do you want three or four wives too?”</p><p>“My heart belongs only to you, heaven and earth can bear witness, my eyes cannot hold any other little fairy,”</p><p>The white crane said without changing its expression.</p><p>Yue'er blushed with shyness and sweetness.</p><p>The white crane sighed inwardly. There was no way; Yue'er was protected by the Serpent King, and its master didn't show any favoritism towards it. It couldn't be beaten nor scolded.</p><p>Fortunately, it was smooth-talking and had charmed Yue'er completely, so it hadn't suffered at all, but had enjoyed much tenderness.</p><p>However, Yue'er was very clingy, preventing it from going out and having fun, making it rather stifled.</p><p>The fat chicken, knowing the white crane's nature, sneered, “Keep them for yourself, I'm not worthy.”</p><p>Just as they were speaking, Qin Sang and Jing Yu quietly appeared before them.</p><p>Jing Yu, having heard the white crane's words, showed great interest, “If you know any kind and virtuous girls, you can try to introduce them. If you can find a good match for Little Fat, this king will thank you properly.”</p><p>The fat chicken was startled.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang introduced Jing Yu to the demons, explaining that Jing Yu would stay in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to cultivate from now on.</p><p>Jing Yu agreed and promised to offer guidance when time allowed, much to the demons' delight.</p><p>After the demons met Jing Yu, Qin Sang kept the willow demon, the old monkey, the white cat, the fat chicken, and the white crane, taking out several jade slips.</p><p>“Take a look at these cultivation techniques.”</p><p>Qin Sang said, handing one to Jing Yu as well.</p><p>The jade slips contained the first four layers of the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>After the counteroffensive against the Abyss of Sin, things would finally settle down. These demons could be trusted; Qin Sang chose them to pass down the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, preserving the legacy of the demon race, preventing the technique from being lost with her.</p><p>The willow demon, being a plant spirit, couldn't cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, but could still gain some insights from it.</p><p>Upon receiving the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, the demons were instantly shocked and immersed themselves in it, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>Jing Yu was the first to recover, his eyes filled with undisguised surprise, “This technique must have been a supreme legacy of a great clan in ancient times. Fellow Daoist, you actually obtained the complete first four layers! Unfortunately, I've immersed myself too deeply in my own clan's inheritance to change my cultivation path. However, the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* will still greatly benefit me. After studying it for a while, I will surely gain something. Thank you, Daoist Qin!”</p><p>“Are even the top-tier inheritances of the demon race incomplete?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jing Yu nodded, “Mostly so. Our clan's inheritance was created by a brilliant ancestor who gained insights from a fragmentary ancient demon cultivation technique. It was passed down through generations before gradually becoming more complete.”</p><p>The demon race of the Xiao Han Realm was similar. The top-tier inheritances of humans, witches, and demons were all incomplete.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>After a while, the demons finally came to their senses, expressing their deep gratitude to Qin Sang, bowing down and chanting in unison, “Thank you, Great King, for passing down your teachings.”</p><p>“Rise. From now on, the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea and the Qingyang Temple are all considered my descendants, no distinction will be made between us. Remember, you must not harbor any inter-species prejudice, otherwise, if any trouble arises, I will not show mercy!”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, saying solemnly, “These teachings cannot be passed on lightly. Several rules must be established within the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea…”</p><p>That night, Qin Sang led the demons to the Tianxing Plateau.</p><p>Jingyu remains in seclusion at Qianshan Bamboo Sea, focusing on her cultivation.  She won't rush her breakthrough with medicine; she's ready to reinforce the battle at any time.</p><p>...</p><p>At the Ice Crystal Palace on Tianxing Plateau, the Yuan Ying cultivators gathered.</p><p>As Qin Sang entered the hall, all eyes turned to him.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, you’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi himself rose to greet him, his eyes shining with excitement.  "I've long admired the strength of the Moon Demon King among the demon clan. Now I see that humanity possesses such remarkable young talents!"</p><p>Qin Sang humbly bowed to the assembled Yuan Ying cultivators. They returned the courtesy, and true introductions were made.</p><p>His seat was next to Qing Jun.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the haphazard seating arrangement. Daoist Zhenyi, likely unprepared for the sudden rise of Qin Sang and Qing Jun, had avoided assigning seats according to rank to prevent potential conflict.</p><p>This disappointed some onlookers. They were eager to witness a confrontation between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, but both were too shrewd to show their hand. A seating dispute that escalated into a fight would have been quite the spectacle.</p><p>Once everyone arrived, Daoist Zhenyi sealed the Ice Crystal Palace’s protective barriers, his expression serious as he addressed the matter at hand.</p><p>“Elder Ye and Tianzheng suffered heavy injuries. But with Daoist Leng and Daoist Qin as reinforcements, the time for a counterattack is ripe. Daoist Tongyou and I have investigated; Zu Yuan is consolidating forces and shows signs of retreat. We cannot let them withdraw so easily! Our army will be divided into three groups. Daoist Jinjia and I will lead one, Daoist Tongyou and Dongyang will lead another, and Daoist Leng and Daoist Qin will lead the third…”</p><p>The counterattack plan had already been agreed upon, so Daoist Zhenyi proceeded directly to the deployment.  Each of the three leaders commanded forces among the strongest in the two realms, making the arrangement undeniable.</p><p>“I have contacted cultivators in the desert; they will fully support us, diverting Zu Yuan's forces. With our three armies advancing simultaneously, we will drive Zu Yuan back to Tianhen!  Daoist Chifa was ambushed and critically wounded by Elder Ye, ultimately succumbing to a Heavenly Tribulation. This decisive battle is for his revenge—we will make Zu Yuan pay a bloody price!”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi slammed his hand on the table, his voice booming.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators were invigorated.  Years of being suppressed by Zu Yuan were finally about to end.</p><p>When Daoist Zhenyi mentioned Ancestor Chifa, a man and a woman among the Yuan Ying cultivators exchanged a look, then both coldly snorted, their faces filled with aversion.  They were Ancestor Chifa’s two successors. After his fall, their discord led to the split of the Pure Yang Sect, the largest sect in Xiao Han Domain. Every encounter resulted in the same icy hostility.</p><p>At this point, someone noted that Daoist Zhenyi hadn’t mentioned the demon clan.</p><p>“Daoist Zhenyi, have you contacted the Feather Demon King? What are the plans of the Heavenly Demon Mound?”</p>
