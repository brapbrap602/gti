<h1>Chapter 749: The Purple Mist Dead Zone</h1><p>The group continued their journey, following the Purple River upstream.</p><p>They drew closer to the Purple Mist Dead Zone, even able to vaguely see purple lights shimmering deep within the dark forest.</p><p>Then, Xiang Yi, who was at the forefront, suddenly waved his hand, his expression turning grave as he stared at the Purple River.</p><p>The others were startled and stopped in unison.</p><p>The next moment, huge waves suddenly splashed up from the center of the river, and a dark shadow leaped out of the water. Before they could make out its features, it vanished right before their eyes.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Quick, get out of the way!”</p><p>…</p><p>The group cried out in alarm, scattering instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body glowed red, and he was about to activate a talisman to retreat when a feeling of foreboding washed over him. Without hesitation, he patted the corpse puppet pouch at his waist, and the Flying Night Rakshasa appeared.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A muffled sound echoed.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa was sent flying, crashing heavily into a tree.</p><p>Its煞气 dissipated, its chest deeply dented. Fortunately, the Rakshasa’s physical body was robust, preventing it from being shattered by the blow.</p><p>If it had been anyone else present, they likely wouldn’t have fared so well.</p><p>After the Flying Night Rakshasa was knocked away, the creature revealed itself to be a strange fish.  It resembled a crocodile in shape, but its limbs and tail seemed to be stitched together from various demonic beasts, giving it a ferocious appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape, rushing to the Flying Night Rakshasa’s side to check its injuries. He discovered that the Rakshasa’s chest had been pierced.</p><p>Cui Ji cast a gleeful glance.</p><p>However, because the vital organs were not injured, the wound, while looking terrible, had little effect on the Flying Night Rakshasa; it could recover quickly by absorbing earth煞 energy.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang encountered danger, his first reaction was to flee, or to use his ebony sword or the Flying Night Rakshasa. The creatures in this forest were unprecedented, possessing incredibly strange abilities. Even with his Golden Light Armor, he didn't want to let them touch him.</p><p>Against this fish from the Purple River, his sachet proved useless.</p><p>He was quite frustrated. The reason for the creature's sneak attack was simple: out of the eight people, only he and Madam Liu had the lowest cultivation.  Madam Liu had someone protecting her closely, so the target was obvious.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned at the fish, suddenly remembering something.  “No good!  It’s a Purple River Crocodile! Kill it!”</p><p>The group was startled, but seeing Xiang Yi’s urgent expression, they didn’t dare delay, and quickly summoned their magical treasures.</p><p>For a moment, the colorful lights of their magical treasures bombarded the same target.</p><p>Qin Sang was not to be outdone, unleashing his sword energy and thunder, avenging the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The Purple River Crocodile turned to flee.  Its bulky body was surprisingly agile.  As it escaped, it opened its mouth and let out a piercing shriek.</p><p>The shriek was sharp and pierced their eardrums.</p><p>The moment it finished screaming, the Purple River Crocodile was struck by the ebony sword, followed immediately by two more magical treasure attacks. Although the combined attacks hit the crocodile, they failed to kill it, allowing its shriek to carry on.</p><p>As the group prepared to attack again, Xiang Yi stopped them.</p><p>He stared intently at the depths of the forest, allowing the Purple River Crocodile to escape back into the river.  With questioning gazes upon him, he said in a low voice, “The Purple River Crocodile’s cry can summon nearby ferocious beasts.  Go! Into the Purple Mist Dead Zone!”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the group sensed something amiss in the depths of the forest.</p><p>The strange cries were even more urgent than before, with countless dark shadows rushing towards them.</p><p>At this sight, the group’s scalps tingled. Without Xiang Yi’s urging, they immediately put away their magical treasures and fled with him.</p><p>This was where the difference in escape techniques became apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang, using only the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, was able to keep pace with Xiang Yi, who had the fastest escape speed, drawing everyone's attention.</p><p>Following closely behind them were the Liu couple and the young man with the sword. The young man had independently cultivated sword energy and thunder; he had watched Qin Sang intently when Qin Sang used the ebony sword earlier.</p><p>Then came Cui Ji, the richly dressed fat man, and the cultivator with the Pan surname. The three of them had similar speeds, lagging behind.  The Pan cultivator appeared the most relaxed, seemingly not using his full strength.</p><p>Behind them, the beasts were swarming.</p><p>The group fled in disarray, but fortunately, they were not far from the Purple Mist Dead Zone. Soon, they saw a boundless expanse of purple mist ahead.</p><p>The purple mist blotted out the sun, shrouding the entire forest.</p><p>Arriving at the edge, everyone smelled a sweet fragrance, followed by a stinging sensation on their skin.  </p><p>Even before entering, they felt a corrosive effect and quickly activated their protective energy.</p><p>The monstrous beasts drew closer, thundering through the jungle with astonishing force, like muffled thunder.</p><p>Xiang Yi landed, swiftly retrieving a lotus-shaped treasure from his pouch.  Upon closer inspection, it wasn't actually refined metal; it possessed a pale glow, revealing it to be carved from some kind of bone.</p><p>The lotus treasure was initially closed.</p><p>He infused it with energy.  The lotus slowly bloomed, eventually reaching the size of a hand, each petal radiating a brilliant light.  These lights converged, forming a large protective shield.</p><p>The purple mist, upon contact with the shield, recoiled, creating a safe zone easily accommodating all eight of them.</p><p>"Come in!"</p><p>Xiang Yi beckoned.</p><p>Approaching, they deactivated their protective energy and found their skin no longer burned. The treasure truly repelled the poisonous mist.</p><p>Under the lotus treasure's protection, they quickly entered the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>Holding their breath, they listened intently. Soon, the thundering behind them ceased. Monstrous beasts howled outside but dared not enter.</p><p>"My mistake,"</p><p>Xiang Yi explained,  "Purple River Crocodiles are extremely rare. I assumed our large group would deter them... Thankfully, Daoist Qingfeng's abilities are exceptional."</p><p>Cui Ji sneered, "That demon cultivator has been using that Yaksha as a showpiece for twenty years, and still hasn't improved."</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Liu shook his head.  "That's not fair.  I believe the Daoist's Yaksha is no ordinary one, its physical strength is formidable. That blow must have been a superficial wound.  Even in my mid-stage cultivation, I wouldn't easily overcome it. The Daoist's greatest strength is his escape techniques, which I can only admire. I hope we can spar sometime."</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded in agreement. "It looks like a treasure refined from a condensed dragon soul, yet it seems to possess the power of a spirit talisman; it's quite strange…"</p><p>"Escape techniques are mere trifles, my apologies for the display,"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, naturally avoiding revealing the secrets of his Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>They didn't probe further into his secrets and refrained from asking questions.</p><p>Cui Ji was secretly annoyed but said nothing.</p><p>…</p><p>The beasts outside gradually dispersed.</p><p>Everyone surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>The ancient trees within the Purple Mist Wasteland were noticeably sparser, their bark tinged purple.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang suddenly looked down at the lotus in Xiang Yi's hand, pointing to a petal and questioning, "Xiang Daoist, is this treasure also being affected by the purple mist?"</p><p>Everyone looked closely and indeed saw that one petal, originally a pure pale white, now had an eerie pink tinge.</p>
