<h1>Chapter 670: Calming the Storm</h1><p>The domesticated beasts, possessing immense strength and rudimentary spellcasting abilities, traveled day and night, propelling the caravan forward at a pace far exceeding expectations.</p><p>By the second day, Qin Sang had become acquainted with his two fellow passengers.  Ran Luo, though sharing the same carriage, was preoccupied with her duties, assisting Elder Zou in managing the caravan, and rarely appeared.</p><p>The two passengers were a man and a woman, both at the early stage of Core Formation. They seemed unfazed by Qin Sang's unusual attire, asking no questions.</p><p>The man, Ning Kun, like Ran Luo, was a steward of the瓊宇 Trading Company. However, after boarding, Qin Sang noticed that despite his high cultivation level, Ning Kun seemed to be suffering from some internal injury.  Qin Sang later learned that Ning Kun had recently arrived at  Harbor after escorting a trading vessel. During the voyage, they had encountered a disruptive attack by sea beasts. Ning Kun fought fiercely, protecting the vessel and ensuring its escape, but sustained significant injuries in the process.  He had intended to recuperate at Harbor, but circumstances forced him to travel while still wounded.</p><p>The female cultivator, a Daoist nun known as Hui Wen, was not affiliated with the 瓊宇 Trading Company. However, she and Ran Luo were old family friends and, at Ran Luo's invitation, were traveling together.</p><p>"Thank goodness Elder Zou returned and sensed something amiss with the Wu Clan. Otherwise, we would've been caught completely unaware. Now it all makes sense why several prominent human factions have been leaving Harbor over the past few months. We thought it was a coincidence, but it turns out they received prior warning," Hui Wen exclaimed, patting her chest with a look of naive alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that cultivators of their level were far from simple-minded and wouldn't be fooled by her outward appearance. Turning to Ning Kun, he inquired, "Your company is part of the East Pole Alliance. How did you not receive any information?"</p><p>The more factions Qin Sang interacted with at Harbor, the more he understood the East Pole Alliance's influence. This vast trading alliance held a position among the human race comparable to even the most prestigious sects.  Qin Sang found it hard to believe that the East Pole Alliance had remained oblivious to the Wu Clan's unusual activities.</p><p>Ning Kun's face, still pale, betrayed his weakened state.  "Our company's focus has always been on the Eastern Sea within human territory," he said weakly. "Our branch at Harbor doesn't have deep roots.  Elder Zou recently befriended the Island Lord of Stone Cliff Island in the Stormy Demon Sea. Stone Cliff Island is closer to the Wu Clan's Sky Witch Island, and we were planning to open up a route there. We didn't expect this to happen. As for the East Pole Alliance... it's not a unified entity..." </p><p>Ning Kun trailed off, shaking his head with an expression that suggested the matter was best left undiscussed.</p><p>Qin Sang had already learned that the human and Wu Clan strongholds in the Demon Sea were not in the same location. The Wu Clan occupied an island known as Sky Witch Island, while humans were transported to an island called Great Wilderness Island. The two islands were separated by a vast distance, a route painstakingly established by both sides. Between Sky Witch Island and Great Wilderness Island, human and Wu Clan experts jointly guarded several islands, forming a sea route and serving as a base of operations against the sea beasts. Cultivators entering the Demon Sea to hunt also relied on these islands.</p><p>The areas occupied by humans and the Wu Clan were merely a small fraction of the vast Demon Sea. Aside from Sky Witch Island and Great Wilderness Island, none of the islands could guarantee absolute safety. Tragedies of islands being overrun by beast tides and their inhabitants perished were not uncommon. However, Sky Witch Island and Great Wilderness Island had been established for a long time, and the surrounding sea beasts had been largely cleared. For substantial gains, cultivators had to venture to other, more dangerous islands.</p><p>Judging by Ning Kun's tone, Stone Cliff Island was likely one of the major islands along the sea route. These large islands possessed formidable strength, their lords often being Nascent Soul Patriarchs.  To befriend the Island Lord of Stone Cliff Island suggested that Elder Zou was no ordinary person.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. Joining the 瓊宇 Trading Company seemed like an increasingly appealing prospect.</p><p>"I see," Qin Sang nodded, then shifted the conversation. "Do you have any thoughts on the Wu Clan's recent activities?  Could it be related to the recent Seven Slaughter Palace incident? I've heard rumors in Harbor that several powerful factions with Nascent Soul Patriarchs have been involved."</p><p>His primary concern was the Seven Slaughter Palace, but his inquiries in Harbor had yielded little. Hearing that Ning Kun had recently arrived from human territories, he steered the conversation in that direction.</p><p>Unsuspecting, Ning Kun shook his head. "I don't think so. The appearance of the ancient corpse in the Seven Slaughter Palace isn't a secret. It was widely discussed a while ago, and the details are quite clear.  Wu Clan experts can't enter the Seven Slaughter Palace; it's a human secret realm, unrelated to the Wu Clan.  Besides, the Wu Clan's unusual activities reportedly began around the time the Seven Slaughter Palace opened, though it wasn't taken seriously at first. Moreover, if there was a connection, wouldn't the Wu Clan's Nascent Soul Patriarchs have revealed themselves by now, considering the situation among humans has calmed down?"</p><p>"Calmed down?" Qin Sang was taken aback. "Has the ancient corpse been found?"</p><p>"Probably," Ning Kun replied uncertainly. "It's said that the corpse carries a valuable treasure from the Seven Slaughter Palace, something even Nascent Soul Patriarchs would covet.  They wouldn't give up so easily unless they found it.  Oh, right! I heard that the righteous and demonic paths clashed several times in their search for the corpse, nearly igniting a full-scale war that would've impacted many factions.  Perhaps to prevent internal strife, the higher-ups suppressed the conflict and continued the search discreetly."</p><p>"That makes sense."  Qin Sang nodded, finding Ning Kun's speculation plausible.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, although human factions held the upper hand, confining the Wu Clan to the Wu God Continent, the Wu Clan was not to be underestimated, possessing numerous Nascent Soul Patriarchs and posing a constant threat.  Any unrest among humans could be exploited by the Wu Clan, something the human leadership would never allow.</p><p>He was still alive and well, and no one had found him.  The Celestial Tower was heavily fortified, shrouded in immortal clouds. The scene within the crystal showed that the ancient corpse had appeared only briefly.  The nearest Nascent Soul Patriarchs had barely arrived when it vanished, making it impossible for them to discern his true identity.</p><p>Hui Wen, bored from listening to their conversation, interjected, "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, I don't believe we've met before. Sister Ran Luo invited you to share our carriage. What's your relationship? Does she have secrets I don't know about?" she teased, winking at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang found this Daoist nun rather unconventional, referring to herself as "this concubine" instead of "this poor nun."</p><p>Ning Kun seemed to be aware of the situation.  "Steward Ran highly praises Fellow Daoist Qing Feng's artifact refinement skills. I, too, look forward to the day you become an overseas guest elder of the 瓊宇 Trading Company."</p><p>"Artifact refinement skills?" Hui Wen exclaimed in surprise. "Fellow Daoist, can you forge magical treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly. "You both overestimate me. My artifact refinement skills are yet to be judged by Elder Zou. I'm only slightly more proficient in crafting magical instruments than others. Due to my insufficient cultivation, I haven't yet forged any magical treasures."</p>
