<h1>Chapter 385: Until We Meet Again</h1><p>This Flying Yaksha, corresponding to the description in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, was indeed transformed from a Qi Condensation stage living corpse. </p><p>The sudden pause of the ghostly hand just now was Qin Sang attempting to influence its movements through the Corpse Control Talisman.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha is equivalent to a Gold Core level corpse refinement.</p><p>Of course, a Flying Yaksha's strength is certainly inferior to a true Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* uses Qi Condensation cultivators to forcibly elevate them into Flying Yakshas, resulting in inherent deficiencies.</p><p>But it can definitely suppress Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The previous clash also demonstrated this point. Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's combined sword attack was easily shattered by the Flying Yaksha's single punch. The difference in strength was too great.</p><p>Although they were prepared, their escape was still fraught with danger. They narrowly avoided being knocked off their flying boat several times in the passage by the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>Facing a corpse refinement of this level, Qin Sang wasn't sure if the Corpse Control Talisman could still influence it.</p><p>After testing, Qin Sang discovered that when he fully channeled his divine sense to control the Corpse Control Talisman, he could indeed hinder the Flying Yaksha's movements slightly.</p><p>Although this influence was very limited, and Qin Sang couldn't use it continuously, it was a clever tactic in fierce combat and had a significant effect.</p><p>When the Spirit Bamboo flying boat landed in a safe place, the Flying Yaksha didn't pursue them.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked expectant, not daring to disturb Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang had a plan. "Senior, this individual does seem to be related to the secret technique I've mastered, and it can be influenced, but I still need to test a few more times..."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Yun Youzi completely trusted Qin Sang and naturally had no objections. The two adjusted their breath slightly and returned to the entrance of the ice hall.</p><p>After several tests, Qin Sang understood the Flying Yaksha better.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha's most renowned ability was its mastery of the Five Elements Escape Technique, making it incredibly elusive. However, because of the Corpse Control Talisman, Qin Sang could detect the Flying Yaksha's movements when it approached him.</p><p>Furthermore, its physical body was extremely tough and resilient, with a powerful regenerative ability.</p><p>The Ebony Sword could only leave minor cuts on its body, which were instantly healed by the surging Earthly Yin Qi. Qin Sang couldn't possibly exhaust the Flying Yaksha's Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>However, his goal wasn't to kill the Flying Yaksha, so these weren't major concerns.</p><p>The most terrifying aspect was the corpse poison on the Flying Yaksha. Qin Sang was determined not to be injured by it.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally rehearsed countless times and felt he could delay it for fifteen breaths, but trying to bypass the Flying Yaksha and enter the side chamber to search for the corpse and relics would be suicidal.</p><p>The side chamber where the Flying Yaksha resided was in the deepest part of the ice hall, and its depth was unknown.</p><p>Over such a long distance, Qin Sang couldn't possibly resist the Flying Yaksha while using the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman to escape. Even if he could rush in, he would be trapped and killed by the Flying Yaksha inside the ice hall.</p><p>Unless he thought of another way...</p><p>Qin Sang immediately thought of the two remaining refined corpses in his Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>One Malignant Corpse and one Living Corpse.</p><p>Within a certain range, he could use his soul imprint to sense the surroundings through the refined corpses, allowing them to enter as his scapegoats.</p><p>However, this would undoubtedly result in the death of the refined corpses, with no chance of escaping the Flying Yaksha's clutches.</p><p>The Malignant Corpse was expendable, but Living Corpses were difficult to refine, and the loss of even one was painful.</p><p>This was equivalent to gambling with precious refined corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate for too long. There were gains to be made from sacrifices, and obtaining the secret technique to refine a Flying Yaksha was worth the loss of a Living Corpse.</p><p>Returning here wasn't easy; Yun Youzi's preparations were incredibly complex, and Qin Sang wasn't confident he could replicate them.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang nodded to Yun Youzi, signaling his readiness.</p><p>Yun Youzi, usually resolute, seemed uneasy at this moment. He cupped his hands and said gravely, "Brother Qin, I've left a message with my sect. If I don't return, please take this token to the Taiyi Pill Sect. I'll bequeath a few of my belongings to you as a token of my gratitude. I hope you won't mind... My future rests in your hands!"</p><p>"Rest assured, Senior, I will do my utmost!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn, suddenly feeling immense pressure on his shoulders.</p><p>Yun Youzi turned, gazing at the end of the passage and the silent ice hall. It resembled the gaping maw of a beast, waiting to devour any intruders.</p><p>Lost in thought, Yun Youzi stood there for a moment, then suddenly revealed a relieved smile. He raised his palm, and the Flawless Pearl flew out, emitting a bright light.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed the surge of demonic energy from the Flawless Pearl, wondering if this peculiar artifact had other abilities.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's curiosity, Yun Youzi explained, "The Nine Flowers Greenfrost Grass isn't entirely useless. My increased cultivation allows me to utilize more of the Flawless Pearl's abilities. With the Flawless Pearl and these artifacts, I should be able to conceal my presence from that monster for a short time."</p><p>As he spoke, Yun Youzi took out two silver, cone-shaped artifacts.</p><p>"Brother Qin, I'll go first! Until we meet again!"</p><p>Before his voice faded, Yun Youzi vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang counted the time silently. After a moment, Yin Qi surged in his palm, and ten ghostly banners slowly materialized.</p><p>As Qin Sang's hand seals changed, the Ten Yama Banners unfurled, spinning rapidly around him with a mournful wail, eventually forming a formation. Qin Sang gathered them before him, ready to deploy them at any moment.</p><p>Trapping the Flying Yaksha required the Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang had already tested it in the Corpse Cave. The Yin Soul Threads were incredibly effective against living corpses. Now, with all ten Yama Banners assembled, the formation's power had greatly increased, making it even more effective.</p><p>This formation, along with the Corpse Control Talisman, was the source of Qin Sang's confidence.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang patted his Corpse Puppet Pouch, and the Malignant Corpse and Living Corpse stood behind him, following closely.</p><p>They were fragile before the Flying Yaksha. Qin Sang didn't intend to use them to entangle it, but rather to send them in to search for the Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivator's remains and relics when the opportunity arose.</p><p>After Qin Sang set up the Ten Yama Formation, the area ahead remained silent.</p><p>This time was enough for Yun Youzi to infiltrate the ice hall and enter the side chamber to make preparations.  Evidently, Yun Youzi's methods were working; the Flying Yaksha hadn't detected him.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Sang pushed off the ground and dashed towards the ice hall without hesitation, arriving at the entrance in a few flashes.</p><p>Before he could steady himself, Qin Sang's expression hardened, and a sense of alarm surged within him. He couldn't see through the Flying Yaksha's escape technique, but he could sense its presence through the faint aura of the Corpse Control Talisman. It was extremely close.</p><p>He deliberately made noise to attract the Flying Yaksha, and it worked.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly roared, informing Yun Youzi that he had encountered the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>They had to act together, every second counted!</p>
