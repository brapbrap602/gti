第一千四百五十六章 Faithless Man (4k, Two-in-One)

"I'll negotiate with him, and we'll make a decision after the Grand Elder returns,"
Elder Lan said after pondering for a short while.
After a pause, she explained a few more things.
"That person had several opportunities to kill Shi Xue, but he didn't, probably because he guessed why we were blocking him—to capture him alive and find out the origin of the Sacred Object.
"Although he was eventually startled away by Old Devil Hunmo, he clearly held back, indicating that he doesn't want to forge an irreconcilable feud with Profound Heaven Palace unless absolutely necessary. At least, he's not like someone from the Demonic Path, acting without any regard (being unscrupulous).
"His cultivation is only in the Middle Core Formation stage. As long as he understands that the seal cannot be opened and holding it in his hands is more harmful than beneficial, he might actively contact us; it will just be a transaction.
"Unless absolutely necessary, there's no need to cooperate with Old Devil Hunmo and provoke such a top expert. Not only will we be used by Old Devil Hunmo to deal with his enemies, but we'll also be inviting a wolf into our house.
"Of course, we can feign cooperation with Old Devil Hunmo to create a false front, putting pressure on that person, but we must prevent Old Devil Hunmo from turning the tables and becoming the dominant party. The balance here is difficult to grasp; this is a major matter and requires the Grand Elder to decide.
"This concerns the Sacred Object, and we must not bungle it."
Witnessing the battle between Old Devil Hunmo and Qin Sang, Elder Lan saw that there was no room for her to completely intervene (directly), and she quickly sorted out the situation in her mind, thinking of all possible developments and weighing the pros and cons.
Mainly, it was Qin Sang's words before he left; on the surface, it was a warning, but Elder Lan heard a bit of a hidden meaning.
Elder Mei nodded, agreeing with Elder Lan's idea.
Before, when the Sacred Object's whereabouts were unknown, their biggest concern was that a traitor would succeed, so they risked cooperating with Old Devil Hunmo.
Now that they've confirmed that the Sacred Object isn't with the traitor and hasn't fallen into the hands of Great Sage Nine-Heads, they don't need to worry about the seal being broken or the Sacred Object being lost in the short term. They can completely plan calmly.
They've always been wary of Old Devil Hunmo.
The cooperation before the Myriad Devil Assembly was already very risky. During the battle just now, Old Devil Hunmo was lurking nearby without them knowing, hiding and not acting, clearly having designs.
Elder Mei looked back, sent a signal, and summoned all Core Formation cultivators and members of the Enforcement Hall.
Elder Lan carefully considered her words, steadied her mind, took a few steps forward, and greeted Old Devil Hunmo.
…
Night fell.
On the calm sea, a deserted island stood quietly.
A slightly illusory figure suddenly appeared on the shore, looked around, and flashed into the jungle, traversing through the forest without disturbing any insects or beasts.
Silently, this figure stopped in front of an ancient tree that dozens of people could encircle, waved his hand, and sent spiritual flags into the ground, disappearing together with the ancient tree and the figure out of thin air.
"Hoo…"
Qin Sang entered the tree cave, sat down cross-legged, and exhaled a long breath.
After shaking off Old Devil Hunmo, Qin Sang didn't go to the Dan Ding Society, but changed direction, flew for a while longer, and found this inconspicuous deserted island.
"I'll make a trip later; Real Person Yin Quan shouldn't have left yet. I'll ask them to stay for another day."
Qin Sang muttered.
Immediately, Qin Sang remembered the end of the chase and kill just now and smiled wryly, "I didn't expect Old Devil Hunmo to be startled away by the Great Sage Tianpeng in the end. To use the Lightning Escape Technique, I need to use the Transformation of the Heavenly Demon. It's impossible to focus on concealing my demonic aura while flying at full speed. Perhaps the Great Sage Tianpeng was attracted by the demonic aura. As I expected, the more chaotic the situation, the more beneficial it is to me, but this is too chaotic. Sure enough, plans can't keep up with changes…"
Qin Sang rubbed his forehead with a headache, closing his eyes to recall the course and details of this chaotic battle.
According to the original plan, testing whether Profound Heaven Palace could sense the Mysterious Ice Box, and the range of the sensing, would be enough to achieve his goal.
Unexpectedly, he discovered that the strength of the Profound Heaven Palace's personnel was not strong enough, so Qin Sang had the idea of capturing the woman in green, which led to a series of changes.
"That's not right! The behavior of Old Devil Hunmo and Profound Heaven Palace doesn't seem like they have an irreconcilable feud."
Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes flashing with divine light, flickering uncertainly.
If, as rumored, several Core Formation cultivators had been slaughtered by Old Devil Hunmo, even with Profound Heaven Palace's great tolerance, their reaction to seeing Old Devil Hunmo shouldn't have been like this.
Moreover, the Core Formation cultivators of Profound Heaven Palace were clearly occupying each side, surrounding Hunmo Island. Acting so ostentatiously and dispersing their strength was clearly akin to wishing for death.
Qin Sang turned his palm and took out the Mysterious Ice Box, holding it in his hand.
He couldn't open the seal, but that didn't mean that traitor couldn't.
After staring at it for a long time, Qin Sang thought for a long time, then muttered in a deep voice, "Profound Heaven Palace is worried about the seal being broken and colluding with Old Devil Hunmo to set up a scheme, pushing the Myriad Devil Assembly forward to attract the traitor to appear? But how can they ensure that Old Devil Hunmo won't become greedy?"
'Tap, tap, tap...'
Qin Sang tapped the Ice Box lightly with his finger, "Unless there's a powerful expert that Old Devil Hunmo fears, either the Palace Lord of Profound Heaven Palace has personally arrived, or there's still a mysterious expert hidden. I don't know why, but that person hasn't shown up."
He believed that this was the most reasonable explanation.
Otherwise, if Old Devil Hunmo had malicious intentions, these people would have a hard time restricting him.
"Profound Heaven Palace has a deep foundation; besides the Palace Lord, there are also experts unknown to the outside world. There's nothing wrong with my plan and choices; the root cause is incorrect intelligence. It led to me being forced to face Old Devil Hunmo directly, using demonic fire to fight him, leading him into the Lost Trace Formation, thus exposing my identity."
Qin Sang sighed, but he wasn't afraid.
This battle forced out Old Devil Hunmo's Body Shifting Divine Power, which was a considerable gain, preventing him from being schemed against by Old Devil Hunmo's divine power and causing greater losses in the future.
The problem now is how deep the cooperation between Profound Heaven Palace and Old Devil Hunmo is, and whether there's a possibility that they will continue to join forces to chase him down.
Qin Sang's mind flashed through scene after scene.
Those were the expressions of shock and vigilance on the faces of the people from Profound Heaven Palace when Old Devil Hunmo appeared; it wasn't an act.
"They're just distrustful of each other!"
Qin Sang chuckled softly, looking at the Mysterious Ice Box with a relaxed expression.
Then, he spread out his other palm, with the Ice Pearl that Chen Yan had secretly sent him in his palm.
In that situation, Chen Yan actually took the initiative to communicate with him, proposing to meet him alone and sending the Ice Pearl, whose effect was to temporarily suppress the fluctuations of the Mysterious Ice Box.
He placed the Ice Pearl and the Mysterious Ice Box together.
Qin Sang was a little hesitant, suspecting that Chen Yan might not have been completely powerless to fight back when he was withdrawing, and may have been feigning. Of course, if he had insisted on capturing the woman in green, Chen Yan would definitely have attacked.
He couldn't guess Chen Yan's intentions and didn't think that their previous entanglements could make Chen Yan go to this extent.
"Could it be that she also wants to be a thief within the family, plotting for the treasure in the Mysterious Ice Box?"
Qin Sang thought of a possibility and felt a little sorry for Profound Heaven Palace.
On second thought, before reaching Core Formation, Chen Yan had been cultivating in Shao Hua Mountain. She only returned to Profound Heaven Palace after reaching Core Formation, so she probably didn't have much affection for her sect.
The only question is what conditions she can offer?
Qin Sang thought about it, deciding to wait and see what Chen Yan's purpose was, and to use her to find out what exactly was sealed inside.
He activated his true essence, wrapped the Ice Pearl, carefully sensed it, and confirmed that there was no problem.
Then, he laid down several layers of isolation restrictions around it before activating the power in the Ice Pearl.
The Ice Pearl melted, turning into a cloud of white mist.
The next moment, Qin Sang felt a burst of extreme cold aura being released. In an instant, the true essence that came into contact with the Ice Pearl seemed to be frozen, surprising him.
He carefully guided a trace of extreme cold aura, approaching the Mysterious Ice Box.
Finally, Qin Sang confirmed that this aura wouldn't cause any changes in the seal before continuing with the next steps.
'Hoo!'
The white mist enveloped the Mysterious Ice Box, and wisps of aura seeped into the seal.
Throughout this process, Qin Sang focused on the Mysterious Ice Box.
The white mist emitted a special fluctuation, and under the influence of the white mist, the seal underwent changes that Qin Sang had never seen before, with a feeling that the seal was gradually solidifying.
This was something that Qin Sang had never been able to do with countless methods.
Eventually, the white mist on the surface of the Mysterious Ice Box disappeared, and the Ice Box itself had no significant changes.
Qin Sang focused his mind and sensed that, with the impact of the white mist, he vaguely discerned the special nature of the seal, confirming that the Ice Pearl could suppress the seal, but he couldn't replicate this strange treasure, and he didn't know how to use it correctly.
The suppression wasn't complete; if someone from Profound Heaven Palace came outside the tree cave, they could still sense the Mysterious Ice Box, but the range would be limited, and the impact wouldn't be significant.
In addition, the seal was constantly resisting, and it would recover when the power of the Ice Pearl was exhausted.
He held it in his hand and looked at it for a long time.
Qin Sang put the Mysterious Ice Box into the Qian Jun Ring, took out spiritual pills and spirit stones, and adjusted his breathing to recover.
Not long after, Qin Sang flew out of the deserted island, identified the direction, and flew away.
…
Southwest of Hunmo Island, there was a cluster of islands.
Dozens of islands, large and small, were scattered in this sea area.
The spiritual energy around the islands was barren, so only mortals lived there. Mortals occupied several of the larger islands, and there were many cities on the islands, which were considered prosperous.
Qin Sang quietly appeared above a city, holding the Dan Ding Order in his hand. After observing for a while, he quietly infiltrated the city and came to a shop.
Just as he landed, the door opened silently, and Real Person Yin Quan's voice came out, "Fellow Daoist Qin, please come in!"
Qin Sang paused, then stepped inside.
"Is this also your society's property? Fellow Daoist's fallback isn't on this island, right?"
Qin Sang looked around and looked at Real Person Yin Quan, who came out to greet him.
"The Dan Ding Society's foundation in the Boundless Sea is weak, so it's inconvenient to be high-profile. Mortals are easy to hide, sometimes more useful than cultivators. The real arrangements aren't here, to avoid harming innocent people. I didn't receive any warning from Fellow Daoist Qin, so I brought everyone back after the agreed time," Real Person Yin Quan explained.
As he spoke, Real Person Yin Quan looked Qin Sang up and down, "Fellow Daoist Qin, did you encounter anything?"
Qin Sang asked rhetorically without changing his expression, "Real Person seems to have something to say?"
Seeing that Qin Sang's aura was intact and unharmed, Real Person Yin Quan nodded secretly and said frankly, "I just received a message that a mysterious expert offended Old Devil Hunmo for some reason and was chased for thousands of miles, but managed to escape successfully. I was just thinking, could this mysterious expert be Fellow Daoist Qin? Fellow Daoist Luan and the others haven't left yet and want to pay their respects to Fellow Daoist Qin. I felt that if it was really Fellow Daoist Qin who did it, you probably wouldn't want to see outsiders at this time, so I settled them elsewhere."
Qin Sang's heart moved upon hearing this.
The Dan Ding Society's information was well-informed, but they only found out about the chase.
It didn't take too long from when he attacked Profound Heaven Palace to when he used the Lost Trace Formation to trap Old Devil Hunmo. There probably weren't many people who saw the whole process and understood what happened.
What really caused a sensation was the chase that followed.
It depends on whether Profound Heaven Palace and Old Devil Hunmo will actively spread it.
"Even if I had greater abilities, I wouldn't dare provoke that old devil. If Real Person finds out the identity of that expert in the future, don't forget to introduce him to me," Qin Sang shook his head and smiled.
Real Person Yin Quan glanced at him and said with a chuckle, "Indeed, I was thinking too much."
Qin Sang didn't care whether he believed it or not, and didn't say much more, taking out the jade slip that recorded the ancient recipe.
"This…"
Real Person Yin Quan looked at Qin Sang in surprise when he saw the reward that far exceeded the agreement.
Qin Sang said, "Qin has another transaction that hasn't been completed and would like to ask Real Person to stay for another day. We'll still follow the previous agreement; the remaining ancient recipe is the reward for this time. If I need Real Person and Fellow Daoist Luan to take action, there will be another great reward! Real Person can rest assured that the person Qin is trading with isn't Old Devil Hunmo."
Real Person Yin Quan hesitated for a while, then grasped the jade slip, "Alright, I was just preparing to play chess with Fellow Daoist Luan all night; I haven't had enough yet."
Qin Sang didn't expect Real Person Yin Quan to already suspect him, but still agree so readily.
Could it be that the Sect Master of Dan Ding Mountain is nearby?
Or are they confident enough in their arrangements for him?
After exchanging a few words with Real Person Yin Quan, Qin Sang took his leave.
…
Southeast of Hunmo Island, on an island that wasn't controlled by Old Devil Hunmo, there was a large city of cultivators.
Liu Li sat cross-legged in a quiet room, her eyes closed tightly, still as a virgin.
The quiet room was filled with cold air, but her face was flushed, and her eyelids were trembling, as if she was enduring some kind of pain. It took a while for her to gradually return to normal.
At this time, the restrictions in the quiet room were triggered, and Liu Li woke up from her meditation, seeing her senior sister walking in.
Shi Xue saw the inquiring look in Liu Li's eyes and knew that this junior sister had always been taciturn. She said angrily, "The elders have already decided not to divide their forces for the time being, to avoid repeating the same mistakes. We'll first feign compliance with Old Devil Hunmo, and then make a decision after the Grand Elder returns. They said that guy had been showing mercy to me and leaving me room to maneuver, but why didn't I feel it! My Frostwinter Talisman, my two life-saving treasures… According to this, I should thank him?"
The more Shi Xue spoke, the angrier she became, her eyebrows standing on end.
Liu Li was silent for a moment, then said, "The sect will compensate us."
"I hope the Grand Elder can vent my anger!"
Shi Xue lowered her head, knowing that it was impossible for her to take revenge herself, and sighed weakly.
She raised her eyes, looked at Liu Li, hesitated for a moment, closed the quiet room, and sealed it with a soundproof restriction, "Junior Sister, do you have anything to say to me?"
Chen Yan was stunned.
Shi Xue stared into her eyes and said seriously, "Junior Sister, you can hide it from others, but you can't hide it from me. Your Ice Soul Divine Light is about to be completed; it's impossible for it to collapse so easily!"
Seeing Chen Yan remain silent, Shi Xue suddenly raised her voice, "I know that you're cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light to use the Ice Soul to seal your emotions, cut off your love affair, and stabilize your Dao Heart! Only a violent fluctuation in your Dao Heart, shaking your foundation, can cause the Ice Soul Divine Light to collapse! Before I saw you, Junior Sister, I always thought that the love between men and women was just a shackle that those short-sighted, ignorant people put on themselves. I never thought that a Core Formation cultivator would also be troubled by love!"
"He… is that faithless man?"
Shi Xue looked at Chen Yan with a distressed expression, thinking of that hateful figure, gritting her teeth, new and old hatred涌上心头 (all rushing to her heart).
