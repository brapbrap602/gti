<h1>Chapter 204: Gubei Town</h1><p>Gubei Town.</p><p>In the northernmost area of the Immortal Battlefield's outer district, Gubei Town was the demarcation between the outer and middle districts. One must pass through Gubei Town in order to enter the middle district; thus, it can be described as the boundary marker between the two districts.</p><p>Along the journey from Xuanluan Pass to Gubei Town, Qin Sang encountered a fair number of towns and trade centers. This is the safest path one can take to enter the battlefield.</p><p>Further north from Gubei Town, there are very few places that are safe.</p><p>In the middle district, the natural phenomena are much more frightening. Groups of cloud beasts lurk there with formidable powers. Most importantly, the damaged secret realm's 禁制 (restrictions) are unable to hold on for much longer. Aside from a few perilous trade centers, the vast middle district only has three towns, located far apart from each other and within intact secret realms.</p><p>Cultivators with insufficient strength all stop at Gubei Town, afraid to venture deeper into the middle district.</p><p>One might call Gubei Town a town, but due to the restricted size of its secret realm, it's actually no larger in scale than a small city. It only has one main street lined with shops, and it is rarely inhabited.</p><p>Shops of all kinds are set up by the street: inns, apothecaries, and shops that specialize in buying spirit plants and evil possessed items.</p><p>Most of the cultivators with the strength to make it to Gubei Town are at the foundation building realm. As such, the shops on the street might appear somewhat deserted and slow with business, but the profit margins are actually very high.</p><p>Precisely because the location of Gubei Town is unique, the prices for pills and artifacts in these shops are quite expensive; the inns' prices are as exorbitant as a small, secluded cave at Xuanluan Pass.</p><p>Fortunately, the shadow guards have a garrison in Gubei Town. Therefore, Qin Sang and the others were able to avoid these unjust fees.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stood in front of the shadow guards' garrison, looking up at the sky.</p><p>Gubei Town was built on a wasteland of red earth and yellow sand. One could clearly see whirlwinds of sand and dust that blotted out the sun; like the end of the world, these whirlwinds ceaselessly battered the 禁制 (restrictions). Amidst the sand storm was the flashing of crimson lights: the flames of the Extinguishing Heaven Fire.</p><p>The glow of the 禁制 (restrictions) was sporadic, and one could feel the terror of the natural phenomena within the secret realm.</p><p>The people living in Gubei Town seemingly paid no mind to the situation, continuing with their lives as if nothing was happening.</p><p>The space within the Immortal Battlefield is not stable, and space cracks fill the depths. Although there are no space cracks on the outskirts, it is still affected by the instability of the space within. Not only are there lightning and turbulent winds at all times in the sky; sometimes, the fluctuations in space can also cause natural phenomena to occur. The closer one gets to the heart of the Immortal Battlefield, the more frequent and powerful the natural phenomena become.</p><p>The forms of the natural phenomena are unpredictable: they could be winds that corrode bones and marrow, or they could be fire that rains down from the sky. What's more, they could turn into a鹅毛大雪 (snowstorm) at the next moment, freezing everything within thousands of miles. Sometimes, several natural phenomena might occur simultaneously: lightning and thunder, earthquakes, or collisions of ice and fire, all resulting in a magnificent spectacle.</p><p>During the natural phenomena, cloud beasts become even more active. Not only do the cultivators have to deal with the natural phenomena with all their might, they must also remain alert for cloud beasts. Fortunately, there are signs that appear before each natural phenomenon, allowing cultivators to take shelter in advance.</p><p>Outside, the natural phenomena were rampant. Inside Gubei Town, however, it had become more lively than usual. Cultivators seized the opportunity to trade and replenish their supplies.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, the garrison sergeant said that this natural phenomenon will soon be over. Senior Brother Yin previously gave us orders to gather at the secret realm entrance. We will depart as soon as the natural phenomenon ends," a female voice said from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and saw a woman in plain clothes. It was actually Yun Qiong, one of their companions. He nodded in response.</p><p>He looked left and right, but he did not see Senior Brother Mu. Qin Sang shook his head in helplessness and followed Yun Qiong along to the entrance of the secret realm.</p><p>Amongst the ten shadow guards present, four were at the foundation building realm. The other six were all at or above the tenth level of Qi Refining.</p><p>According to the usual custom, having three foundation building realm early phase cultivators would have been enough.</p><p>The most important aspect of mining Sun Essence Quartz was to shield their own fluctuations from being detected by the cloud beasts. As long as they could successfully infiltrate the area, extracting the Sun Essence Quartz would not entail much danger. Even Qi Refining realm cultivators could complete the task, as the extraction site would be on the surface.</p><p>The object they relied upon was a star disk-shaped artifact gifted by Xuanluan Pass. With three foundation building realm cultivators operating it together, they could cover a large range, sustain its operation for a long time, which would be more than enough to mine the quartz.</p><p>In the event of an emergency, they could reduce the range of the artifact's coverage and send personnel to address the crisis.</p><p>Originally, they had decided on Senior Brother Mu Yifeng, Qin Sang, and Yun Qiong, along with seven Qi Refining realm shadow guards.</p><p>The three of them were all at the early phase of the foundation building realm. Qin Sang had made up his mind to not steal any limelight, letting Senior Brother Mu lead the team. As for that Yun Qiong, he surely wouldn't be able to stir up any waves.</p><p>Unexpectedly, on the eve of their departure, someone named Yin Xingge had suddenly inserted himself into their group.</p><p>Yin Xingge came from the Medicine King Sect, while Yun Qiong was a disciple of the Misty Rain Tower. Both sects were long-standing sects in the Little Cold Domain. While they did not have Nascent Soul Grand Elders, they did have several Golden Core Elders, so their strength could not be underestimated. Several sects comparable to the Medicine King Sect joined together at the Skull Pass and were able to have a say in some decisions.</p><p>Although the Medicine King Sect was inferior to the Shaohua Mountain, Yin Xingge had a cultivation base in the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment realm, the highest of the four. In the immortal cultivation world, strength was revered, so Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng could only obey his orders.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel that Mu Yifeng was displeased, but fortunately, this person understood the importance of the overall situation and did not act on his whims, merely becoming more perfunctory in his actions.</p><p>He could also guess that Yin Xingge had probably come for the Ganyang Crystal.</p><p>The Ganyang Crystal was a rare spirit material that could be used to refine magic treasures. Golden Core Elders needed this item to refine extreme yang magic treasures. If they could bring a piece of Ganyang Crystal back this time, everyone's contribution points would be increased tenfold, and the person who discovered the Ganyang Crystal first might even receive a reward from a Golden Core Elder.</p><p>Whether Yin Xingge had been instructed by a Golden Core Elder from his sect or was coveting the tenfold contribution points, what he valued must have been the Ganyang Crystal.</p><p>Such a precious object as the Ganyang Crystal was naturally not something that could be encountered every time they mined. Otherwise, the Golden Core Elders would have led the team themselves.</p><p>However, the mineral vein had not produced any Ganyang Crystal for decades. According to the previous pattern, the probability was slightly higher now, but it was only slightly.</p><p>They continued walking along the street, heading outward and gradually going downhill.</p><p>This was because the terrain of the secret realm was a断山, and the entrance was a small river at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Before long, the two of them reached the end of the street and saw a jade belt ahead. There was a wooden pier by the river, and several old wooden boats were floating around the pier. There were no ropes, but they remained motionless in the flowing water. In fact, they were magic treasures for entering and leaving the secret realm.</p><p>At this time, more than ten people had gathered on the pier, waiting for the secret realm to open and leave.</p><p>Yin Xingge and the other seven were standing together. The other six were Shadow Guards in the Qi Refining realm, including disciples from three major sects. However, they did not dare to neglect Yin Xingge's orders in the slightest and had come to wait early.</p><p>"Junior Sister Yun Qiong, Fellow Daoist Qin..."</p><p>Yin Xingge nodded and greeted them. Seeing that Mu Yifeng had not arrived, his brows furrowed slightly, but he did not say much.</p>
