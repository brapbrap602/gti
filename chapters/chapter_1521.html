<h1></h1><p>Xiaoxiang Zi's arrangements within the stone stele space were comprehensive, not a path of certain death; otherwise, leaving behind treasures would have been pointless.</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to place the Pagoda of the Floating World in his hand on the jade platform to activate the entire grand formation, sealing the stone stele space.</p><p>At the final moment, the Pagoda of the Floating World would trigger the Exquisite Pagoda, sending those inside out of the sacred ground.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the instructions in Xiaoxiang Zi's jade slip and completely mastered the Pagoda of the Floating World.</p><p>Outside the Exquisite Pagoda, demons and monsters were laying siege, but fortunately, Xiaoxiang Zi had left them a way out.</p><p>However, once the spirit formation was activated, the fate of the demons and monsters outside would likely not be pleasant.</p><p>Qin Sang had asked Hall Master Jiang and the others to leave quickly because he was worried about implicating them.</p><p>Upon learning the details of the situation, Liuli's eyes flashed with astonishment.</p><p>To annihilate so many demons and monsters in one fell swoop, while the lineage of the Nine Great Saints still held sway over the demon race, the Boundless Sea would face an unprecedented reshuffling.</p><p>If Qin Sang's prediction came true, the demonic path would suffer a crippling blow, leaving a pristine, unsullied landscape.</p><p>Qin Sang turned back and picked up the jade box.</p><p>The moment the jade box opened, Qin Sang and Liuli felt their eyes brighten, a green fluorescent light instantly illuminating the space of the seventh level.</p><p>The tip of his nose detected a faint, elegant fragrance, seeming to carry the scent of various plants and trees, yet highly unified. Qin Sang felt as if he were in a vibrant jungle.</p><p>The fragrance permeated his heart and mind, bringing a sense of tranquility.</p><p>Just smelling the fragrance had such an effect; the Soul-Suppressing Incense was truly worthy of its name.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly, seeing four slender jade sticks, almost jade-like in texture, arranged side by side in the jade box. This was indeed the Soul-Suppressing Incense. Each stick was crystal clear and flawless, like a naturally formed precious jade.</p><p>The Soul-Suppressing Incense could stabilize the mind and suppress inner demons. It was extremely useful during breakthroughs and tribulations, making it a rare and invaluable treasure.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang possessed the even more powerful Jade Buddha, so the Soul-Suppressing Incense in his hands was like a pearl covered in dust, only useful for trading with others.</p><p>However, for Liuli, the Soul-Suppressing Incense held extraordinary significance.</p><p>The brand of the evil art was equivalent to Liuli's inner demon.</p><p>Even if it couldn't resolve the brand of the evil art, it could help Liuli suppress the brand during future breakthroughs, reducing its influence.</p><p>In the battle with Yin Changsheng, Liuli had willingly released the seal and become his Dark Maiden. Qin Sang was inevitably moved, and he seriously considered what methods he could use to help her.</p><p>He did not possess his Senior Sister's astonishing talent in the way of puppets, and could not create the Heart Demon Puppet Seal. The only thing close to it was the "Lifeless Demonic Seal".</p><p>But cultivating the "Lifeless Demonic Seal" was extremely dangerous, akin to actively creating an inner demon, nurturing it little by little, and finally shattering the seal to achieve a breakthrough.</p><p>The brand in Liuli's body was already so severe that it affected her cultivation. If Liuli dared to use the "Lifeless Demonic Seal" for cultivation, she would likely be immediately devoured by the inner demon and die.</p><p>The Soul-Suppressing Incense might help her temporarily overcome the difficulty. With her cultivation and strength advancing, more possibilities would emerge.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>Liuli's gaze was also drawn to the Soul-Suppressing Incense. She stared at it for a moment, then exclaimed in surprise: "Is this Soul-Suppressing Incense?"</p><p>"You recognize it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned, then remembered that Xiaoxiang Zi had a deep connection with Profound Sky Palace. Profound Sky Palace might have records of the Soul-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>Liuli nodded gently, remained silent for a moment, then raised her head to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>Her eyes were as clear as colored glaze, filled with anticipation, but devoid of greed.</p><p>"If you are willing to let the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal acknowledge me as its master and give me some time, I am seventy percent confident that I can comprehend the complete Treasure Controlling Incantation."</p><p>Liuli paused, then added, "At that time, I can sever my connection with the spiritual treasure, not affecting your control of the treasure."</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang's eyes flickered with a strange light.</p><p>He had thought that the Treasure Controlling Incantation would be completely incomplete with the fall of Yin Changsheng, but unexpectedly, there was a twist.</p><p>This contradicted Tong Lingyu's statement. She had once said that if the person who refined the spiritual treasure did not engrave the Treasure Controlling Incantation on the spiritual treasure, once the Treasure Controlling Incantation was lost, only the person whom the spiritual treasure willingly acknowledged as its master could wield it.</p><p>Was this true for all spiritual treasures, or was the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal unique?</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that it was most likely the former.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's understanding of spiritual treasures was only superficial, and there might be many areas where she had been misled by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Half a Treasure Controlling Incantation and a complete Treasure Controlling Incantation were worlds apart. The former was just a useless, insignificant thing!</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was not carried away by this good news. He looked at Liuli, his expression peculiar.</p><p>"I want to exchange for one stick of Soul-Suppressing Incense!"</p><p>Liuli took a deep breath and said.</p><p>She could have completely concealed this matter and tried to exchange the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal back from Qin Sang.</p><p>With only half of the Treasure Controlling Incantation, the power of the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal in Qin Sang's hands was greatly reduced, far inferior to the Sun God Tree, and not indispensable.</p><p>As long as Profound Sky Palace offered enough sincerity to move Qin Sang, there was a chance.</p><p>But Liuli chose the Soul-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>She knew the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique". One day, when she became a Grand Cultivator, she would be able to refine her Natal Magical Treasure into a pseudo-spiritual treasure, which could barely serve as a substitute.</p><p>Before that, she possessed the supreme divine ability, "Ice Soul Divine Light", and lacked no means to challenge those of a higher realm.</p><p>The Soul-Suppressing Incense was something that could be encountered but not sought, bringing her the possibility of continuing her pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>Spiritual treasures were a great temptation, but they could not bewilder Liuli's Dao Heart.</p><p>As for the inheritance of Profound Sky Palace.</p><p>She had no feelings for Profound Sky Palace. She first followed her master, then cultivated at Shaohua Mountain, only returning to the Northern Sea after forming her Nascent Soul.</p><p>After experiencing the battle with Yin Changsheng, and thinking of her master being forced to flee to other lands, wandering everywhere, she couldn't possibly have any good feelings.</p><p>She only recognized Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>It wasn't just because of her master.</p><p>Shi Xue and Hall Master Jiang had both shown her great care and affection.</p><p>Liuli had already thought about how to strengthen Listening Snow Tower, continue her master's legacy, and repay them.</p><p>"Actually, your cultivation technique and the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal are not compatible. This treasure is rather special. Only those who cultivate ice-attribute cultivation techniques can unleash its full power. Your clone is more suitable than your main body."</p><p>Liuli then pointed out another problem.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered thoughtfully, knowing that Liuli had no reason to deceive him.</p><p>In fact, he had a premonition long ago. When Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu wielded the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal, their attacks were accompanied by a chilling aura. This chilling aura came not only from the spiritual treasure but also from the wielder.</p><p>Qin Sang could not change his cultivation technique, and could only hope that his external incarnation would break through to the late Nascent Soul stage before it could display its divine might.</p><p>It was already the result of several fortunate encounters that his clone had reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Continuing to break through would be extremely difficult!</p><p>Liuli pointing this out was clearly reducing her own bargaining chips before the transaction.</p><p>"After I used the Ice Soul Astral Essence to cultivate the "Ice Soul Divine Light", I discovered that cultivating this divine ability was not as strict as imagined, but rather that the predecessors of Listening Snow Tower had taken a detour. I already have some clues, and with some slight modifications to the divine ability, others also have a chance to cultivate it. At that time, I can pass the divine ability to you. Your clone used the Ice Soul Astral Essence to establish its foundation, and although it does not meet the other conditions, there is a small probability that it can be cultivated..."</p><p>Liuli quickened her speech, throwing out a second bargaining chip.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang did not have such thoughts, facing these two conditions, who could not be tempted?</p><p>Looking deeply at Liuli, Qin Sang sighed softly: "Why must Fairy be like this? You and I cooperated to enter the pagoda. How could Qin Sang monopolize the treasures? Moreover, I previously borrowed the Ice Soul Astral Essence from you. To be honest, in Qin Sang's view, although the value of the Soul-Suppressing Incense is high, it is not as valuable as the other two fragments. I have been searching for the fragments for many years. They are something I must obtain, and I cannot share them equally with Fairy, but..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, Liuli shook her head in refusal, her face full of seriousness: "Borrowing the Astral Jade was for the Eight-Winged Ice Cicada. You have already accomplished it, and have been implicated because of it. Being able to enter the Exquisite Pagoda is due to your small pagoda. Moreover, without me, you could also break through the encirclement of demons and monsters."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, not knowing how to persuade Liuli.</p><p>It was the first time he had experienced such a thing, actively wanting to give someone a treasure, but being desperately refused by the other party.</p><p>Qin Sang was very clear that Liuli was obviously severing all ties with him, leaving no room for maneuver.</p><p>Refusing to accept even the slightest benefit from him!</p><p>No matter how far-fetched the reason.</p><p>It was enough to convince herself.</p><p>Before, when Liuli interacted with him, she had actually adhered to this principle, but not so deliberately.</p><p>The hidden dangers left by Liuli's release of the brand were likely far more terrible than imagined!</p><p>Evil arts truly had endless repercussions!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed in his heart, feeling somewhat helpless.</p><p>Others couldn't wait to take advantage of everything, but Liuli was the opposite.</p><p>One extreme and another extreme.</p><p>Qin Sang had never experienced such a thing, and did not know the taste of being controlled by a brand, so he could not empathize with Liuli.</p><p>Judging from Liuli's performance, it was also impossible for her to share with him or ask him for help.</p><p>Intuition told Qin Sang that this extreme approach might not be effective. Liuli considered everything, becoming more and more deeply entangled. Wouldn't this become another inner demon?</p><p>But evil arts were unfathomable. Liuli had closed herself off, and Qin Sang could not offer any better suggestions. He could only helplessly remind her, "Fairy is a little too attached to appearances..."</p><p>Liuli was slightly startled, but her eyes remained firm, not changing her mind because of this.</p><p>"Alright! I agree!"</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled a breath of turbid air, his expression sinking, and he nodded heavily, agreeing to the matter.</p><p>He took out two sticks of Soul-Suppressing Incense from the jade box, closed the box, and handed it to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>"Is a spiritual treasure not worth two sticks of Soul-Suppressing Incense?" Qin Sang asked rhetorically.</p><p>"For you, it is indeed not."</p><p>Liuli said.</p><p>Tong Lingyu did not dare to come and ask for it, and the spiritual treasure belonged to Qin Sang in the first place.</p><p>The function of treasures differed, suitable for different people.</p><p>A treasure that someone dreamed of might be discarded by another like worn-out shoes.</p><p>It could not be simply measured by value.</p><p>She knew that Qin Sang possessed the Sun God Tree, which was not inferior to the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal.</p><p>The black spiritual fire of the Demonic Banner was also not as simple as it appeared.</p><p>He was not lacking in powerful magical treasures and divine abilities. The Four-Multiply Serpent Seal was not something Qin Sang must obtain, it was dispensable.</p><p>Holding four sticks of Soul-Suppressing Incense, there might be a sliver of a possibility of advancing to the Deity Transformation Stage, which was incomparable to any spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Qin Sang had a sufficiently firm heart towards the Dao during the Foundation Establishment stage. Now that I am at the Nascent Soul stage, how can I regress instead of advancing, being hindered by inner demons? In addition, Fairy cannot deny the role you played in dealing with the Mixed Demon Old Man. Does Fairy want to make Qin Sang unrighteous?"</p><p>Qin Sang was able to compete with a Nascent Soul cultivator in Dao Heart during the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>This was something Liuli had personally experienced.</p><p>Liuli was silent for a moment, and finally did not argue further. She reached out and took the jade box.</p><p>With the weight lifted from his hand, Qin Sang surprisingly felt a sense of relief, more tiring than a great battle.</p><p>Carefully putting away the two sticks of Soul-Suppressing Incense.</p><p>"If Fairy has any further needs in the future, you can come to me to exchange for Soul-Suppressing Incense. At that time, Fairy will understand that Qin Sang truly does not value this item highly."</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang looked into Liuli's clear eyes and added, "A fair trade."</p><p>Liuli replied, "Alright."</p><p>Next, Qin Sang picked up the fragment of the Killing Sword.</p><p>The moment his fingers touched the fragment of the Killing Sword, Qin Sang felt the fragments within his body tremble slightly. The sword spirit finally reacted again.</p><p>The fragment of the Killing Sword silently disappeared from his fingertip.</p><p>Qin Sang did not receive a response from the sword spirit. He sank into his Qi Sea and found that all the fragments had combined, without the slightest gap between them, perfectly fused!</p><p>The blade was thin, yet it had a strange sense of heaviness.</p><p>From the blade and the tip, no obvious sharpness could be felt, whether it was the inherent temperament of the sword or because it had not fully recovered.</p><p>On the body of the sword, the ancient characters 'Earth' and 'Killing' had a profound charm, as if they were just simple characters, yet as if they encompassed everything.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that he could immerse himself in these two characters alone for a long, long time...</p><p>Four fragments of the Killing Sword formed a complete blade, but without a hilt.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang could not be sure whether the Earth Killing Sword in his hand was complete.</p><p>There might still be a hilt, or another section of a fragment above it.</p><p>Before the sword spirit awakened, he could not give up searching.</p><p>The serious problem was that there was no cultivation technique in the jade slip, and Xiaoxiang Zi did not mention it at all.</p><p>According to Xiaoxiang Zi's records, he obtained these two fragments of the Killing Sword in the Central Province, from ancient Immortal Mansions, namely Heavenly Unity Hall and Heavenly Minister Hall.</p><p>Xiaoxiang Zi estimated that the remaining fragments should have fallen into other similar Immortal Mansions, and instructed future generations to search carefully if they had any new discoveries.</p><p>To investigate the whereabouts of the cultivation technique, Qin Sang could only start with Xiaoxiang Zi's origins, and even personally go to the Central Province!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pure Sea Sect no longer existed, and the ancient texts of Profound Sky Palace had also been lost.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda shook more and more violently.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and put away the jade slip as well.</p><p>There was still a lot of content inside, and there was no time to read it carefully. He had to escape the dangerous situation first.</p><p>"It should be about time..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Calculating the time, if Hall Master Jiang and the others had immediately retreated upon receiving the reminder, they should be close to leaving the stone stele space now.</p><p>He could not wait any longer, otherwise, the golden light barrier would be broken, and the demons and monsters would be able to rush into the pagoda.</p><p>The reason why the golden light barrier did not seem strong enough was that its true function was not defense, but to conceal the commotion caused by activating the Exquisite Pagoda, so as not to be detected by the demonic leaders.</p><p>The activation of the spirit formation was not an instant process, it required time.</p><p>Now, the demons and monsters were just outside the Exquisite Pagoda, so naturally, there was no need for concealment.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Liuli, picked up the Pagoda of the Floating World, and gently placed it in the center of the jade platform.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The Pagoda of the Floating World and the jade platform merged into one, a flash of light, and an invisible fluctuation spread out, blending into the entire Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>The auras of the two were completely fused.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, feeling as if the true essence in his body had encountered a black hole, being sucked in wildly.</p><p>With Xiaoxiang Zi's reminder, Qin Sang was not flustered. He remained calm and focused all his attention on the Pagoda of the Floating World.</p><p>Through this treasure, Qin Sang felt as if his thoughts were extending outwards infinitely.</p><p>First, it was the Exquisite Pagoda, then it rapidly expanded until he sensed the entire spirit formation.</p><p>The spirit formation was extremely mysterious. Qin Sang had seen more brilliant and grand Immortal formations, but this was the first time he had come into contact with it in this way. He was deeply shocked!</p><p>He did not dare to act recklessly, and followed Xiaoxiang Zi's instructions, activating the grand formation step by step!</p>
