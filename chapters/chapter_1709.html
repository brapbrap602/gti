<h1>Chapter 1700: Honored Guest</h1><p>“Compensation?”</p><p>The Avatar let out a cold laugh.</p><p>Neither Venerable Huiguang nor Saint King Qinghu responded to his reaction.</p><p>They believed that with Qin Sang's cultivation, he wouldn't lose control of his emotions, so there was no need to waste words.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang pressed his palms together. The Sand Shadow's expression and eyes appeared dull and lifeless, yet anyone who met his gaze felt an inexplicable sense of oppression.</p><p>The Avatar remained silent for a moment, seemingly aware that this tactic was ineffective.</p><p>He couldn't feel the pressure emanating from the Sand Shadow, nor did he ask what exactly had attracted Saint King Qinghu's covetous gaze.  He was simply curious, and posed a question in return.</p><p>“Why does the Venerable Monk wade into these troubled waters?”</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>Venerable Huiguang chanted a Buddhist prayer. “The feud between the two benefactors has not yet reached the point of no return. Though Benefactor Qin has not yet reached Deity Transformation, he stands at the pinnacle of this world’s power.  A conflict between the two of you would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences. This humble monk cannot bear to see your feud deepen, implicating innocent beings and plunging the cultivation world into eternal unrest. Thus, I first dissuaded the Saint King, and now I discuss the matter with Benefactor Qin.”</p><p>Hearing these words, the Avatar's eyes turned icy.</p><p>What he heard in Venerable Huiguang's words wasn't compassion, but a threat.</p><p>Of course, this threat didn't originate from Venerable Huiguang himself. It was a conveyance of Saint King Qinghu's intentions through the Venerable Monk.</p><p>She would not relent until her goal was achieved!</p><p>Saint King Qinghu had set her sights on him. If he failed to satisfy her demands, he could expect relentless pursuit from her and the Saint King's Palace.</p><p>Once he refined the origin of the Demonic Fire, Qin Sang might be able to contend with a Deity Transformation cultivator, but that was all.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu commanded the Saint King's Palace and countless Great Demons, while his own forces were too weak. Only his Avatar could be considered a formidable presence.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guard wouldn't even be enough to fill the bellies of the妖族.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang ignored the threat of the ferocious beasts within the Storm Belt and fled to the Northern Sea or the Boundless Sea.  The Western Lands would be the easiest, but after the Ghost Mother's success, the Buddhist forces would undoubtedly be heavily guarding the area, making it unsafe.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had to ensure that he didn't leave any trace.  Most of this world was Storm Belt, and safe havens were few.  Did anyone truly believe the Storm Belt could withstand the pursuit of a Deity Transformation cultivator?</p><p>Who could say for certain that the powers of the Central Continent didn't possess a map of this world’s seas?</p><p>Of course, this was the worst-case scenario.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu might not be willing to expend so much energy pursuing him to the Outer Territories.</p><p>But one thing was certain: the Central Continent was no longer safe.</p><p>Even if Deerfield was sufficiently concealed to ensure Qin Sang's safety, he certainly wouldn't dare to release the Nether Moon Guard. Once his influence was uprooted and his connection to the outside world severed, he would be isolated.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao was willing to serve a Deity Transformation cultivator, it was likely their dealings had been exposed.</p><p>Not only would the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit become a pipe dream, but even leaving his sanctuary would become difficult.</p><p>And Qin Sang's future cultivation, as well as the Spirit Nurturing techniques from the *Panhu True Scripture*, would certainly require external resources.</p><p>Worse still, if Qin Sang ignored Venerable Huiguang's warning, the Venerable Monk, to prevent the demon race from wreaking havoc on the cultivation world, might have the Buddhist sects secretly cooperate with Saint King Qinghu to quickly quell the unrest.</p><p>At that time, the entire world would be his enemy!</p><p>Venerable Huiguang, maintaining his composure, hadn't explicitly threatened him, but Qin Sang had to consider this possibility.</p><p>The Avatar was enraged, and he roared fiercely, “Is the Saint King not afraid that Qin will infiltrate the Eastern Sea and slaughter the entire Saint King’s Palace?!”</p><p>Saint King Qinghu, who had remained silent since her appearance, finally spoke.</p><p>“This King was once a wild fox in the mountains of the land. Absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, I gained sentience, only to attract the attention of cultivators. This King narrowly escaped with her life, but all my kin in the den perished tragically.  Having heard of the vast power of the demon race in the sea, with nowhere else to turn, this King drifted alone on a piece of driftwood to the Eastern Sea. Yet, the demon race's internal strife was even more brutal. Without the protection of my kin, I lived in hiding, constantly hunted.  Finally, I understood the principle of survival of the fittest. Before ascending to the position of Saint King, bloodshed was my constant companion, and countless demon souls fell before me. I have only enemies, no kin. What does it matter if you slaughter the demon race of the Eastern Sea?”</p><p>Her tone was languid, as if recounting an experience entirely unrelated to her.</p><p>Anyone who heard these words, even through the Communication Talisman, couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p>Deity Transformation cultivators were not terrifying; what was terrifying was a Deity Transformation cultivator without scruples.</p><p>Sects were the weakness of the Daoist and Buddhist Deity Transformation cultivators.  Despite their ability to dominate the Immortal Halls, they always left a margin for error.</p><p>Especially with Deity Transformation cultivators, regardless of their background, even an old devil like Old Devil Lu, with his blood-soaked hands, was treated with courtesy first, force only as a last resort, escorted out with respect.</p><p>Even Venerable Huiguang treated such a Saint King Qinghu with deference.</p><p>These were Saint King Qinghu's words, and perhaps there was an element of bluster, but her attitude was clear.</p><p>Against such an opponent, threats were meaningless.</p><p>“How do I know that Saint King Qinghu isn’t using the Venerable Monk to lure Qin out? And how will the Venerable Monk guarantee Qin’s safety?”</p><p>The Avatar ceased arguing and questioned Venerable Huiguang, going straight to the heart of the matter.</p><p>This was precisely the question Venerable Huiguang had been waiting for. As if he had a plan prepared, he spoke rapidly, “This humble monk is aware of Benefactor Qin’s concerns, and today I intend to discuss this matter with you. Firstly, Saint King Qinghu and I shall swear a Heart Demon Oath, vowing never to harm your true body, Avatar, or loved ones. If the Saint King breaks this oath, I will not stand idly by.  The content of the oath will be drafted by me, and the two benefactors may add any further stipulations…”</p><p>Venerable Huiguang swiftly recited the content of the oath.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't concerned with how detailed the oath was. He said indifferently, “To be frank with the Venerable Monk, I have always harbored reservations about Heart Demon Oaths.  Setting aside the various methods of circumvention, even Grand Buddhist Vows can be broken or abandoned. What value then, a mere oath?”</p><p>Seemingly anticipating Qin Sang's response, Venerable Huiguang replied without hesitation, “Since I am acting as guarantor, the resolution of the feud between the two benefactors should take place within our temple.  I intend to invite Daoist Qingfeng to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery for a discourse. With such an honored guest, our temple gates will be thrown wide open to welcome Daoist Qingfeng! At that time, I shall erect a ceremonial altar, and you shall witness the Saint King swear the Karmic Oath.”</p><p>When he uttered the words 'Daoist Qingfeng,' Venerable Huiguang deliberately emphasized his tone.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng?”</p><p>The Avatar's heart stirred, faintly grasping Venerable Huiguang's intentions.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Xie family had journeyed to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery aboard the Dragon Dwelling Cave Heaven's flying ship, in full view of the public.</p><p>The Dragon Dwelling Cave Heaven seemed to want to witness the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery's predicament, escorting the flying ship all the way to the temple gates.</p><p>The entire Xie family disembarked and knelt before the gates.</p><p>Master Xingji personally emerged, speaking kindly and persuasively, welcoming the Xie family into the temple and providing them with suitable accommodations. The Xie family remained at the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery to this day.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Venerable Huiguang declared solemnly, “The Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, along with the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Sky Reaching Tower, will announce to the world that Daoist Qingfeng, ancestor of the Xie family, played a crucial role in the battle against the demonic being, saving countless lives by contributing the Demon Sealing Stake, a treasure of immense power.  To this end, I have contacted Sect Master Situ of Mount Bunian and intend to discuss with all parties the transfer of Futu and Hongping Counties, as well as Bo County of Ning Province, to the Xie family.”</p><p>Hearing these words, the Avatar was greatly surprised.</p><p>He hadn't expected Venerable Huiguang to take the initiative to clear his name before the world and even grant the Xie family such substantial benefits.</p><p>Futu and Hongping Counties were secondary; these were territories Qin Sang had conquered from the Six Void Sect. If not for this incident, once Qin Sang had freed his hands and subdued the Six Void Sect, they would have eventually belonged to him anyway.</p><p>The key was Bo County of Ning Province!</p><p>Ning Province was one of the six central provinces, bordering Zhuo Province, and one of the most prosperous regions of the Central Continent. Bo County was located on the border of the two provinces, adjacent to Hongping County.</p><p>The six central provinces had long been divided amongst the top sects like the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, forming a complex and impenetrable network.</p><p>A county, in the寸土寸金Central Continent, was not insignificant, and it would bring unimaginable benefits to the Xie family, far beyond what they could have dreamed of before.</p><p>The Xie family was on the verge of prosperity, poised to return to the ranks of prominent clans!</p><p>For Qin Sang, the most tangible benefit was Venerable Huiguang publicly clearing his name. From now on, he could occupy the moral high ground, openly operating in the cultivation world as the ancestor of the Xie family, albeit only through his Avatar.</p><p>As for why Venerable Huiguang wanted to separate his true body from his Avatar, Qin Sang quickly understood.</p><p>Clearing the name of his Avatar and the Xie family was a form of appeasement, a way to silence the rumors circulating throughout the world.</p><p>However, Saint King Qinghu's attack on his true body occurred right in front of Venerable Huiguang. If he didn't separate Qin Sang's true body from his Avatar, it would inevitably raise suspicions.  If Venerable Huiguang claimed to be preoccupied with dealing with the demonic being and hadn't noticed the connection between the Avatar and the true body, few would believe him.</p><p>“Does the Venerable Monk also have requests for Qin?” the Avatar asked in return.</p><p>Back then, Venerable Huiguang had exchanged Five Elements Pills for the Demon Sealing Stake, which could be considered a reward for his contributions. Qin Sang hadn't intended to use his merits to coerce the Buddhist sects further, or he would offend both the Daoist and Buddhist Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>Now, with Venerable Huiguang personally acting as guarantor and publicly clearing his name, there must be an ulterior motive!</p><p>Venerable Huiguang didn't deny it. “Daoist Qingfeng will continue as the ancestor of the Xie family, but Benefactor Qin must not leave behind any legacy of the Formless Immortal Sect within the Xie family. Furthermore, your true body must not collude with any sects of the Central Continent or participate in their disputes. If you have any disciples in the future, they must not preach in the Central Continent…”</p><p>Several consecutive 'must nots' made the Avatar chuckle wryly.</p><p>Though he wasn't explicitly forbidden from setting foot in the Central Continent, it amounted to the same thing.</p><p>Especially the restriction on the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy—did they all suspect him of being a descendant of the Fire Aspect Hall?</p><p>He didn't want to bear such a false accusation.</p><p>“Whether the Venerable Monk believes it or not, Qin is not a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect,” the Avatar stated frankly.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang continued, as if to himself, “As long as you comply, when you achieve Deity Transformation, we will treat you as an equal.  All secrets regarding post-Deity Transformation and ascension will be revealed to you without reservation.”</p><p>Whether Qin Sang was a remnant of the Formless Immortal Sect was no longer important.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang had initially planned to eliminate them all, but now with such a significant turn of events, even a fool would know that a reckoning was inevitable.  The remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect were in hiding, and it wouldn't be easy to find them in the short term.</p><p>Thus, Venerable Huiguang changed his strategy.</p><p>Using the ancient demon's reappearance, he spread the news, claiming that the ancient demon had been awakened by a remnant of the Formless Immortal Sect.  He declared that the Formless Immortal Sect's downfall was due to its upper echelons being corrupted by demonic influence, becoming minions of the ancient demon, and that the cultivation world had paid a heavy price to prevent the spread of this demonic corruption, but its effects lingered to this day.</p><p>After so much time, even if someone knew the truth, they wouldn't have any evidence, and they wouldn't need to conceal anything further.</p><p>Simultaneously, he disseminated the *Soul Calming Mantra* throughout the cultivation world, allowing cultivators to examine themselves. This way, everyone in the cultivation world would be in a state of unease, and any descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect would be hunted down.</p><p>The most important reason was that Venerable Huiguang was running out of time.</p><p>Having witnessed the Demon Spirit’s miserable fate, Saint King Qinghu had lost her patience. She wouldn't wait for him to gain complete control before setting out. This time, she intended to seize the Soul Calming Incense for herself, and who knew what trouble she might cause in the future.</p><p>Therefore, Venerable Huiguang's arrangements for the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery deviated significantly from his original plan. He intended to rally the Eight Scenery Pavilion, the Sky Reaching Tower, and other forces to forge a lasting alliance, the details of which were still to be discussed.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s eyes, Venerable Huiguang’s conditions were quite sincere.</p><p>He had no aspirations for dominance, nor did he expect the Green Ram Temple to flourish. He hadn't intended to interfere in the affairs of the Central Continent either.  The Green Ram Temple controlled Deerfield, a top-tier cultivation sanctuary.  In the future, they could simply occupy some territory in the Northern Wilderness.  There was no need to compete for resources in the Central Continent.</p><p>Once the name of Daoist Qingfeng spread throughout the world, his Avatar could openly visit.  While absolute safety couldn't be guaranteed, if Venerable Huiguang intended to turn against him, why go through so much trouble?  And the one being deceived would only be his Avatar.</p><p>Indeed, despite Venerable Huiguang's numerous promises, Qin Sang didn’t intend to reveal his true body.</p><p>“May I ask what treasure has caught the Saint King’s eye?”</p><p>Sensing Venerable Huiguang’s sincerity, the Avatar’s thoughts raced, and he finally inquired about the object of Saint King Qinghu’s desire.  If it were the Vermillion Bird Plume or any of the other supreme treasures, he wouldn't agree under any circumstances.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Saint King Qinghu replied, “Soul Calming Incense.”</p><p>“Soul Calming Incense?”</p><p>The Avatar was incredulous, almost spitting blood.</p><p>It was the Soul Calming Incense that had caused such a huge uproar.</p><p>Had he known, he would never have put it up for auction!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Avatar started to speak, then stopped.</p><p>This Saint King Qinghu was a lunatic.  The Soul Calming Incense was useless to her. If she had simply asked politely, a trade, or even offering the incense to save his life, wouldn’t have been impossible.</p><p>“Is the Soul Calming Incense something the Saint King must obtain?”</p><p>The Avatar felt puzzled. “Does this treasure have any effect at the Deity Transformation stage?”</p><p>The Soul Calming Incense was likely created by Xiao Xiangzi during the Nascent Soul stage to overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation during breakthroughs. Its effectiveness on Deity Transformation cultivators would certainly be greatly diminished, otherwise Xiao Xiangzi would have been a peerless genius.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu replied, “The effect is slight, but this King requires a large quantity of Soul Calming Incense.”</p><p>“A large quantity…”</p><p>The Avatar suddenly understood.  What she wanted was the formula.</p><p>However, Saint King Qinghu’s tone shifted. “If you are willing to trade that spiritual fire in your possession, this King would also be delighted, and will ensure your satisfaction.”</p><p>“That spiritual fire is Qin’s greatest asset. If the Saint King covets this fire, there’s no need to continue this discussion,” the Avatar said coldly. No wonder she had directly resorted to violence. It turned out she also had her eyes on the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>Venerable Huiguang interjected in a timely manner, “I have already advised the Saint King.  She seeks only the formula for the spiritual medicine, not the spiritual fire. The transaction will proceed according to Benefactor Qin’s wishes.”</p><p>The Avatar snorted coldly.  “I wonder what treasure the Saint King is willing to offer as a sign of good faith?”</p><p>“Most of the treasures in this King’s possession are demonic treasures, but there are a few related to the human race.  Humans cannot set foot in the Eastern Sea and are unaware of its riches.”</p><p>Saint King Qinghu’s tone was filled with temptation. “For instance, an ancient Spirit Gathering Formation used by humans for cultivation…”</p>
