Chapter 178 Secret Dragon Annotation

"That's right."

Listening to Senior Brother Chu not being harsh in tone, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He took out the ice coffin from the mustard seed sac.

Senior Brother Chu frowned, looking at it for a while, and slightly nodded his head: "Junior Brother Qin, please first put away the ice coffin. There will be a few senior brothers to examine it when you return to the sect."

After returning to Mount Shao Hua, Qin Sang was escorted by Senior Brother Chu to the Headmaster Peak and was settled in a grand hall.

Senior Brother Chu took away the ice coffin, and a senior brother returned the ice coffin later, and inquired him about his encounter in the cave. And then, no one cared about it anymore. Qin Sang was bold enough to calm down and cultivate in the grand hall.

Until ten days later, Senior Brother Chu appeared, and told him everything was fine.

Qin Sang didn't expect this matter would be settled so easily. He didn't know what happened these days, and he put forward a question.

Senior Brother Chu did not hide it: "Two senior brothers went to the demon lair, and ascertained that what the two junior brothers said was true. It was an accident indeed. We have already reported the incident, so naturally it's okay. Loss of Junior Sister Qing Ting and Senior Brother Jiang, we have all heard about it. Seeing the remains of Junior Sister Qing Ting, we could only sigh. Junior Brother Qin, don't forget Junior Sister Qing Ting's request. Choose a place with good geomancy to bury them to let them rest in peace."

Qin Sang promised: "Please rest assured, Senior Brother Chu. Qin Sang will definitely do this thing well."

"Okay," Senior Brother Chu replied, "I will not send you away. Feel free by yourself, Junior Brother Qin."

Seeing off Senior Brother Chu, Qin Sang pondered for a while, and he looked around and saw no Yu Dai Yueâ€™s figure, so he flew to the Pagoda Peak by himself.

The request from Senior Sister Qing Ting before she passed away was simple. She just requested Qin Sang to bury them on a small island called Ming Qin Island because they met on that island in the beginning and watched the sunrise together. They hoped to have their eternal sleep there.

Ming Qin Island was far in the depths of Yun Cang Daze. Before going there, Qin Sang intended to do some chores.

First, he went to Pagoda Peak and asked whether the sect's treasure house had collected any of the five elements' Yin items. If not, he still needed to buy some in the nearby market. Then, he went to the Daoism Peak's library to look through the books.

Gathering the five elements' Yin items was essential to prepare for making evil corpses. The steps could not go wrong. As for earth evil spirits needed for making corpses, it was simple because they could be gathered in the earth sink cave.

He had been there for several years, and he was already familiar with the earth sink cave. He knew about some secret places. He could gather enough earth evil spirits and then leave immediately without alarming others.

Next was the demon corpse of the black tiger. The demon corpses of Bai Yun Shan Ren and Qing Ting only made up three-quarters. The other quarter should be on Li Zai.

Although it was not a complete demon corpse, the black tiger demon was a great demon in the medium of the demon soul period. The magic tool made with it will definitely be better than that of the white rhinoceros demon beast. If he carefully collected some spiritual materials, it would be easy to make a superb magic tool.

However, Qin Sang intended to let Shopkeeper Wu make them all into soul-devouring cones. This one-time magic tool was handy and powerful. It was a great life-saving tool.

Anyway, it was hard to make another trip after he went to the battlefield of ancient immortals. Even if there were demon corpses, he could not make them into magic tools.

Thinking about this, Qin Sang had landed on the Pagoda Peak. He entered a grand hall and came out with a hint of joy after a while.

As expected, the sect had a collection. Qin Sang bought a cobblestone-sized nine-aperture stone and a fingernail-sized blue nether gold.

The nine-aperture stone was not with nine holes. Small holes were densely distributed on it. Yin wind was continuously blowing out from inside. With his cultivation level, when the yin wind blew on him, he felt the coldness that could not be dispelled. It was strange and unique.

And this piece of blue nether gold had been processed. It looked like a blue ice crystal. There was not much of it, but it was enough for several uses.

Neither of these two things was extremely valuable and could be bought with spiritual stones. And the price was not high. His current savings could fully afford it.

As for the ghost condor feather and the moon locust tree core, the sect also did not have them, and he could only look for them in the market.

...

Zhuang Yan was still in hard cultivation in Dian Yun Mountain. Senior Brother Wen had changed to a small Taoist boy to help him. He also recognized Qin Sang.

Hearing Qin Sang wanted to go to the library to look through the books, the Taoist boy immediately took out the key, and led the way in front. It turned out that the library was in the belly of the Daoism Peak. No wonder Qin Sang had never seen it before.

After sending Qin Sang in, the Taoist boy bowed and left.

The area of the library was really not small. Spirit formations were arranged around it to protect the wooden slips and paper. The jade slips were only a small part, which were all piled in one place. Qin Sang could easily find them after a glance of his spiritual sense.

These jade slips were randomly placed together, their contents all over the place, but mostly nothing particularly interesting. Qin Sang categorized them, and finally pulled out those related to spiritual meridians, spiritual eyes, and spiritual springs, then began reading them patiently.

...

The east was turning fish-belly white.

An inquisitive freshness filled the morning air on the Daomen peak. A drop of dew slid down a leaf vein, trembling as it paused on the tip of the leaf; a breeze blew it off, breaking into eight pieces on the stone path.

'Pop!'

The sound was clear and pleasant.

The restriction at the entrance of the library flickered, and a figure stepped out from within.

The figure was of a tall and slender build, appearing to be around thirty years old. His features were not particularly noteworthy, but his posture was upright, and the robe he wore was an exceptionally fine  garment of power. His lips were pressed tightly together, and his eyes held a look of focus and determination, giving him an air of distinction.

This person was none other than Qin Sang.

He was actually forty years old by now, but on the one hand, a cultivator's appearance would be more youthful than that of a mortal, and on the other hand, his lifespan had increased to over a hundred and fifty years since breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage; only after this would his vitality begin to decline, and by that point his appearance would stop aging, remaining fixed at the moment he broke through.

Had it not been for the fact that he had lost a tenth of his vitality to his essence being harvested, he should have looked even younger, like a young man in his early twenties.

Qin Sang carried a jade slip in his hand as he paced out of the library, his face showing a pensive expression.

The cool morning breeze caressed his face, and Qin Sang came to himself, gazing for a moment at the beauty of the scene before him. He gave a faint smile, and summoned his sword.

The sword light passed through the Sword Gate Pass and headed straight for the Wenyue town marketplace.

Qin Sang put the jade slip into his mustard seed bag; its contents were a copy from the library, an article entitled 'Secret Dragon Point Notes', which had been written by a cultivator well-versed in the art of feng shui.

It described methods for locating dragons and selecting burial sites, but they were still not as useful as the vein-seeking spirit beasts kept by the major sects. What Qin Sang found interesting was that the article mentioned a method for accelerating the formation of a spiritual spring.

The author of the slip speculated that using an exhausted spiritual spring object could speed up the formation of a spiritual spring.

If he could not find a way to quickly form the spiritual spring, Qin Sang planned to take the Nine Illusions Orchid with him, returning every few years to keep it from wilting completely, until the spiritual spring formed.

It would be more troublesome, but the Nine Illusions Orchid was a spirit medicine capable of assisting in the formation of the golden core; no amount of caution was excessive.

Now that he had a method, even though it was only the speculation of this person and had not been verified, it was worth trying.
