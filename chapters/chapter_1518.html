<h1>Chapter 1509: The Mountain and River Pearl</h1><p>Chapter 1509: The Mountain and River Pearl</p><p>“Who dares?!”</p><p>Tianpeng the Great Sage’s roar echoed through the inferno, startling the demons.</p><p>What followed astonished and enraged everyone.  A black streak of light burst from the clouds, ignoring the fiery blast, even moving against it, and hurtled towards the Exquisite Pagoda like lightning.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the black streak was revealed to be a spiritual fire, within which two figures could be faintly seen.  They were Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>From the moment the Exquisite Pagoda appeared to Qin Sang reaching the platform was merely a blink of an eye.  Qin Sang still didn't know what the Exquisite Pagoda was, or if his own Pagoda could fully control it, and to what extent.</p><p>However, these discoveries were enough to justify the risk!</p><p>The Pagoda was surrounded by even fiercer flames than below, but his Pagoda could withstand them.  The flames actually served as a natural barrier, helping to block attackers.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang noticed that the Pagoda had no door, but a golden light barrier.  He suspected that his Pagoda would allow him to pass through.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed he could likely control the Exquisite Pagoda using his own Pagoda, but the specifics remained unknown until he got inside.</p><p>At that moment, the demons were scattered, struggling against the fiery blast, creating a brief opening. Once they regrouped, forcing their way in would be impossible.  Regardless, it was worth a try.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting.  Qin Sang, ever decisive, acted instantly.  With the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire protecting him, he mentally instructed Liuli, summoned the Four-Headed Serpent Seal, grabbed her, and used lightning-speed movement to burst from the clouds.</p><p>The demons watched with hostile eyes. Though his technique was refined, it couldn't guarantee unimpeded approach to the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang pressed on, unyielding, amidst the demons' enraged roars.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire, the Hunmo Elder flew into a rage.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>He and Qin Sang had clashed numerous times; he knew the fire instantly.  Among those present, perhaps only he understood the situation.  In the Golden Summit treasure struggle, he’d been inches from the seven-story pagoda, only to have it snatched by Qin Sang.  The Hunmo Elder sensed this object lacked the similar energy signature to the Ganoderma and Ruyi, yet here it played a crucial role.</p><p>So, obtaining the Ganoderma and Ruyi from the Jinghai Sect was no coincidence.  Both treasures in the Jinghai Sect's collection had profound connections to the Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>However, neither Xuan Tian Palace's history nor any related legends mentioned this.  If a connection existed, why hadn't Xuan Tian Palace investigated after the Jinghai Sect emerged?</p><p>One was a hegemon of a realm; the other, a reclusive Buddhist sect. What was their relationship?</p><p>Qin Sang rejected his invitation, yet mysteriously appeared here.  The Hunmo Elder was both shocked and furious. He had no time to ponder Qin Sang’s presence; he only wanted to stop him!</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The Hunmo Elder bellowed, gripping his black bamboo staff, its demonic light surging to counter the fiery blast.</p><p>The force of the fiery blast was already significantly weakening, nearing its end. The Hunmo Token, constantly hovering above the Hunmo Elder as protection, was now free.</p><p>The palm-sized token shot out like a black lightning bolt, transforming into a hundred-foot phantom, its aura earth-shattering, plowing a path through the inferno.  Its overwhelming force crashed towards Qin Sang!</p><p>Meanwhile, Tianpeng the Great Sage used no artifact. The golden light from his feathers served as golden armor, protecting him unscathed within the sea of flames.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great Sage glared at Qin Sang, killing intent blazing.  His spiritual senses were even sharper than the Hunmo Elder's; he was the first to detect Qin Sang.</p><p>Flapping his giant wings, Tianpeng the Great Sage used some unknown ability, his form becoming almost invisible, transforming into a golden sun, its light like swords, piercing the heavens.  He shattered the fiery blast with immense power, countering towards the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>However, he was a step too slow, no match for Qin Sang's speed.</p><p>Then, Tianpeng the Great Sage suddenly opened its beak and spat out a white light.  Within the light was a pearl the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>The pearl was crystalline and clear, containing a miniature mountain and river landscape, vast and awe-inspiring – the mystical Mountain and River Pearl.</p><p>The Mountain and River Pearl and Hunmo Token, one black and one white, arrived almost simultaneously.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang, refusing to yield, pushed the Nine Netherworld Devil Fire to its limit.  The demonic flames soared, rivaling in intensity the surrounding inferno.</p><p>Two figures pressed on, seemingly determined to force their way into the Linglong Pagoda despite the attacks of two of the world's most powerful cultivators.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Shanhe Pearl was the first to strike the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>Mist billowed, instantly spreading to cover half the sky, revealing a landscape of mountains and rivers.  Towering mountains and mighty rivers flowed towards nothingness.  An immense pressure descended with the appearance of this scene!</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire was momentarily suppressed, its flames flickering sluggishly, as if losing their vigor.</p><p>The Shanhe Pearl wasn't a weapon of destruction, but a treasure specifically designed to subdue other magical items!  </p><p>妖修 (Yao Xiu – demon cultivators) focus on cultivating their bodies and innate abilities, not material objects. For example, the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle refines its shell, making it as powerful as, or even surpassing in some aspects, any magical artifact.</p><p>The power of a treasure collected by the Great Saint Tianpeng is beyond imagination.</p><p>While the Nine Nether Infernal Fire's power surpassed that of top-grade artifacts, it couldn't be truly suppressed by the Shanhe Pearl, but even a momentary pause was enough.</p><p>In a battle between masters, such a brief opening could be fatal!</p><p>For alongside the Shanhe Pearl came the Hunmo Order.</p><p>Hunmo Elder wouldn't miss such an opportunity!</p><p>The Hunmo Order vibrated violently.  A hundred-zhang (approx. 330ft) phantom pierced through the Shanhe Pearl’s illusion, like a gate in the void. Countless runes flickered, its power escalating, shattering the solidified infernal flames as it rapidly approached.</p><p>This attack alone could reduce two people to mincemeat.</p><p>Crisis loomed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, slightly raising his head to look at the Hunmo Order with unwavering composure.</p><p>Behind him, a figure appeared without warning.</p><p>His external manifestation, expressionless, focused on the Sun God Tree before him.  Nearly half his true energy was consumed in an instant, then the three divine birds atop the Sun God Tree blazed with light and spread their wings, flying swiftly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In a blink, the birds transformed into a crimson flame.</p><p>Hunmo Elder and Great Saint Tianpeng finally noticed something was amiss, their faces changing drastically.</p><p>By then, the Sun God Bird was already closing in on the Hunmo Order and the Shanhe Pearl.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>At that moment, the demons experienced a strange sensation – a second explosion within the platform. The power of the pseudo-spiritual treasure struck their minds like a heavy hammer.</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p>A red torrent of fire, carrying terrifying energy, swept across the void.</p><p>The mountain and river illusion created by the Shanhe Pearl, and the hundred-zhang phantom of the Hunmo Order, were instantly engulfed in the crimson flames, obliterated without resistance.</p><p>Even the Nine Nether Infernal Fire paled in comparison to the Nanming Li Fire.</p>
