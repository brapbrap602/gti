<h1>Chapter 649: Bloodbone Pill</h1><p>Manager Bai nodded and handed Qin Sang a jade slip.  "Fellow Daoist asked me to gather information on prominent figures in this region over the past two hundred years. That's not difficult. I've asked various friends for help, and collected a great deal of information some time ago. Are you looking for someone? Perhaps providing more details would be helpful."</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade slip and examined it.  It was densely filled with names.  Although the Western Frontier is barren, it's not without its talented individuals. Many powerful figures emerged over the past two centuries, their names widely known. The jade slip recorded their exploits.</p><p>Hearing Manager Bai's words, Qin Sang raised an eyelid slightly.  "No need for you to trouble yourself, Manager Bai. My cultivation has stagnated, and I don't want to remain secluded in my cave dwelling. I've decided to travel and gather some information beforehand, to avoid unwittingly offending someone I shouldn't."</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't specifically mention Qingzhu.</p><p>He now realized that the location of the ancient teleportation array was well-hidden.</p><p>Years ago, when Senior Qingzhu came to the Western Frontier, perhaps they too were concealing their identity, quietly searching for the ancient teleportation array.  If they failed to find it, they would have silently left the Western Frontier and returned to the human territory.</p><p>Staying on the Witch God Continent wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>He asked Manager Bai to collect information on prominent figures, holding onto a glimmer of hope of finding clues from their stories.</p><p>Manager Bai chuckled. "Fellow Daoist is overthinking. These powerful individuals only dominated the Western Frontier for a time. Once they reach a certain cultivation level, unless they have deep ties to their sect or believe their immortal path is hopeless, most won't choose to remain in the Western Frontier.  They either travel outside the Western Frontier, even beyond the Witch God Continent, or go to the Stormy Demon Sea to hunt demons."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  He asked, "I heard that one can only reach the Stormy Demon Sea via the Witch God Mountain, using the teleportation array?"</p><p>Manager Bai nodded. "The Stormy Demon Sea is beyond the Canglang Sea. Nobody knows its exact location within the boundless storms. One can only reach the islands occupied by both races in the demon sea via teleportation arrays. I'm not familiar with the human race's teleportation array, but the Witch race's are all on Witch God Mountain, jointly controlled by various sects.  The Witch God Mountain I refer to is our race's sacred mountain. As long as enough spirit stones are paid, anyone of any cultivation level or identity, even humans, can use it."</p><p>Manager Bai paused, then looked at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist, did someone persuade you to hunt demons in the Stormy Demon Sea? Let me advise you, the Stormy Demon Sea is incredibly dangerous, filled with countless demonic beasts.  Our two races, working together, can only occupy a few islands, barely maintaining a foothold, and these are frequently overrun by beast tides. Whether humans hunt demons or demons hunt humans is uncertain in the Stormy Demon Sea. Countless Nascent Soul stage experts have perished there, let alone us Foundation Establishment cultivators. If you need Bloodbone Pills, just buy them with spirit stones. There's no need to risk your life in such a place."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "Are you trying to persuade me to buy Bloodbone Pills from you?"</p><p>The Witch race has conducted extensive research in insect control, creating many spirit pills that aid in the growth and even transformation of spirit insects.  The most famous of these is the Bloodbone Pill.</p><p>Bloodbone Pills are refined using the refined blood and bones of demonic beasts. Giving them to a spirit insect can increase its chances of transformation. The higher the level of the demonic beast, the more effective the Bloodbone Pill.</p><p>It is said that top-grade Bloodbone Pills even contain undiminished spiritual demon cores!</p><p>The effect of Bloodbone Pills is similar to the Foundation Establishment Pills and auxiliary Nascent Soul cultivation aids most familiar to cultivators in the Little Cold Region.</p><p>Although the Canglang Sea region has scarce resources, the abundance of demonic beasts in the Stormy Demon Sea is beyond the comprehension of cultivators in the Little Cold Region.</p><p>Demons beasts are their cultivation resources.</p><p>The Witch race has developed a different approach with Bloodbone Pills.</p><p>However, although Bloodbone Pills are effective, they cannot be given to spirit insects excessively.</p><p>A spirit insect, also known as a blood insect, is nurtured with refined blood.  The more refined blood the spirit insect consumes, the more it's influenced by violent煞 energy, becoming more ferocious and violent, making it more prone to turning on its master.</p><p>Bloodbone Pills, refined with demonic bones, blood, and even cores, contain even more violent煞 energy. Spirit insects that consume them are extremely susceptible to influence, increasing the likelihood of turning on their master, even for those with the Witch race's inherent talent.</p><p>Upon learning of the Bloodbone Pill's existence, Qin Sang initially thought he could use it to directly push his spirit insect to its third transformation.</p><p>After further inquiries, he learned that he couldn't recklessly feed his spirit insect Bloodbone Pills.</p><p>He himself wasn't afraid of the backlash, but if his spirit insect was controlled by violent煞 energy, it would become extremely frenzied, completely losing its intelligence, and might even self-destruct.</p><p>This soul-linked insect larva is utterly useless to its owner.</p><p>Manager Bai nodded nonchalantly, leaning closer, and said mysteriously, "If you have enough spirit stones, I can get you a top-grade Blood Bone Pill,  Manager Bai can help you with that.  The price, however… "</p><p>Manager Bai paused, giving Qin Sang a knowing glance.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Having searched extensively in the Xiao Han region for demon cores to refine Flying Night Rakshasas, he knew the value of such cores.</p><p>While the Cang Lang Sea has more demonic beasts than Xiao Han, hunting down large demonic beasts with demon cores is equally difficult.  Demon core prices remain high, thus the price of a top-grade Blood Bone Pill is astronomical.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, exchanging pleasantries with Manager Bai, while internally planning his trip to the Storm Demon Sea.</p><p>Since cultivating the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter," Qin Sang's destiny is intertwined with slaughter.  While others fear the Storm Demon Sea like a tiger, he must go there to comprehend the killing talismans.</p><p>After forming his Golden Core, Qin Sang spent several months in the Western Frontier searching for the ancient teleportation array and the soul-linked insect larva, making no progress in cultivation due to a lack of combat experience.</p><p>The Storm Demon Sea trip is unavoidable.</p><p>"I hope Cui Xuanzi and the others have a surprise for me,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Before his departure, he instructed Cui Xuanzi and his men to organize his cultivators to search a thousand-li radius around Xiong Mountain to help him find it.</p><p>Of course, knowing the importance of the ancient teleportation array, he didn't mention it to anyone, only telling them to search for a hidden realm.</p><p>If they still couldn't find it, Qin Sang would temporarily put it aside and focus on his cultivation, seeking it again once he became stronger.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knows little about Witch God Mountain, and he's considering whether to go directly to the Storm Demon Sea from there, or first visit a human settlement to experience the local customs and then head to the Storm Demon Sea.</p><p>It is said that in the Storm Demon Sea, human and witch cultivators must cooperate to survive; the pressure from the demonic beasts forces them to set aside their differences and work together.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang put away the jade slip.</p><p>None of the people listed matched the description of Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>"How many of the spirit insects I requested have you found?"</p><p>Manager Bai shook his head. "After you left, I took a closer look at the list of spirit insects you gave me. They're all incredibly high-potential insects!  It's clear you have great ambitions! However, these insects are rare and difficult to catch. They are not commonly found in the Western Frontier…"</p>
