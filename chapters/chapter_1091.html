<h1>Chapter 183: Seed of the Fire Lotus</h1><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>A dragon's roar shook the heavens.  King Jiao had, at some point, revealed his true form, a colossal dragon. Chains formed of Demonic Qi were deeply embedded in his flesh. King Jiao hadn't been this battered in a long time. His incredibly powerful draconic body was easily wounded by Mo Qingzhu.  Each chain was like the sharpest of blades.</p><p>Scales shattered, blood flowed freely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Golden light erupted from King Jiao, every scale gleaming brilliantly as he resisted the Demonic Qi.  Some chains shattered, others were severed by the golden light, but countless more surged forward relentlessly, burrowing into his flesh like a tenacious plague.</p><p>The invasive Demonic Qi sliced through his dragon scales, forcing pained groans from King Jiao. He felt utterly frustrated. If Mo Qingzhu wasn't so fast, he wouldn't be in this predicament, cornered in an instant.  He retaliated fiercely, conjuring the illusion of a golden dragon.</p><p>This was a secret technique inherited through the Jiao Dragon lineage, its power previously witnessed by Ling Zhuzi and the others. But upon seeing the golden dragon illusion, Mo Qingzhu's crimson eyes remained unmoved, his gaze icy. He clenched his fist.</p><p>Knowing he was outmatched, King Jiao struggled desperately, his dragon claw clutching the Heavenly Phoenix Plume, desperately urging its power.  The crimson barrier was about to be pierced by flames.</p><p>But Mo Qingzhu was too fast. Before the golden dragon illusion could fully materialize, it was shredded by Demonic Qi, shattering into fragments.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Chains tightly bound King Jiao, twisting his body, dislocating bones, and stagnating the True Essence within him. The Heavenly Phoenix Plume dimmed.</p><p>Demonic Qi and chains surged like specters towards the dragon claw gripping the plume. Mo Qingzhu had seen through King Jiao's plan; he too sought the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A tremendous explosion.</p><p>The dragon claw was ripped apart, flesh and bone separated, twisted grotesquely. King Jiao lost his grip on the treasure.</p><p>The flames died out.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume slipped free!</p><p>In that instant, the Heavenly Phoenix Plume became the center of everyone's attention. Grand Sorcerer, Old Demon Fang, the Demon Lord, and Ling Zhuzi, four apex cultivators whose strength rivaled King Jiao’s, lunged for it simultaneously.</p><p>With a gentle flick of his wrist, Ling Zhuzi's horsetail whisk transformed into a shower of stardust, locking down the surrounding space. It was like a surging galaxy, carrying an aura of vastness, a powerful Daoist technique.</p><p>The Demon Lord merged with the divine light of the Great Yin Celestial Ghost, resembling the waters of the Yellow Springs.  He and Ling Zhuzi, one on the left and one on the right, went straight for the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>Thunder rumbled from within the Grand Sorcerer as he shot forward like lightning, a faint green silkworm phantom trailing behind, dyeing the lightning the same color. This Green Silkworm was the Grand Sorcerer's natal Gu insect, a type of spirit silkworm. However, it wasn't the legendary ancient divine silkworm of the Wu tribe, but a Spring Thunder Silkworm, ranked among the top ten Wu insects.</p><p>The Spring Thunder Silkworm chirped.  The bolts of lightning resembled fine threads spun by the silkworm, their might no less impressive than the Demon Lord's or Ling Zhuzi’s.</p><p>The most unassuming was Old Demon Fang. He didn't seem to produce any treasures, simply transforming into a streak of yellow light as he pounced towards the Heavenly Phoenix Plume, yet his speed surpassed even the Grand Sorcerer.</p><p>They were still as mountains, swift as lightning when they moved. The entire space was filled with dazzling, multicolored lights.</p><p>Qin Sang and the young girl cowered in a corner, trembling. He and Bai Du fell silent, utterly helpless in their current situation. Mo Qingzhu and the Ancient Demon's split soul were terrifyingly powerful. Even if the Demon Lord and the others joined forces wholeheartedly, their chances of victory were slim.</p><p>The appearance of the Heavenly Phoenix Plume was a double-edged sword. Those individuals clearly had other intentions now.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the battle with a tense face.  His gaze drifted towards the raised platform. On it, the blood coffin and the sword energy clashed, their power indistinguishable. The resulting shockwaves formed a terrifying storm, keeping everyone at bay.</p><p>He observed the situation with his Divine Eye while probing the Thousand Jun Ring with his divine sense, searching for any treasures that could ensure his survival.  The Three Lights Jade Liquid could heal injuries. However, in this place, any mishap meant utter annihilation, rendering the liquid likely useless.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed the lotus seed he obtained from Old Demon Mu.</p><p>The seed was transparent, like it was carved from crystal. It was the only thing left after Old Demon Mu's death. Qin Sang recalled it being hidden within the Winter Nether Cold Flame. He wondered what kind of treasure it was, considering Old Demon Mu, even gravely injured, hadn't abandoned it.</p><p>After obtaining the seed, Qin Sang had tried to examine it closely, but was interrupted by King Nine Phoenix.</p><p>"I think there was a secret technique…"</p><p>Unable to do anything else, Qin Sang summoned the lotus seed and probed it with his divine sense, a look of surprise gradually spreading across his face.</p><p>“The *Seed of the Fire Lotus*, an incredible fire manipulation technique!  It can subdue unclaimed spirit flames, condensing a fire seed within the Purple Mansion, formed by one's Nascent Soul. Cultivating this technique greatly benefits divine sense.  Old Demon Mu’s divine sense surpassed that of cultivators at the same level. No wonder he was able to escape death so many times! This lotus seed is similar to the bone flute, a vessel for the secret technique, also aiding in its cultivation and increasing the chances of success. It contains Old Demon Mu’s imprint, but since he's dead, refining it shouldn't be difficult with enough time…”</p><p>…</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Plume fell.</p><p>King Jiao's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>But Mo Qingzhu's displayed power filled him with even greater despair.</p><p>Just then, the Demon Lord and the others arrived, all fixated on the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of green light arrived before them.  The Demon Subduing Stele, having saved the Nine Lives Black Tortoise, rushed to seize the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>But someone was even faster.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic Qi swirled around the Heavenly Phoenix Plume.</p><p>Suppressing King Jiao’s resistance, a flicker of mockery crossed Mo Qingzhu’s crimson eyes. He was about to claim the Heavenly Phoenix Plume, completely cutting off any hope for the others.</p><p>‘Buzz!’</p><p>Fairy Nangui and her companion unleashed the full power of the Demon Subduing Stele.</p><p>The Demonic Qi seethed and crackled. The stele was inherently designed to counter Ancient Demons. The green light tore through the Demonic Qi like a scythe, transforming into a sharp blade that slashed towards Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu remained undaunted. With a wave of his arm, a torrent of Demonic Qi surged forward, forming layers upon layers of curtains, an unending assault meant to erode the green light.</p><p>Even the Demon Subduing Stele couldn't deter Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Just as the Heavenly Phoenix Plume was about to fall into Mo Qingzhu's hands, a flicker of crimson light flashed in his eyes, and he roared in rage and surprise, “You dare!”</p><p>A ripple of instability ran through Mo Qingzhu's aura, destabilizing the Demonic Qi. Within him, Qingzhu's true soul hadn't been completely devoured.  He and the Sword Soul had merged, integrating with the Spirit Sword fragment.  Using the fragment as a shield, he persisted, focusing all his power to disrupt Mo Qingzhu at this crucial moment.</p><p>“Now’s our chance!”</p><p>Witnessing this, everyone cried out inwardly, overjoyed.  They didn't understand how Qingzhu managed to achieve this despite the vast difference in power, but they wouldn't miss this golden opportunity.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Demon Subduing Stele shattered the Demonic Qi.</p><p>The Nine Lives Black Tortoise snatched the Heavenly Phoenix Plume before anyone else, then retreated rapidly under the cover of Fairy Nangui and her companion.</p><p>The power disparity was too great. Qingzhu’s resistance was instantly suppressed by the demonic soul.</p><p>King Jiao also sought to escape, roaring furiously as he struggled, snapping the chains that bound him.</p>
