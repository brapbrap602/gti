<h1>Chapter 444: A Matter of Life and Death, and a Game</h1><p>As far as the eye could see, numerous islands dotted the waters. Many were already claimed, with houses built upon them.</p><p>Most were simple wooden structures, or earth-and-stone houses formed with spells.</p><p>Of course, there were also exquisitely crafted pavilions and flowing streams, obviously meticulously designed, but these were rare. After all, the cultivators were summoned here to fight, not to enjoy themselves.</p><p>At the very center of all the islands was a most striking large island, the new Stargazing Island, formed by Shepo merging dozens of smaller islands.</p><p>Shepo and a group of Golden Core cultivators' caves were located on Stargazing Island and nearby islands.</p><p>With Stargazing Island as the center, the righteous and demonic cultivators of the Foundation Establishment stage were clearly divided, with the righteous cultivators mostly gathering on the west side and the demonic cultivators on the east, mirroring the layout of the Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>As more and more Xiaohan Domain cultivators were summoned here, the differences between the righteous and demonic paths grew, and even with war looming, they couldn't set aside their prejudices.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's biggest question.</p><p>Neither the Xiaohan Domain nor the Tianxing Alliance seemed determined to prepare for war and fight to the death.</p><p>Three years ago, when both sides first confronted each other in this water area, they lacked manpower and their spirit formations were unstable, leading to several very fierce battles.</p><p>Both sides summoned cultivators, engaging in multiple large-scale battles involving thousands of cultivators in the outer mists.  At the most critical moment, Qin Sang and others were forced to flee into the mist, and the newly formed True Water Thousand Illusions Formation was nearly breached.</p><p>Of course, there were also times when the Xiaohan Domain side had a significant advantage, pursuing the enemy all the way to the Taiqing Lake area, almost leveling the lake.</p><p>Qin Sang considered that period the most dangerous, but luckily, with the backing of his sect and the company of his fellow disciples, he survived.</p><p>Overall, the two sides were evenly matched.</p><p>Especially after the formation was fully completed, both sides relied on their respective formations, establishing a firm footing, neither able to overcome the other, leading to a stalemate.</p><p>It must be remembered that the Xiaohan Domain was fighting on two fronts: the Ancient Immortal battlefield was experiencing frequent anomalies and cloud beasts were rampaging, forcing the Xiaohan Domain to keep sufficient forces to guard the Seven Heroes Pass.</p><p>Those sent to the Yun Cang Great Marsh did not represent the full strength of the Xiaohan Domain, yet they were still evenly matched against the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>From this, it can be seen that, if not constrained by the spiritual tide from the Ancient Immortal battlefield, the Xiaohan Domain's overall strength would surpass the Tianxing Alliance, but before the signs of the spiritual tide appeared, the Xiaohan Domain did not take the initiative to invade the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>The situation remains the same now. After Stargazing Island moved to the chaotic island waters, it has not advanced further. Qin Sang feels no aggressive posture from the Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>In this stalemate, fighting never ceased, but neither side launched an all-out attack. Large-scale battles involving thousands of cultivators were rare.</p><p>Between the Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing Alliance, a strange tacit understanding seemed to have formed. They only sent out their Foundation Establishment cultivators, forming teams to patrol this vast water area and hunt each other.</p><p>Their orders were vague—to patrol and report any unusual spatial fluctuations, with a substantial reward promised.</p><p>However, the nature of these fluctuations was never specified.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators of both sides were not immune either, engaging in skirmishes every ten days or so. Fortunately, the battles remained largely on the same level, with little bullying of the weak by the strong.</p><p>Qin Sang was very interested in the battles between Golden Core cultivators. He needed to assess their strength, so whenever possible, he tried to observe them.</p><p>While not as spectacular as the battle between the Thunder Swallowing Falcon and the two Nascent Soul cultivators, the battles between Golden Core cultivators were still terrifying and had a wide impact. Observation required caution to avoid being caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Over the past three years, ensuring his own safety, Qin Sang had observed several battles and had gained some understanding of the strength of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Their strength was indeed formidable, with clear differences between early, middle, and late stages.</p><p>Besides cultivation, magic treasures were also an important standard for measuring the strength of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>A mysterious, high-quality magic treasure could give a cultivator a significant advantage in battle, making their opponent struggle and even offsetting cultivation differences.</p><p>However, mid-grade and above magic treasures were very rare. Over 90% of the magic treasures Qin Sang had seen were low-grade, comparable to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang's judgment might be limited by his cultivation level, and his conclusions might not be entirely accurate.</p><p>In Qin Sang's opinion, the battles between Golden Core cultivators resembled more of a series of duels.</p><p>Most battles end with one side suffering serious injuries and fleeing. Even in the fiercest confrontations, it's only the physical body that's lost; the soul and golden core escape.  In short, none of the Golden Core cultivators Qin Sang observed during the battles actually died.</p><p>As for the Yuan Ying powerhouses from both sides, they haven't appeared since the war began.  Xiao Han Region and the Tian Xing League seem to be waiting for a specific moment.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling, perhaps a misconception, that what seemed like a life-or-death crisis to others was merely a game for these high-level cultivators.</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, shaking his head slightly. After flying out of the fog, he determined his direction and steered his cloud across the chaotic islands, landing on an inconspicuous islet.</p><p>The islet was square, flat, and barren, devoid of vegetation—a large, dark-green reef. Unfortunately, it was only about seven feet square. A stone hut had been built on it, leaving little room for anything else.</p><p>For the waters of the chaotic islands, this was considered a very small island. Yet Qin Sang had lived there for three years.</p><p>The stone hut was his cave dwelling.</p><p>After opening the cave's protective formation and confirming no one had entered, Qin Sang went inside, skillfully sealing the formation. Then he took several spirit stones from his storage pouch and placed them in various locations within the cave.</p><p>As the spirit stones were inserted into the ground, they emitted a clear, ringing sound.  A faint glow from the spirit array illuminated the cave, and the spiritual energy within gradually thickened.  Simultaneously, the spirit stones slowly dimmed, a sign of their energy being depleted.</p><p>The chaotic island waters were originally very poor in spiritual energy, with only a hidden spirit vein occupied by Pei Qin.  It's unknown what method Stargazing Island used, but after the True Water Thousand Illusions Formation covered the waters, the spiritual energy improved, though it still wasn't sufficient for so many cultivators to practice.</p><p>Under these circumstances, no one dared to place their cave dwelling outside the True Water Thousand Illusions Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's cave dwelling was in a relatively good location, but even so, the spiritual energy was still quite thin for his cultivation level, requiring him to use spirit stones to supplement his practice.</p><p>This made cultivation quite costly, but Qin Sang had adapted.</p><p>He even found a certain pleasure in it.</p><p>The spoils from battling and killing enemies were all his, easily covering his cultivation costs.  Qin Sang didn't stint on spirit stones, setting up the best spirit gathering array to maximize the spiritual energy in his cave. His sole purpose was to cultivate as quickly as possible and reach the False Core realm.</p>
