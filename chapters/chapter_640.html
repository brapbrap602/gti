<h1>Chapter 632: Courage</h1><p>Qin Sang handed over the Cold Gold Sword, explaining to Ya Gu the true purpose of Yi Hui Village's selection of the Sacred Maiden. He then looked into her eyes, waiting for her decision.</p><p>Cultivation is not a dinner party.</p><p>Qin Sang could repay Ya Gu's life-saving grace by empowering her, giving her the ability to control her own destiny, but he couldn't protect her forever.</p><p>His own future was uncertain, and he had many pressing matters to attend to. Once he left, he likely wouldn't return.</p><p>Facing enemies who wanted to refine them into pills, if Ya Gu didn't even have the courage to take up a sword for revenge, then even with power, she would be a toothless tiger, only inviting disaster.</p><p>Heaven helps those who help themselves.</p><p>If Ya Gu didn't dare to take the sword, Qin Sang would consider finding a safe place for her, allowing her to live a life of wealth and prosperity, away from the treacherous world of martial arts. Perhaps, that would be a good thing for her.</p><p>Refining humans into medicine to feed insects and gu.  The cruelty of the cultivation world was forcibly torn open by Qin Sang, revealing the tip of the iceberg to Ya Gu.</p><p>In this world, even if a Witch God truly existed, there were no Witch God Envoys.  They were just cultivators who had mastered powerful forces, using the name of the Witch God to enslave others.</p><p>Ya Gu was stunned.</p><p>Her deeply ingrained beliefs of over a decade were shattered by Qin Sang, revealing the bloody truth.</p><p>Red candles flickered, filling the room with fragrance.</p><p>A brazier warmed the room, but Ya Gu was shivering.  Her face was drained of color, her lips tightly bitten.  Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, she seemed to understand his meaning. Finally, she summoned the courage to raise her hands and reach for the Cold Gold Sword.</p><p>Her hands trembled, but she gripped the hilt tightly.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "We are just people with the talent for cultivation.  Outside, we are called cultivators. We have nothing to do with the Witch God. We are not divine envoys, just mortals who have mastered powerful forces. We can die just like anyone else. Thinking about it this way, do you still feel awe?  Moreover, as long as one has a spiritual root, one can cultivate. You can also become a cultivator."</p><p>"Me?"</p><p>Ya Gu's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had discovered that Ya Gu also possessed a spiritual root. Unfortunately, it was a four-element root, slightly better than his, but still limited. Both were considered inferior roots.</p><p>Unless she had a great opportunity, her path to immortality was destined to be hopeless.</p><p>However, since she possessed a spiritual root, Ya Gu was qualified to enter the cultivation world, and a new world would open up to her.</p><p>She dared to take the flying sword, indicating that beneath her fragile exterior lay a resilient heart. Otherwise, she wouldn't still yearn for beauty after enduring such hardship.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to follow his original plan and teach her a cultivation method to help her change her fate.</p><p>With a four-element root of metal, wood, water, and fire, she could cultivate any technique except earth.</p><p>Qin Sang had perused the treasures of Treasure Pagoda Peak, learning not only many foundational Qi Refining techniques but also some inheritances leading directly to the Nascent Soul realm. Some included the Qi Refining stage, allowing for continuous cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered what technique to teach Ya Gu.  After a moment of thought, he recalled one that might be suitable for her:  Elder Di Que's "Heaven Shaking Demonic Sound."</p><p>"Heaven Shaking Demonic Sound" used sound as its path, a rather unique approach.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Elder Di Que's various methods from the ancient cultivator's ruins, including disguise, illusion, and sealing talismans â€“ all mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>"Heaven Shaking Demonic Sound" was one of Qin Sang's backup techniques for after forming his Gold Core. Now that he had Senior Qing Zhu's self-created technique, he no longer needed it.</p><p>Ya Gu's voice was her greatest asset. In a way, it was as rare as having a Heaven or dual-element spiritual root.</p><p>Could this talent be helpful in cultivating the "Heaven Shaking Demonic Sound"?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't cultivate the technique himself, so he couldn't be sure, but it was worth a try.</p><p>The path of cultivation was about seizing every possibility.</p><p>"Close your eyes."</p><p>Qin Sang extended a finger, touching Ya Gu's forehead, transmitting the complete "Heaven Shaking Demonic Sound" to her.</p><p>To prevent Ya Gu from being overwhelmed, the realms beyond Foundation Establishment were sealed by Qin Sang with restrictions. Once Ya Gu reached a certain level of cultivation and her divine sense grew stronger, she could unlock them herself.</p><p>Suddenly having so much new knowledge in her mind, Ya Gu's eyes were dazed and bewildered. It took her a long time to understand what they were, and she could only memorize them vaguely for now.</p><p>"I'll guide you on how to cultivate.  You will avenge your own grievance."</p><p>Qin Sang said, then began to guide Ya Gu's cultivation, also teaching her the "Scripture of Purity and Stillness."</p><p>It had taken him a long time to grasp the basics on his own back then.  With his personal guidance, Ya Gu would avoid many detours and quickly enter a state of tranquility.</p><p>Then, with the aid of a few medicinal pills, she would soon be able to sense Qi.</p><p>...</p><p>The Witch God Festival was approaching.</p><p>On the eve of the festival, Yi Hui Village would hold a grand sacrificial ceremony.</p><p>The Sacred Maiden would offer flowers, sending them into the Divine Cave.</p><p>Heavenly rain would fall, a blessing from the Witch God.</p><p>On the surface, it was a scene of peace and harmony. Everyone hoped to receive the Witch God's favor, praying for good fortune in the coming year.</p><p>A few days before the Witch God Festival, people from the surrounding villages began arriving from the Qingyi River, gathering at Yi Hui Village.</p><p>The mountains east of Yi Hui Village were crowded, mostly with young men and women.  Garlanded maidens and strong young men were everywhere.</p><p>Twilight fell, and the bright moon hung high.</p><p>Bonfires were lit on the mountainsides, and men and women sang and danced, praising the Witch God, filling the air with laughter and joy.</p><p>On the lakeshore where Yi Hui Village stood, a tall altar was built from beast bones, with protruding bone spurs and adorned with various ferocious beast skulls, painted with twisting patterns in blood.</p><p>Torches were planted on the altar, offerings arranged, and Yi Hui Village guards, adorned with ribbons and large drums, formed a procession.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The first drumbeat sounded, and the dancing men and women fell silent, kneeling devoutly towards the altar.</p><p>A beautiful woman emerged from Yi Hui Village, ascending the altar step by step.</p><p>This woman was also a priestess of Yi Hui Village.  She wore colorful robes woven from various bird feathers, extremely ornate. The patterns tattooed on her face were also exceptionally intricate.</p><p>Standing on the high altar, the Priestess looked up at the starry sky, her eyes holding a dreamlike quality, as if praying to the gods, murmuring incantations.</p><p>Suddenly, the Priestess raised her arms high, facing the bright moon, as if holding a silver platter.</p><p>Then, her hands slammed down!</p><p>Below the altar, the guards, who had been raising their drumsticks and gathering strength, also struck their drums at this moment.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The unified drumbeats stirred the blood, shaking the mountains and rivers.</p><p>Accompanied by the drums, the Priestess danced on the high platform, her movements incredibly alluring, her dance strange but full of power, matching the rhythm of the drums.</p><p>Gradually, the Priestess's movements became faster and faster, her limbs almost a blur, like a serpent in a frenzy, yet possessing a bizarre beauty.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang watched the Priestess dancing on the altar, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>The Priestess was performing a very ancient witch dance.</p><p>As the Priestess danced, Qin Sang sensed a strange power emanating from her, a power that seemed to originate from the tattoos on her body.</p>
