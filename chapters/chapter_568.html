Chapter 561: Above the Ninth Heaven, the Celestial Palace Appears


Ahead was a swirling vortex of wind and clouds.
Behind, countless spatial fissures.
They paused briefly, then descended, flying almost parallel to the sandy ground.  The vortex swirled above them; their target lay deep within its heart.
Approaching the vortex, they realized its surface calm belied its true nature.
The clouds within flowed like an ocean, though slowly. Their density was extreme, uniform, without impurities—a single entity, its true nature hidden from afar.
Within the seemingly calm vortex, a terrifying power brewed.
If the vortex collapsed, everyone present would perish, even the Yuan Ying cultivators!
Qin Sang suppressed his unease, gazing upward at the clouds.
Judging by the movements of the powerful Yuan Ying cultivators, the Ziwei Palace surely lay within the vortex.  But their vision was completely blocked by the clouds; they couldn't see past it.
Qin Sang couldn't tell if this power emanated from the vortex itself, or from the celestial array sealing the Ziwei Palace deep within.


While Qin Sang pondered, the Red Cloud suddenly stopped again.
They were now near the vortex's core.  Streams of clouds intertwined before them, forming a massive whirlpool. At its deepest point, the eye of the storm, seemed a large void.  But from their position, they couldn't see what lay within.


Time passed; they had been stationary for over two hours.
The four-colored cloud formations and warships remained motionless. Everyone waited, the Yuan Ying cultivators similarly inactive, their purpose unknown.
Qin Sang glanced around.
Dongyang Bo stood on the edge of the Red Cloud, not far away.
Tieguanzi, Chenyan, Master Fengming, and the others, clearly in the know, remained calmly seated, cultivating.
Yunyouzi stayed close to his master, making open communication impossible. Qin Sang approached Qiu Mu Bai, seeking answers.
Ji Qing and the others, equally curious about the Ziwei Palace, drew closer.
“The entrance to the Ziwei Palace is in the eye of the storm.”
Qiu Mu Bai, indeed informed, pointed to the void, whispering, “The Ziwei Palace won't appear yet.  When an anomaly appears in the eye, the Palace will emerge, the celestial array will weaken, and we'll have a chance to use one array to break another and enter.  We're just waiting for the moment… it shouldn't be long.”


He glanced at Qin Sang.
“The spirit array used to break the Ziwei Palace’s celestial array is called the Lesser Beichen Star Yuan Array. It's the safest method developed over years of experimentation by countless predecessors. Other arrays offer a chance of success, but no guarantee. Some attempts have even triggered counterattacks from the celestial array, resulting in massive losses.
“Deploying the Lesser Beichen Star Yuan Array requires countless rare spiritual materials, plus a crucial artifact: the Star Yuan Stone, only found on Zhitian Peak.
“Zhitian Peak's spatial structure is fragile; only a small number of stones can be harvested each time before it collapses completely.  Furthermore, Zhitian Peak constantly drifts in the Yun Cang Great Marsh, its location unpredictable; neither region can claim it permanently.
“Therefore, the two regions agreed to jointly manage Zhitian Peak, opening it only before the Ziwei Palace's emergence to harvest stones for the array. This later evolved into one of the two regions’ gambling grounds.
“Incidentally, we cultivators of the Xiao Han Region owe you a debt of gratitude, Qin Shixiong.
“Your crucial role in that gambling match secured a victory for us.  Otherwise, we would have had to prepare the array materials ourselves—a considerable sum.
“Therefore, your winning the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris is well-deserved.”


Star Yuan Stones, Zhitian Peak…
Qin Sang suddenly understood.  He’d suspected some of this, but Qiu Mu Bai's explanation clarified everything.
That gambling match had been connected to the Lesser Beichen Star Yuan Array!  The reward from Stargazing Island was incredibly stingy!
However, Qin Sang reflected that the number of Star Yuan Stones harvested from Zhitian Peak depended less on strength and morale and more on luck.
The Star Spirit Net Jing Po Po gave him was the only exception.
He still possessed the net; Jing Po Po hadn't reclaimed it.
If he used it to cheat in every match, Xiao Han Region would always win, but the Tianxing Alliance would likely notice anomalies after a couple of times.


After learning the truth, Qin Sang and the others ceased their impatience and waited patiently.


Unexpectedly, they waited for more than six hours.

Half a day passed before the cyclone finally showed signs of change.  A thunderous roar erupted from the eye of the storm. The swirling clouds accelerated, their movement now clearly visible.

Amidst the rumbling, the entire cyclone began to rotate slowly. A powerful suction force emerged from the eye, rapidly drawing in the surrounding clouds. It was as if a bottomless pit existed in the heavens, consuming clouds endlessly.

As more and more clouds vanished, the void in the eye expanded. Its edges began to dissipate. The upward suction force clashed with the cyclone’s energy, creating increasing chaos.

Gale-force winds howled. Sand and stones flew.  Turbulent spiritual energy and clouds surged, causing the Skyfaring Battleship and the four-colored cloud formations to tremble violently.

Everyone watched, their eyes wide, mesmerized by the spectacle unfolding before them.  Such a sight is rarely witnessed by anyone in a lifetime, let alone from such close proximity.

The cyclone spun faster and faster, reaching its peak in less than a quarter of an hour. The eye had expanded more than tenfold.  Then, with a deafening boom, a brilliant light descended from the heavens into the very center of the eye!

The light instantly filled the eye and rapidly spread outwards.  The onlookers gaped, awestruck by the celestial display.

Through the thinning clouds, they saw layers upon layers of clouds, piling up to the highest heavens.  There, in what seemed to be the celestial palace, stood a Heavenly Gate.  

The words "Purple Micro Palace" were clearly inscribed in the center of the gate, exactly as depicted in the Purple Micro Scripture! However, seeing the gate in person was vastly different from the image in the scripture; the image failed to capture even a fraction of its majesty.

The heavily damaged gate bore the marks of countless years.  A sense of immense age and profound desolation washed over them as they gazed upon it.

The Purple Micro Palace gate stood alone in the clouds, its former splendor long gone.  Not even ruins remained, only the damaged gate itself. Yet, it stood firm, the words "Purple Micro Palace" still shining brightly—a testament to the celestial palace, a silent narrator of its glorious past.
