<h1>Chapter 2032: Shared Bounty</h1><p>“Gao!”</p><p>The incantation’s sound, resonant as thunder, reverberated within Qin Sang's heart. Suppressing his inner shock, he immersed himself completely in the chant’s mystical rhythm.</p><p>He felt as though he had returned to the high altar atop the mountain peak, towering between heaven and earth.  Below, a shaman led the tribespeople in worship, their prayers rising to the heavens with fervent devotion.</p><p>As the incantation echoed through the myriad mountains, a fierce wind swept across the plains, sending sand and stones swirling. The twilight’s crimson glow gradually faded into the encroaching dark clouds until the last sliver of light vanished, and darkness enveloped the world.</p><p>Nightfall brought no peace to the plains, only a pervasive sense of unease. The wild beasts ceased their howls, restlessly pawing at the earth. Smaller creatures scurried back to their burrows, trembling in fear.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing shriek echoed across the plains, followed by the roar of a predator. The cries triggered utter chaos.</p><p>In the darkness, the torches surrounding the altar became the sole source of light. Bathed in their glow, the mountain resembled a sacred peak, a conduit between heaven and earth. Countless beasts fought and died in the surrounding darkness, yet none dared approach the mountain.  As the incantation grew louder, they seemed gripped by a primal fear etched into their very souls, desperately fleeing outwards.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The wind gathered more dark clouds. The torches flickered violently, yet their light stubbornly illuminated the altar.</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>Above the clouds, lightning danced, and the rolling thunder seemed to echo the incantation, a response from the heavens themselves.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Torrential rain poured down. The figures below the altar remained motionless beneath the deluge.  The incantation intensified, and the shaman ascended the steps, dancing alone, his movements filled with power.</p><p>The torches were extinguished, but amidst the lightning and thunder, flashes of light etched his silhouette into Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed ritual dances before.  The Ghost Mother performed one during her ascension. This was different. He desperately yearned to see clearly, but the more he strained, the more blurred the vision became, reminding him that this was not reality.</p><p>Scenes, illusory yet vividly real, unfolded within Qin Sang's mind.  As the ritual reached its crescendo, the incantation merged with the thunder, and the combined might of wind, rain, and lightning converged above the altar.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt his body shatter, exploding into countless minute particles.  He ascended involuntarily, merging with the wind and rain, the clouds and lightning, becoming one with the natural world.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Resounding booms echoed within his heart, as if he had touched the very pulse of heaven and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to ponder the source of these sounds. In this moment, he sensed a powerful presence.</p><p>As vast as the heavens, as profound as the earth.</p><p>As he drew closer to this presence, it felt like returning to a mother's embrace, infinitely warm and comforting, urging him to forget everything, to merge completely.</p><p>He sensed this unknown presence, and at the same time, he felt a strange energy permeating the void. Every particle of his being was bathed in this power.</p><p>The energy itself was dense and rich, but upon contact with Qin Sang, it erupted into a frenzy, like a tsunami engulfing the ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body became a sponge, frantically absorbing the surrounding energy. Each particle was like a hungry lamb, greedily devouring the power.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang instinctively circulated his core cultivation technique, the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*. His cultivation base began to soar, and he lost himself in the blissful sensation.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>An unknown amount of time later, Qin Sang suddenly awoke. He immediately realized that his cultivation had dramatically increased.</p><p>After his enlightenment at Moonfall Bay, his path forward had become clear.  All he lacked was the accumulation of cultivation, and this chant had provided a shortcut.</p><p>The shamanistic incantation was miraculous, a power beyond Qin Sang's comprehension. He hadn’t experienced the pain of forced empowerment like he had in the Talisman World, yet his cultivation had genuinely risen, as naturally as flowing water.</p><p>But at this precise moment, Qin Sang sensed a subtle discord.</p><p>The energy remained vast; he hadn't absorbed it all.</p><p>Yet, whether because he wasn't a descendant of the Witch Tribe and couldn't fully resonate with the chant, or for some other reason, after he awoke, the discord grew increasingly pronounced.  Abnormal fluctuations constantly bombarded him, causing a flicker of unease within Qin Sang.  He felt as though he was being expelled.</p><p>His heart sank.  Such opportunities were rare and fleeting.  The longer he could endure, the greater the benefits. He had to grit his teeth and persevere.</p><p>Others, their minds overwhelmed by the incantation, could only passively endure, awakening only at the moment of expulsion, too late for any remedy.</p><p>Thanks to the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang remained composed. He noticed the Celestial Eye Butterfly within his sea of Qi was also restless, experiencing the same phenomenon.  The butterfly's cultivation had also increased, a remarkable feat considering its recent breakthrough and the incomplete absorption of its tribulation gains.</p><p>Even a spirit insect could benefit. Such a miraculous chant!</p><p>The discord was still nascent; it wasn't too late to mend the situation. Qin Sang consciously began experimenting, adjusting himself, resisting the expelling force, and guiding the Celestial Eye Butterfly to prolong the duration of this state.</p><p>His efforts bore fruit.</p><p>After a period, both he and the Celestial Eye Butterfly, who should have been expelled, persisted.</p><p>Finally, the limit was reached. The repelling waves surged like a raging storm, and Qin Sang relinquished his hold.</p><p>In an instant, all illusions vanished, and reality returned.  He slowly opened his eyes and immediately saw the cracked doorway of the stone hall.</p><p>Beyond the door lay only darkness, devoid of any light.</p><p>Glancing around, he saw Luo Hou, Gui Hou, the Fire Jade Centipede, and the Vermillion Bird sprawled in various positions.</p><p>They had withdrawn from the incantation’s influence earlier but had also shared in the bounty, reaping considerable benefits. They were now fully absorbed in consolidating their gains.</p><p>Of the two demon lords, Gui Hou, whose cultivation was originally higher, had seized the opportunity to shatter a bottleneck, breaking through to late-stage Nascent Soul.  Luo Hou had reached the peak of mid-stage Nascent Soul and would likely make another breakthrough after assimilating his gains.</p><p>Although the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't broken through to the late stage of its fifth transformation, its cultivation had noticeably increased.  It remained to be seen whether it could surpass the limitations of its species.</p><p>Relatively speaking, the Vermillion Bird had made the least progress.  Its cultivation remained stagnant at the peak of Nascent Soul, a testament to the difficulty of reaching the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang and the Celestial Eye Butterfly had benefited the most.</p><p>Qin Sang, having persevered the longest, had the highest cultivation and the greatest capacity to withstand the expelling force.  Coupled with his continuous adjustments, he had achieved astonishing gains from the chant.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned by his own progress.  Once he digested these gains, he might not be far from mid-stage Void Refinement!</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly had relinquished its hold earlier than Qin Sang, so its gains were lesser, but it still saved a tremendous amount of time and energy.</p><p>Qin Sang inspected his inner world.  Gaining power not inherently his own inevitably resulted in a slightly unstable foundation, but it was far better than his state after receiving Lei Zu’s empowerment.</p><p>Temporarily stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang shifted his gaze to Young Mistress Xin.</p><p>He saw her seated in mid-air, having also broken through to the peak of Nascent Soul thanks to the incantation. Perhaps due to her connection with the runestone, she was still immersed in the chant's influence.</p><p>At this moment, her true essence surged like a tide, repeatedly assaulting the bottleneck to the next realm.</p><p>If she truly broke through to Void Refinement in one fell swoop, it would be utterly astounding!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. He couldn’t deny that without Young Mistress Xin’s invitation, he would have missed this opportunity and likely never have another chance to restore the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>The facts proved that Young Mistress Xin hadn't lied earlier.  After some thought, Qin Sang waved his hand, releasing the restrictions on her, then flashed to the front of the hall.</p><p>Peering through the crack, he observed the scene within.</p><p>Surprisingly, the hall was empty, save for a few stone pillars and a large stone throne, resembling a royal seat. On the back of the throne was a circular depression, within which a raised, orchid-like bas-relief mirrored the design on the door.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the door open and entered.  He detected nothing unusual. The hall seemed to contain only the remnants of the chant.</p><p>After circling the interior without any discoveries, Qin Sang exited the hall and surveyed his surroundings.  With the stone hall’s emergence, the five-colored radiance had vanished, and the depths of the formation showed no further activity.</p><p>He then flew to other locations, retrieving the remaining fragments one by one. The space within the Thousand Jun Ring gradually expanded until it became a pocket dimension a hundred miles in diameter!</p><p>Now, carrying the Thousand Jun Ring was equivalent to carrying a small pocket dimension.</p><p>The spiritual energy within the dimension was somewhat thin, insufficient for Qin Sang's cultivation.  Aside from its spaciousness and the option of seeking refuge within it during emergencies, it didn't seem particularly useful. He wondered if it would improve after the dimension was fully restored.</p><p>Moreover, he still didn't know how to restore it.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Thousand Jun Ring, examining it repeatedly, hoping the internal dimension would recover on its own, though he knew it would likely be a lengthy process.</p><p>Returning to the stone hall, Qin Sang observed Young Mistress Xin's aura receding. It appeared she had reached her limit and ultimately failed to break through to Void Refinement.</p><p>Before she regained consciousness, Qin Sang recalled Luo Hou and the other demons into his cauldron.</p><p>The restrictions broken, the stone hall lost its mystical properties, becoming ordinary stone.  Qin Sang experimented and successfully stored the entire hall within the Thousand Jun Ring without destabilizing the space.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin's eyelids fluttered, and she slowly awoke. Seeing the empty space before her, she was momentarily bewildered.</p><p>“You’re awake,” Qin Sang’s voice came from behind her.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin quickly turned, seeing Qin Sang facing away from her, gazing towards the entrance of the formation. She also noticed the restrictions on her had been lifted.</p><p>She observed that Qin Sang's aura was slightly fluctuating, unlike its previous stability.  Her expression relaxed slightly as she said, “Elder Qin, you should believe me now. This junior spoke no falsehoods.”</p><p>“Where is the secret realm your father mentioned?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin immediately understood his meaning.  “It’s also within the Abundant Desolation Jade Gate. If Senior has time, shall we proceed there now?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  He didn't mention any reward, his attitude speaking volumes.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin flew to his side, remaining half a step behind, and together they looked at the storm of destruction.</p><p>Judging by the situation, it would be some time before they could leave.</p><p>“Tell me how you discovered this place,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Years ago, this junior encountered a rogue lightning burst and sought shelter.  By chance, I stumbled upon this area.  The rogue lightning caused fluctuations in the external shimmering lights, and this junior realized there was something hidden within.  After the rogue lightning subsided, I returned and discovered this tomb.  It was also fortunate that the runestone was discarded carelessly on the platform outside the tomb, allowing this junior to activate it with a blood oath.  Otherwise, this junior might not have even been able to unlock the first restriction on the door…”</p><p>Young Mistress Xin quietly recounted her tale and produced the items she had previously obtained here for Qin Sang's inspection.</p><p>She then briefly described the Xin family's situation, as well as the environments surrounding Cultivator Pei and Cultivator Zhong Liang’s cultivation grounds. However, Qin Sang didn't express an opinion.</p><p>Finally, the storm of destruction began to wane.</p><p>Once the outside was less perilous, the two approached the storm.  Inside, it was a chaotic void, devoid of any cultivator’s presence. Cultivator Pei and Cultivator Zhong Liang were obliterated, not even a trace remained, and their treasures were lost.</p><p>Two dignified Void Refinement experts, now companions on the road to the Yellow Springs. They probably never imagined they would fall at the hands of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“Young Mistress!”</p><p>“Elder Qin?”</p><p>When Qin Sang and Young Mistress Xin emerged from the formation, Steward Luo and the others were waiting anxiously outside.</p><p>Not all of the Xin family cultivators had made it out; casualties were inevitable. Steward Luo and the Xin family’s Grand Elder, both privy to the plan, had already accepted the possibility of sacrificing themselves, even preparing for the complete annihilation of their group.</p><p>Seeing Young Mistress Xin not only safe and sound but her cultivation significantly advanced, they were overjoyed, then astonished.</p><p>The plan had been perfectly executed, successfully eliminating Cultivator Pei and Cultivator Zhong Liang, yet a new variable had emerged. They hadn’t seen Qin Sang for so long and assumed he had perished within, yet he had emerged with the Young Mistress.</p><p>“Why? Are you surprised to see this old man?”</p><p>Qin Sang calmly swept his gaze over the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>Their hearts jolted, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>Young Mistress Xin stepped forward and declared, “Regarding the events of today, after we leave, everyone shall swear an oath to never divulge a single word.  Otherwise, face the consequences of family law!”</p><p>Under Young Mistress Xin's sharp gaze, everyone lowered their heads and respectfully agreed.</p><p>After this incident, no one within the family would dare challenge her authority again.</p><p>"The powerful enemies have been eliminated, but that doesn't mean the Xin family can rest easy. Grand Elder, Uncle Luo… you must have guessed, the secret realm my father mentioned before his death wasn’t this place.  Elder Qin has agreed to help us enter the secret realm.  You should leave first to recover, and then we’ll set off.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone finally relaxed.  It seemed Elder Qin was a friend, not an enemy.</p><p>For the Xin family, this was the best possible outcome.</p><p>The formation's destruction had impacted the surroundings.  The strange spaces they had traversed on their way in shattered, eliminating the dangers.  They no longer needed Qin Sang's personal escort, so Steward Luo and the others departed first.</p><p>Qin Sang and Young Mistress Xin remained, intending to explore every corner of the area.</p><p>“It seems this place won't last much longer.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the storm of destruction hadn't completely dissipated but was gradually expanding outwards. It was evident that the formation was the foundation of the tomb. With the foundation destroyed, the tomb was collapsing.</p><p>He was powerless to prevent it, so he could only move anything that seemed useful into his pocket dimension before the tomb’s destruction, leaving analysis for later.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang led the Xin family cultivators out of the luminous domain and rejoined those waiting outside.</p><p>They didn't require so many people for what came next. Young Mistress Xin selected a group of core family members, and together they set off with Qin Sang towards the secret realm.</p>
