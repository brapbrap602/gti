<h1>Chapter 2056: Ambush</h1><p>Amidst green hills and clear waters, a cool breeze rustled through the bamboo forest.</p><p>A young woman sat by the lake, dressed in simple white clothes.  Her delicate features held a lingering melancholy as she gazed at her reflection, lost in self-pity.</p><p>A white weasel lay lazily in her lap.</p><p>She gently stroked the weasel, murmuring with a tinge of resentment, "Senior Brother Zhan has been gone for over ten days. Weasel, do you think he'll come see me first when he returns, or Third Senior Sister?"</p><p>The weasel, not asleep, twitched its tail slightly.</p><p>The young woman, unconcerned whether the weasel understood, and without expecting an answer from an unintelligent creature, continued, "If Senior Brother Zhan doesn't see me first, I won't speak to him for ten days… no! A month! And I won't accept his gifts!"</p><p>She wrinkled her nose, humming, determined in her silent vow.</p><p>The weasel rolled its eyes, then seemed to sense something, raising its head before darting off.</p><p>The young woman, startled, saw a white blur rush into the bamboo forest, disappearing in an instant.</p><p>"Weasel!"</p><p>"Weasel, where are you? Come back…"</p><p>She panicked, summoning a white ribbon to pursue, flying above the bamboo forest, searching in vain.  The weasel was gone. She could only call out repeatedly.</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, in a mountain valley far from her sect, the weasel reappeared.</p><p>Alone, it stood on its hind legs, then began to grow and transform into a human form – the young lord of the Siyou clan.</p><p>Slightly unsteady, he stood, glancing towards the battlefield. Tears welled in his eyes.</p><p>He knew, from this moment on, he was alone.</p><p>Wiping away his tears, his expression hardened. He knew he must leave this dangerous place immediately, not letting Xia Changshi's sacrifice be in vain.  They had already planned for the worst.  The Siyou lord looked around, quickly choosing a direction, ready to flee, when a sudden premonition struck him.</p><p>He looked up sharply. The sky changed dramatically, a storm descending without warning, accompanied by two overwhelming auras that enveloped the area, with him at its center.</p><p>He recognized the two auras instantly.  Twice before, they had clashed – they were Jiliang's two accomplices.</p><p>But these two were supposed to be elsewhere, with Jiliang, besieging them. How could they appear here so suddenly?</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>A terrifying possibility struck him: the figures they’d seen before were merely illusions, created to mislead them. The auras could have been mimicked.</p><p>He and Xia Changshi, at a severe disadvantage and desperate to escape, hadn’t considered this.  They hadn't had the chance to verify their identities.</p><p>More importantly, they hadn’t anticipated their plans being discovered.</p><p>During the previous fight with Jiliang and his associates, their actions suggested they lacked knowledge of Siyou clan’s secret arts. How had they been discovered?</p><p>Unless… a powerful enemy with intimate knowledge of the Siyou clan had emerged recently!</p><p>Countless thoughts flooded his mind, leaving him cold with despair.  Regardless of the unknown enemy, the two opponents before him were more than a match for his injured state.</p><p>…</p><p>High above.</p><p>A magic banner unfurled, creating a sealed internal space.  The banner's operator could still sense external changes.</p><p>The space within the banner was small, cramped for two people.  If the Siyou lord and Xia Changshi were here, they would recognize these two as the individuals who had just attacked them; their true forms had been hidden within the banner all along.</p><p>The banner hung suspended, firmly locking onto the island below, sensing any unusual energy fluctuations.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman looked towards the distant sea, her gaze profound.</p><p>"Queli, what is it?"</p><p>Jiqiong, sensing something, asked.</p><p>He wasn't the banner’s master, his spiritual perception was limited, unable to sense distant events.</p><p>However, he knew Jiliang had begun his attack. The Siyou clan’s transformation technique had a distance limitation and was far away, obscured by a large formation. Yet, Queli had sensed something; had a change occurred?</p><p>Unless the intensity of the battle had exceeded the formation's ability to conceal it!</p><p>Queli's lips parted to speak, then her eyes sharpened, focusing on an island.</p><p>Simultaneously, Jiqiong sensed it too.</p><p>The Siyou lord’s transformation was instantly detected.</p><p>"Only one?" Jiqiong questioned incredulously.</p><p>Earlier, it was likely Xia Changshi who fought desperately. That’s good; as long as we capture the younger one, whether the older one lives or dies is immaterial,” Que Li said excitedly, immediately charging out of the Baojing space.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Baojing unfolded, its multicolored radiance stirring the primal energy of heaven and earth, instantly creating a storm that enveloped the area.</p><p>The sky was dark and oppressive.  The two figures, their escaping light as swift as meteors, hurtled towards where the young lord of the Siyou clan had appeared.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain valley.</p><p>The young lord of the Siyou clan realized something was wrong, but it was too late. He could feel the powerful auras of two formidable enemies locked onto him, and his last companion beast had dispersed.</p><p>Knowing escape was impossible, and that even a desperate fight offered no hope, a look of determination flashed in the young lord’s eyes. He would absolutely not allow himself to be captured alive!</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t value his life, but he knew that capture by the Water Department would mean endless humiliation and a fate worse than death.</p><p>Just then, a look of surprise crossed the young lord’s face.</p><p>A strange figure appeared out of nowhere in the high sky, intercepting the two powerful enemies.</p><p>The next moment, the young lord felt a chill, followed by a wisp of black energy drifting before him, swirling into the form of an unfamiliar girl.</p><p>The girl was exquisitely beautiful, smiling at him. But for some reason, when he met her gaze, the young lord felt an inexplicable tightening in his chest, a sense of profound danger.</p><p>He instinctively took a step back. “Who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Su Nu,” Su Nu said, appraising him, smiling slightly. “We’re here to save you.”</p><p>“Save me?”</p><p>The young lord was stunned, then glanced upwards.</p><p>He had thought he faced certain death, but a turn of events had occurred.  Unfortunately, his saviors were two strangers of uncertain intentions, and they appeared to be human cultivators.</p><p>Reason told him to use this opportunity to escape before considering their motives, but he couldn't help but ask, "Why?"</p><p>Su Nu thought for a moment, then spoke frankly, “Because you are valuable.”</p><p>The young lord hesitated.  “How do I know you’re not using me to achieve some goal?”</p><p>“Of course, we’re going to use you. Otherwise, why would we risk saving you?”</p><p>Su Nu looked at him oddly, glancing skyward. “Come with us. It’s better than becoming their prisoners. For now, there's no animosity between us. Take a chance.”</p><p>The young lord fell silent, then finally nodded heavily. “All right. I’ll go with you.”</p><p>Su Nu smiled charmingly.  Seeing the young lord’s weakened state, she asked, “Can you walk?”</p><p>The young lord gave a wry smile. “I should be able to manage for a while.”</p><p>He was still recovering from his wounds, had been forced to use a powerful escape technique, further weakening him.  To avoid detection, he had waited until Xia Changshi detonated the crystal before escaping, suffering further damage in the blast.  Now, even using escape techniques was problematic.</p><p>Su Nu shook her head, lightly flicking her sleeve, wrapping the young lord up, and silently escaping the valley.</p><p>Before acting, Qin Sang had discussed the plan with her.</p><p>Qin Sang could handle the two above alone. If there were other strong enemies, Su Nu and the young lord would only hinder Qin Sang, who would be better able to act freely without them.</p><p>At that moment, the young lord remembered something and cried out, “There are other enemies, about the equivalent of Nascent Soul mid-stage human cultivators. Even Xia Changshi's self-destruction might not kill him.  There’s also likely a hidden enemy who knows our Siyou royal family’s secret techniques very well; they are certainly no ordinary person.  Please warn that friend to be careful…”</p><p>Su Nu’s expression tightened, and she immediately transmitted the message to Qin Sang before flying away without looking back.</p><p>…</p><p>High above.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, unmoved in the storm, calmly watching the two meteors.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The escaping light dimmed, and Ji Qiong and Que Li materialized in the distance, looking surprised and suspicious.  “Who are you, and why are you blocking our path?”</p><p>“You caused havoc in my academy and even dared to use an array to conceal your aura.  You're far too brazen!”</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s ‘self-introduction,’ the two stiffened, realizing the situation was dire.</p><p>They thought their actions were flawless, but they had been exposed, and had no idea where they had gone wrong.</p><p>“Friend, there's a misunderstanding…”</p><p>Ji Qiong tried to resolve the situation with words.</p><p>Que Li, however, sensed something unusual in the mountain valley and angrily transmitted a message, “That person isn't from the Haitang Academy, Ji Xiong! Act quickly, don't let them kidnap the young lord of the Siyou clan!”</p><p>Ji Qiong instantly understood the stakes.  Whether or not the other party was a Haitang Academy cultivator, he couldn't admit it now.</p><p>Their mission was to capture the young lord; their superior would handle the rest.</p><p>Many suspicious circumstances surrounded the matter.  Since the Haitang Academy had already been aware of the situation, why did they only send one... no, two, cultivators at the initial stage of the Transcendent Void Realm?</p><p>"Who dares to impersonate a Haitang Academy scholar? Get lost!"</p><p>Ji Qiong roared, shaking his sleeve.  A jade talisman shattered within, and he and Que Li charged towards the mountain pass.</p><p>This jade talisman was a warning talisman given to them by Elder Quan.</p><p>To capture the young master of the Siyou Clan alive, Elder Quan had condescended to come here and stationed himself between the two locations. This way, regardless of which side encountered problems, Elder Quan could arrive promptly for reinforcements.</p><p>…</p><p>On a small islet, a figure in black robes sat.</p><p>Like the person in white robes, the black robes concealed the person's face.  But the figure's back was hunched, his aura heavy with age, revealing him to be an elderly man – Elder Quan.</p><p>The moment the talisman shattered, Elder Quan abruptly raised his head.  An aged face emerged from beneath the black robes, and an immensely powerful aura erupted, dispersing the clouds in the sky and causing the surrounding sea to sink a hundred meters.</p><p>Then he transformed into a raging wind and swept away.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Ji Qiong and Que Li's decisiveness, Qin Sang sighed inwardly, realizing a peaceful resolution was impossible.</p><p>However, he had anticipated this.  The Grey Warbler Sword instantly transformed into a sword beam and struck.</p><p>Hearing the sword's hum, Ji Qiong and Que Li felt the sword intent bearing down on them.  Their hearts trembled, and they instinctively altered their escape routes, separating to prevent Qin Sang from intercepting them both.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, creating a Dharma body.  With a flash of his sword, as if teleporting, he appeared before Ji Qiong. Simultaneously, the Dharma-image energy exploded within him.  Summoning his Qingluan Dharma-image and wielding the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, his aura surged, transforming into a green light as he charged towards Que Li.</p><p>Ji Qiong could barely register the movement; the sword shadow was already close at hand. He hurriedly summoned his protective treasure, but the sword didn't strike directly but pulled him into a dark, confined space.</p><p>This space was illuminated by starlight, with sword energy everywhere.</p><p>"Sword Formation!"</p><p>Ji Qiong immediately understood his predicament but remained calm.</p><p>Of all sword techniques, sword formations were the easiest for him to deal with compared to the aggressive killing swords or extreme swords.</p><p>Sword stars moved in unison, starlight raining down. Ji Qiong realized he couldn't escape easily and could only hope Que Li succeeded.  He activated his protective treasure, adopting a purely defensive stance, his ears twitching slightly, seemingly listening to something from the void.</p><p>The Quanfeng clan’s renowned ear-hearing ability had various uses; they could potentially "listen" to the escape routes of any large formation.</p><p>Outside the sword formation…</p><p>Qin Sang's main body and Que Li clashed fiercely.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's fierce aura, Que Li was alarmed, abandoning her attempt to stop the woman, and retreated, taking out a silver longbow.</p><p>Without an arrow, Que Li aimed at Qin Sang, her fingers drawing the bowstring, creating a spirit arrow from thin air.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The arrow shot towards Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Then Que Li witnessed something astonishing.  Qin Sang didn't dodge the arrow; instead, with a low growl, he reached out both hands.</p><p>'Crack! Crack!'</p><p>One hand seized the arrow shaft, the other gripped the arrowhead.  His muscles tensed, making popping sounds as he twisted forcefully.</p><p>Just three inches from Qin Sang's forehead, the arrow shattered into nothingness.  Qin Sang didn't even blink, his gaze fixed on Que Li, ferociously charging forward.</p><p>Que Li's eyelids twitched.  She wouldn't dare let Qin Sang get close, gracefully retreating, continuously drawing and shooting arrows.</p><p>Beams of silver light continuously bombarded Qin Sang, exploding before him.  But Qin Sang's advance was unwavering, forcing Que Li to retreat constantly, preventing her from attending to the woman and the Siyou Clan's young master.</p><p>With both Dharma body and Dharma-image, he single-handedly fought two powerful enemies, preventing them from crossing the threshold, leaving the woman and the young master unimpeded.</p><p>In the heat of battle, Qin Sang suddenly felt a warning, his expression changing.  His Dharma body and main body both looked towards the sky.</p><p>From there, an incredibly powerful aura was rapidly approaching!</p><p>()</p>
