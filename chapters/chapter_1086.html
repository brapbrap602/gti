<h1>Chapter 1778: Fusion</h1><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The poison-warding treasures on him shattered one after another.</p><p>The underground river was like a bottomless pit.</p><p>Not only were the undercurrents surging, but the earth itself seemed to be violently shaking.  A great change was about to occur!</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to worry about anything else. He and Bai, working together, were still unable to escape. In this situation, he could only place his hopes on the Fat Silkworm and the Poison-Repelling Shell.</p><p>Bai returned to the Corpse Puppet Sack, lessening the burden on the Fat Silkworm. Qin Sang held the Fat Silkworm close to his chest, allowing himself to be tossed around underground by the suction force.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was giving it its all, straining every fiber of its being.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled the unrefined medicinal power of the Three Lights Jade Liquid to the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>But the Poison-Repelling Shell was still teetering on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The deeper they went into the underground river, the more intense the poison became. It wasn't just a matter of rapid consumption; the Fat Silkworm's innate divine ability had reached its limit and could no longer withstand the erosion of the intense poison.</p><p>After all, the Fat Silkworm was only at the middle stage of its third transformation. The power of its divine ability was limited.</p><p>It wasn't Qin Sang's spirit insect, so the various Witch Clan secret techniques that Qin Sang knew couldn't be applied to it. He couldn't provide assistance like he could with the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Overexerted, the Fat Silkworm whimpered, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Just then, Bai's anxious voice suddenly came from the Corpse Puppet Sack, "Quick! Let your little lover out!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He opened the Corpse Puppet Sack and embraced Yagu.</p><p>Yagu's eyes remained tightly closed, still a sleeping beauty, but her spirit faintly conveyed a sense of anxiety, as if she wanted to tell Qin Sang something but couldn't speak.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid brought vitality, preserving her body from decay.</p><p>Before, warm jade nourished her spirit.</p><p>After receiving a piece of Soul Nourishing Wood from Bai, Qin Sang placed a Soul Nourishing Wood plaque on Yagu. Its effect was far stronger than the warm jade.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang could feel Yagu's condition improving.</p><p>Although she still hadn't awakened, the Fat Silkworm's intelligence had increased. Each action it displayed was more affectionate and trusting towards Qin Sang than before, even carrying a sense of childlike adoration.</p><p>There's a mysterious connection between a master and their natal spirit insect.</p><p>For Yagu, the Fat Silkworm was her anchor in the real world.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Fat Silkworm was likely influenced by Yagu. Thanks to the Soul Nourishing Wood, Yagu's consciousness hadn't faded but had become increasingly stable.</p><p>As Yagu appeared, the Fat Silkworm whimpered, its body bouncing once before leaping onto Yagu's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop it.</p><p>Seven-colored light flickered, and the Fat Silkworm unexpectedly merged into Yagu's body.</p><p>Without any visible action from Yagu, in the next moment, a burst of seven-colored light suddenly erupted from within her, merging into the Poison-Repelling Shell.</p><p>The previously teetering Poison-Repelling Shell regained its stability, blocking the intense poison!</p><p>The Fat Silkworm willingly acknowledged Yagu as its master.</p><p>It was said that in the Witch Clan's Insect Gu techniques, this was the best form of acknowledgment, surpassing even a natal spirit insect. Not only were the cultivator and spirit insect's minds incredibly attuned, but there were also unexpected benefits.</p><p>Such an opportunity was rare and unpredictable.</p><p>The Witch Clan, like the Human Clan, had lost too many secrets. Current Witch Clan cultivators no longer understood how to make a spirit insect willingly acknowledge a master, nor did they know what the benefits would be.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt both joy and worry.</p><p>The joy came from Yagu and the Fat Silkworm's fusion, which was likely an ability brought about by the Fat Silkworm's willing acknowledgment.  They no longer had to worry about dying in the poisonous pool, for now.</p><p>The worry stemmed from Yagu's weak cultivation. She was only at the Qi Refining stage when she was gravely injured and near death because of him. What impact would this have on her?</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>The halo continued to flicker.</p><p>Immediately following, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. His premonition was coming true. Yagu's face became deathly pale, her aura rapidly weakening. Her spirit was even more fragile than before, like a flickering candle in the wind.</p><p>But she persisted, tirelessly expending everything she had. Both she and the Fat Silkworm were fighting for their lives!</p><p>"Vitality…"</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely anxious, continuously channeling the remaining medicinal power to Yagu, but with little effect. He knew too little about the Witch Clan, and didn't even understand what Yagu and the Fat Silkworm were expending. It might be something more fundamental than vitality.</p><p>"Spirit Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>Bai reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had thought of it too. The Spirit Cleansing Liquid wasn't only an aid for Nascent Soul formation, but it could also provide a cultivator with abundant spiritual power.  It might be effective.</p><p>Losing his life meant losing everything. Now wasn't the time to be stingy.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a bottle of Spirit Cleansing Liquid and fed it to Yagu.</p><p>The Spirit Cleansing Liquid, combined with the vitality of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, slowed down Yagu's depletion, but it still couldn't stop the situation from continuing to worsen.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Repeatedly colliding with the sharp edges of rocks, Qin Sang felt intense pain throughout his body.</p><p>He didn't know how far the undercurrent had carried them.</p><p>It felt like he had fallen into a giant whirlpool, experiencing a wave of dizziness.</p><p>He firmly protected Yagu, suddenly feeling his body lighten. He had unexpectedly broken free from the poisonous water. Then, before he could react, he crashed heavily onto the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>The Flood Dragon King and the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise discovered the True Dragon's ancient restriction.</p><p>A stone gate was sealed by the restriction.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King studied it for a long time before discerning some clues and began attempting to break the restriction.</p><p>Using his Flood Dragon blood as a guide, he inscribed the Flood Dragon Clan's inherited restrictions onto the stone gate, resonating with the True Dragon's ancient restriction, although this resonance was very weak, insufficient to open the stone gate.</p><p>The poison here was too potent. The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise couldn't endure it on its own, so they had to take turns resisting the poison. The Flood Dragon King taught the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise the Flood Dragon Clan's inherited secret techniques.</p><p>The two demons exchanged ideas, changing their strategies multiple times, analyzing the ancient restriction.</p><p>Finally, the resonance with the Azure Dragon's ancient restriction grew stronger.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The stone gate vibrated, a crack reluctantly opening.</p><p>The two demons were overjoyed and quickly slipped inside.</p><p>Behind the stone gate was an ancient hall.</p><p>The hall was dark, but it didn't hinder the two great demons' vision. Their gazes swept across the hall, finding it empty except for a crystal pillar standing in the center.</p><p>"It really is a dragon corpse!"</p><p>The two demon kings stared blankly at the crystal.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise gasped, its eyes filled with greed.</p><p>Inside the crystal pillar was a skeleton, slender in form, its entire body encased within the crystal. It was neither python nor Flood Dragon, but the skeleton of a True Dragon!</p><p>Its flesh had decayed, leaving only bones, yet the dragon corpse still exuded an imposing aura, its head held high, its presence awe-inspiring!</p><p>It was unknown how long ago the True Dragon had fallen.</p><p>Standing there, facing the skeleton, they could still feel the True Dragon's pressure, compelling them to prostrate themselves in worship.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise wanted to approach, but the Flood Dragon King stopped it.</p><p>"Beware of the ancient restriction's backlash!"</p><p>The Flood Dragon King suppressed his excitement and carefully observed, discovering layers of restrictions on the crystal. The dragon corpse wasn't complete; it was damaged in many places, its claws missing, and even its skull had cracks.</p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, this should be a seal. In ancient times, the Demon Clan likely used this dragon corpse as the vessel for the seal..."</p><p>They examined it carefully, but couldn't determine what it was used to seal.</p><p>With the passage of time, the True Dragon's ancient restriction had weakened to this point, the crystal pillar's luster had dimmed, and the dragon corpse had decayed.  Whatever lay beneath the seal was most likely dead.</p><p>Even if something were released, they could retrieve the dragon corpse and flee immediately, leaving the cultivators to face the consequences.</p>
