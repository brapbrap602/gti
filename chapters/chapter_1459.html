<h1>Chapter 1451: Glacial Soul Light</h1><p>Chapter 1451: Glacial Soul Light</p><p>Generally speaking, early Nascent Soul cultivators no longer pose much of a threat to him.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't underestimate any opponent, especially those from prominent sects.</p><p>They might lack experience and hardship, and their actions might not be as ruthless and decisive as independent cultivators, but they have a much greater chance of inheriting powerful treasures from their masters.</p><p>His spiritual sense detected something strange, but there was nothing unusual in the surrounding area.</p><p>At that moment, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly also sent a warning, but her mental message was somewhat hesitantly human-like, as if uncertain about what she had seen.</p><p>It was very similar to Qin Sang's feeling.</p><p>Encountering this situation for the first time, Qin Sang chose to trust his intuition and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, without the slightest hesitation, he shifted his escape light, abruptly moving several meters away.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang saw a layer of cold mist rapidly spreading across one side of the golden-yellow protective dome, then freezing into thin ice right before his eyes.</p><p>Unlike the Winter Talisman used by Shi Xue before, or the ice shield condensed by Elder Mei,</p><p>This ice was without impurities or discoloration, completely transparent.  One would easily mistake it for non-existent if not carefully observed. Yet, even through the protective dome, Qin Sang could feel the extreme cold that could freeze a Nascent Soul.</p><p>Where he had originally stood,</p><p>a white mist silently rose.</p><p>Inside the mist were countless tiny ice crystals, which then formed hair-like ice threads, transforming into mysterious runes that flashed and disappeared.</p><p>At that moment, the extreme cold erupted, and the void seemed to be frozen, giving the sensation of stillness.</p><p>Only now did a faint white vapor appear, its source being the rapidly approaching figure in white.</p><p>‘Hiss…’</p><p>Qin Sang gasped, thankful for his caution and for never underestimating any opponent.</p><p>The newcomer's cultivation was similar to the woman in green, yet she almost put Qin Sang in mortal danger—something Elders Mei and Lan had failed to do.</p><p>If he hadn't moved away from that area in time, he would have been frozen solid on the spot.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang could withstand the cold's erosion and break free, the two in the sword formation would have seized the opportunity to escape and surround him.</p><p>At that point, the situation would have reversed, and Qin Sang's plan would have failed!</p><p>…</p><p>The newcomer was Liuli. Seeing her senior sister in danger, she quickly acted to save her.</p><p>As she chanted the incantation, Liuli's eyes were engulfed in a幽蓝, as deep as the sea, and her whole demeanor changed, becoming solitary and cold.</p><p>Glacial Soul Light!</p><p>Formless, intangible, and immaterial, a top-tier divine ability of the Ice Dao!</p><p>The so-called ice, ice crystals, and white mist were actually phenomena caused by the external environment being affected by the Glacial Soul Light's instantaneous eruption.</p><p>By the time the enemy noticed the phenomenon, they had already been hit!</p><p>If Liuli's Glacial Soul Light reached its peak, it would be even harder to detect before its eruption.</p><p>Seeing that her Glacial Soul Light had missed, Liuli paused slightly, but her movements didn't stop. A phoenix-shaped sword appeared in her palm, and she thrust it forward, her figure flashing along the trail of white vapor.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the nearby mist, suppressing his curiosity about this divine ability.</p><p>In this brief delay, the Seven Souls Killing Formation had fully erupted. Though battered, Mei and Lan within the sword formation had indeed survived.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. While they were still entangled by the formation's aftershocks, he recalled his Golden Sink Sword, striking at the incoming sword light, while reaching for the corpse puppet bag at his waist, preparing to intercept others himself and have the Nascent Soul puppet capture the woman in green.</p><p>At this moment, he caught sight of the phoenix-shaped sword within the sword light.</p><p>This glimpse caused his expression to freeze.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind involuntarily conjured an image, awakening a long-forgotten memory.</p><p>The figure was both strange and familiar. Though only a few fragmented memories remained, each event was deeply etched in his mind.</p><p>When he had first entered the Purple Micro Palace, it was Chen Yan, wielding this very sword, who had blocked Dongyang Bo, allowing Qin Sang to escape his control and flee to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned to the figure in white.</p><p>The veil could not block the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's vision; the perfect face perfectly matched the person in his memory.</p><p>“It’s her!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart jolted. The newcomer was actually Chen Yan, and Chen Yan was from Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>This was unexpected to Qin Sang.</p><p>Chen Yan's master had been trapped in the Purple Micro Palace for so long, yet her sect had sent no one to rescue her, abandoning Chen Yan, who was only at the Qi Condensation stage at the time, alone in a foreign land, dependent on others, struggling to find a way to save her master.</p><p>To save her master, she disregarded her reputation, cultivating a yin-yang cultivation technique and falling prey to Dongyang Bo's schemes.</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed Chen Yan's master was a solitary cultivator with no family, never expecting such a powerful connection.  The Xuan Tian Palace Master is a Grand Cultivator, certainly capable of traversing the storm zone. Dongyang Bo wouldn't dare to scheme against someone of that stature.</p><p>Yet, Chen Yan's master has been missing for so long, and no one has searched for her.</p><p>When deciding to come to the North Sea, Qin Sang anticipated possibly encountering Chen Yan; Yuan Ying cultivators are neither rare nor common there. He worried that Chen Yan might have been influenced by Dongyang Bo, practicing the so-called Stone Bridge Zen.  Chen Yan had given him the opportunity to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, and her cooperation in helping him escape Dongyang Bo's grasp allowed him to continue his cultivation. Qin Sang harbored no ill will towards her, hoping for a peaceful parting.</p><p>Never did he expect this kind of reunion.</p><p>“She's a Spirit Root cultivator, has been a Yuan Ying for nearly three hundred years, yet remains at the early Yuan Ying stage.  Could it be, as Dongyang Bo said, that she's been affected by the debilitating effects of a ‘Yin-Yang’ cultivation technique?”</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, filling him with complicated emotions.  His thoughts raced, yet his actions remained swift and precise.</p><p>Despite their tangled past and lack of communication, they were essentially strangers.  Chen Yan's presence wouldn't alter his plans.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>His Golden Sinking Sword met the Phoenix-shaped sword, deflecting the blow.  Two blasts of sword energy collided like storms, the Phoenix sword clearly outmatched, flying back.  Liuli, following close behind, her eyes glowing once more with icy blue light, unleashed her Ice Soul Radiance again.  The strain of repeatedly using this powerful technique was clearly visible on her face.</p><p>“Junior Sister, be careful!”</p><p>Seeing her junior sister arrive, Shi Xue, while relieved, was deeply worried, urgently warning her.  This fiend was too terrifying; her junior sister was no match!</p><p>Just then,</p><p>The icy blue in Liuli's eyes flickered violently.  She looked up, directly at the masked figure.  A moment of bewilderment clouded her gaze.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>After more than two hundred years, their gazes locked again, this time on a battlefield.</p><p>“Hmm?  She seems to have recognized me?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Chen Yan's reaction and muttered to himself.  That dangerous feeling returned.  Without hesitation, he attacked.</p><p>His sword transformed into a thousand, cleaving through the extreme cold!</p><p>At that moment, the two elders were about to regroup, aiming their magical artifacts at Qin Sang. But just as one hand reached for the Corpse Puppet bag, it froze.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened with intense vigilance, fully alert to the danger!</p>
