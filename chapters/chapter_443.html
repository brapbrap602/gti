<h1>Chapter 436: Retreat</h1><p>Mu Yifeng was even more shocked than those on the boat.  He clearly remembered that when they last parted, Qin Sang was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. Now, not only was Qin Sang's cultivation comparable to his own, but his strength was terrifying. He killed a peer with a single sword strike! After a brief moment of shock, Mu Yifeng realized this was no time for contemplation. He hastily sent a voice transmission to Qin Sang, quickly explaining the enemy's presence on the boat.  Then, without hesitation, he turned and flew away with all his might. He was no longer able to fight and staying would only hinder Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang remained hidden underwater. Seeing Mu Yifeng's actions, he gave a silent nod of approval and looked towards the distant water.  He learned from Mu Yifeng that there were seven people on the boat. Two were late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, requiring Qin Sang's attention. One was the owner of the boat, the man standing at the bow. The other was injured; Qin Sang had previously seen someone meditating at the stern and guessed it was him.</p><p>Before Qin Sang encountered them, Mu Yifeng had already fought a great battle with the Heavenly Firmament Alliance cultivators.  Of course, Mu Yifeng wasn't alone during the battle, or he wouldn't have lasted this long, but now he was the only one left.  With Mu Yifeng was a senior from Shaohua Mountain named Kuang Yi, of whom Qin Sang had heard. Kuang Yi's cultivation was slightly higher than Mu Yifeng's. Unfortunately, he was entangled in the battle and, seeing no hope of escape, fought to the death, killing several and severely injuring one of the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. This gave Mu Yifeng the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Besides the two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, the remaining five varied in cultivation level, but they cooperated well, advancing and retreating in an orderly fashion. If entangled by them, it would be difficult to break free. Fortunately, the Heavenly Firmament Alliance cultivators had also paid a heavy price, with only these few remaining, and almost all of them were injured and their strength greatly reduced.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on the distant boat, secretly activating his escape technique, slowly retreating. Before leaving, he didn't forget to use his spiritual power to gather the storage pouch from the corpse, taking the spoils of war.</p><p>The boat stopped.</p><p>Water and sky merged into one.</p><p>A lone boat floated quietly on the jewel-like clear lake water, a serene and beautiful scene.  Everyone on the boat, including the two who were meditating, now stood, their expressions grave, staring ahead with deep shock in their eyes.</p><p>The vast water surface stretched as far as the eye could see.  Faintly visible was the spot where the two halves of the corpse had fallen, a patch of lake water stained red. The blood spread and quickly diluted to the point of being invisible.</p><p>A deathly silence filled the air.</p><p>"Senior Brother Luo, that sword strike... as fast as lightning, accompanied by divine thunder... could it be..." A young man in a long robe recalled the shocking scene, his throat bobbing, his voice dry as he subconsciously looked at the man in the blue robe standing at the bow. This was his fellow disciple, surnamed Luo.</p><p>After stopping the boat, Luo had been staring straight ahead. The boat was his magical tool, under his control. Since stopping, he had maintained this posture, standing there motionless, not starting the boat.  Those behind him couldn't see his expression and didn't know what he was thinking.  Hearing the young man in the long robe, the others' expressions shifted, their gazes focusing on him.  A quick-witted one immediately thought of something and exclaimed, "Sword Qi Thunder Sound! Fellow Daoist Sun, are you saying it was Sword Qi Thunder Sound?!"</p><p>Everyone's faces changed dramatically.  Sword Qi Thunder Sound, the ultimate realm pursued by sword cultivators!</p><p>Sun and Luo's sect specialized in swordsmanship. In the past century, only one Nascent Soul cultivator in their sect had successfully grasped Sword Qi Thunder Sound, and he was quite renowned within the Heavenly Firmament Alliance.</p><p>"How could it be Sword Qi Thunder Sound? Could it be a Golden Core cultivator from the Small Cold Realm?" Someone cried out in alarm, their face filled with terror.</p><p>The boat was in an uproar.  If a Golden Core cultivator had arrived, they were doomed. Even if they tried to escape now, it would be futile!</p><p>"Could it be someone using thunder techniques combined with swordsmanship to mimic Sword Qi Thunder Sound?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun, did you really see clearly?"</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, a man in white clothes, who had been protected in the middle, stepped forward. Looking at Luo's back, he asked in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist Luo, I was meditating just now and didn't see clearly... what did you see? Was it truly Sword Qi Thunder Sound?"</p><p>Luo let out a long breath and turned around. His expression was strange, with a hint of relief and a touch of envy. "It was indeed Sword Qi Thunder Sound! I once witnessed my master's uncle demonstrate it, but..." Luo shook his head slightly.  "But it wasn't a Golden Core cultivator. While his swordsmanship is formidable, killing Fellow Daoist Wu with one strike, he's not a Golden Core! The same strike is far less terrifying than my master's uncle's. Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to ambush, hiding his head and showing his tail... This person must be a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"</p><p>Not a Golden Core!  Everyone's expressions relaxed, but then they became even more surprised.</p><p>"A Foundation Establishment cultivator comprehending Sword Qi Thunder Sound, this... even in legends, few have achieved this..."</p><p>Luo nodded, saying with some envy, "In my sect, there has only been one exceptionally talented senior who achieved this, but unfortunately, that senior had mixed spiritual roots and ultimately stopped at the False Core realm!"</p><p>"Even if he's not a Golden Core, everyone must remain vigilant!" Luo warned sternly. "You all saw the power of that sword strike; Fellow Daoist Wu had no power to resist! I needn't elaborate on the terrors of Sword Qi Thunder Sound, otherwise, it wouldn't have so many sword cultivators obsessed with it. Summon your magical tools, support each other, and don't get isolated, giving this person a chance to strike!"</p><p>Everyone understood the danger, gathered together, and followed the orders, summoning their magical tools to guard their surroundings. They raised their alertness to the highest level, their eyes vigilant, staring at the seemingly calm waters around them.  The man in white didn't dare to be careless, summoning a flying sword that hovered in front of him.  He secretly transmitted to Luo, "Fellow Daoist Luo, that person's strength is unfathomable, and he's skilled in stealth and trickery. The enemy is hidden, and we are exposed.  I'm afraid this will be difficult to handle."</p><p>Luo's eyes flickered. "What do you suggest, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"The seniors only instructed us to pursue and prevent them from seeking reinforcements, but they didn't say we had to annihilate them. Now that our squad has suffered such heavy casualties, even Fellow Daoist Wu has perished, which is a first. We can't risk all our lives here, can we? What do you think, Fellow Daoist Luo?"</p><p>Listening to the man in white, Luo knew he was thinking of retreating. A hidden opponent proficient in Sword Qi Thunder Sound and capable of killing a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator was indeed unsettling.</p><p>"You're right, Fellow Daoist. We've already killed several and delayed them for so long.  Returning now will be enough to account for ourselves to the seniors..."  Luo nodded slightly, tapped his foot, and the boat turned, cutting through the waves as it sped away.</p>
