<h1>Chapter 1922: Blood Moon</h1><p>Qin Sang produced a handful of pitch-black pills as if by magic, handing them to Xiao Wu. Three pills per pot of water would suffice.  After boiling, the crowd lined up to receive the water, also served by Xiao Wu and the others. A single bowl was enough to revitalize them.  These people were naturally grateful to Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, showering even the three young girls with profuse thanks.  Experiencing this for the first time, the girls' faces, now mostly free of dust thanks to the rising steam, flushed crimson as they couldn't help but smile.</p><p>“Little Immortal Sister, aren't you happy?”</p><p>The youngest girl, shorter than even Xiao Wu and unable to do heavy work, assisted Xiao Wu, tilting her small face upwards. Seeing Xiao Wu's consistently calm expression, devoid of any smile, she asked with confusion.</p><p>Xiao Wu filled a bowl with the medicinal water for the person in front of her, tilting her head slightly.</p><p>“Thank you, Little Immortal! Thank you, Immortal, for saving my life.  From now on, my entire family will worship you and kowtow to you every day…”  The person bowed repeatedly, his gratitude genuine as he carefully carried the medicinal water away.</p><p>Xiao Wu thought for a moment, then said, “It’s good.”</p><p>The little girl became even more perplexed.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted from Xiao Wu to an empty space beside them: “Has the Earth God arrived? Why not reveal yourself?”</p><p>A plume of white smoke rose from the ground, revealing an elderly man of short stature, holding a staff.</p><p>“The local Earth God greets the Immortal,” the Earth God bowed in respect.</p><p>“This humble Daoist is Qing Feng. I dare not claim the title of Immortal,” Qin Sang shook his head slightly, glancing at the long queue. His tone suddenly shifted, “This humble Daoist had thought this area was devoid of divine spirits.”</p><p>The Earth God's expression turned awkward as he hastily explained, “It is not that this minor god shirks his responsibility to this land, but with chaos engulfing the world, demons roam freely, some even daring to hunt gods for sustenance.  Their audacity knows no bounds. This minor god's power is meager, how dare I reveal myself? I could only destroy my own temple, retreating to the wilderness, hiding amongst the mountains and rivers, barely clinging to life.  Seeing the Daoist’s righteous act, I dared to show myself.”</p><p>“Are they demons from the Twilight Mountains?” Qin Sang looked westward.</p><p>The Earth God nodded, “If it were only the surrounding demons and demonic cultivators, we could still suppress them.  However, a few years ago, they colluded with the demons of the Twilight Mountains, infiltrating our territory, breaching cities and slaying gods.  The City God unfortunately perished in battle, his divine statue shattered. With the divine order in ruins, the righteous Immortal cultivators within the realm are each in peril. Even the foremost sect, the Dragon Guard Mountain, was forced to relocate. No one can restrain them anymore…”</p><p>Sighing, the Earth God continued, “I hear things are even worse closer to the Twilight Mountains. The demons prey on mortals for sustenance.  Some entire nations have been consumed. Those slightly better off are treated as livestock, fattened up and driven to slaughter each other, their flesh and blood used to construct altars for cultivating wicked techniques like Blood Soul.  Even those nations and righteous Immortal cultivators capable of self-preservation can only mind their own business, struggling to survive. I've heard the situation is somewhat better in the east.  Daoist, are you from the east?”</p><p>As they spoke, a commotion erupted at the back of the queue.</p><p>Several burly men pushed their way forward from the end of the line.</p><p>These men, with their bandit-like air and imposing physiques, stood out starkly among the frail commoners.</p><p>The leader, his face covered in rough flesh and eyes glinting with a fierce light, intimidated the others, who lowered their heads, not daring to meet his gaze for fear of being targeted.</p><p>“Boss, the Immortal is right there!”</p><p>A bare-chested companion tugged at the leader, pointing forward and whispering.</p><p>Due to limited space, the queue snaked back and forth. They reached the first bend, hiding behind the crowd, peering through the gaps.</p><p>The leader narrowed his eyes, “A true Immortal?”</p><p>“That's right, Boss.  Look at those who drank the medicine. They’re all full of vigor. It must be a divine elixir! An immortal elixir! A single sip could grant a hundred years of life! Let’s hurry and join the queue, it’ll be gone soon!” The companion licked his lips, his eyes filled with greed.</p><p>“So many people, what's the point of queuing!  How many can the immortal elixir possibly suffice for?”</p><p>The leader scoffed, suddenly looking at the person next to him in line, staring without a word.</p><p>He didn't need to speak; his gaze was like that of a ravenous wolf.</p><p>The person he stared at trembled in fear, shrinking back.</p><p>The burly men stared at each person in turn, forcibly creating a small space in the queue.</p><p>The queue was already crowded, and with this forceful shoving, an elderly man lost his footing and fell to the ground.</p><p>His heart pounding with anxiety, the old man pointed at them with trembling hands, “You! You dare act so brazenly before the Immortal…”</p><p>“Oh dear! Be careful, old man.”</p><p>The leader strode forward, pressing down on the old man's arm and helping him up without a word, his face full of concern.</p><p>Yet his eyes were like daggers, as if saying, old man, I’ve remembered you!</p><p>Even through the crowd, such actions couldn’t escape the eyes of Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>“Hey! Old Earth God!”</p><p>Zhu Que hopped from Qin Sang's shoulder onto the Earth God, startling him.  Only then did he realize this fire crow was also cultivated, and he quickly forced a smile.</p><p>“What instructions does this demon Immortal have?”</p><p>Zhu Que craned its neck and stared at him, “You are the Earth God of this place.  Even if you didn’t dare show yourself, you must know what these people have done, right?”</p><p>“As long as it’s within the vicinity of Mount Wudu, I know! I know everything!”</p><p>“Tell me, among these people, which ones have committed rape, pillage, or even cannibalism?”</p><p>As the saying goes, Heaven watches what people do.  Three feet above your head, there are deities.</p><p>Every action of these people was seen and recorded by the Earth God.  Raising his staff, he pointed them out one by one, recounting their deeds as if they were treasures.</p><p>After listening, Zhu Que opened its beak and spat out a ball of fire, which dispersed into sparks, shooting outwards.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The burly men, who were laughing and chatting, suddenly fell backwards, each with an almost imperceptible small hole in their foreheads.</p><p>Similar incidents occurred elsewhere, causing bursts of commotion.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhu Que.</p><p>“You only said that you and Xiao Wu wouldn't kill, but I didn’t!  Isn't it a waste to give the pills to these kinds of people?” Zhu Que hummed a tune it had learned from the mortal world, avoiding Qin Sang’s gaze and hopping onto Xiao Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang said, “These people are heading to the Duzhi Kingdom ahead. I observe that the Duzhi Kingdom is not in chaos and its laws are strict.  They shouldn't tolerate such villains.”</p><p>The Earth God bowed, “The Daoist is correct. This minor god had also intended to report the actions of these people to fellow deities in the Duzhi Kingdom. However, this Demon Immortal’s actions are truly gratifying.  All of you are benevolent and righteous, a blessing to the people, a fortune to us deities, and a blessing to the world!”</p><p>“You needn't flatter me. This humble Daoist is not a sage who saves the world.  I can only offer them a full stomach, enough to sustain them for a few days until they reach the Duzhi Kingdom, where they can fend for themselves.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, “I can save them for a moment, but not forever. I can protect one place, but not the entire world!”</p><p>He had said that he would seek an opportunity to suppress Xiao Wu’s demonic nature through healing and saving people.</p><p>But he was very clear about his own goal.</p><p>He understood even more clearly that this was the way of the world, and his own power alone couldn't change it.</p><p>He harbored no unrealistic notions, letting everything unfold naturally.</p><p>A flicker of disappointment crossed the Earth God’s face.  He had once witnessed the Sect Master of Dragon Guard Mountain, whose demeanor was far inferior to the Daoist before him.  He had hoped for a virtuous expert to descend from the mountains and change the world for the better.</p><p>Pot after pot of medicinal water was distributed.</p><p>The sun set, and the scorching heat subsided somewhat.</p><p>The last rays of the evening glow were obscured by the mountain shadows as dusk settled.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, who was speaking with the Earth God, suddenly felt something amiss and abruptly looked up!</p><p>In the darkening sky, a sliver of the moon appeared.</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky, incredibly distant and unreachable, its light faint, even dimmer than the surrounding stars.</p><p>Gradually, the moon underwent a bizarre transformation. A faint red glow emerged around the edge of the lunar halo.</p><p>The red glow seemed to emanate from behind the moon, becoming strikingly prominent within moments. It wasn't a pure red, but a blood-red crimson, forming a blood-colored ring around the lunar halo.</p><p>The red glow continued to expand, larger than the halo, brighter than the moonlight, even staining the moon itself with a crimson hue!</p><p>This spectacle was as if another blood moon had risen behind the moon, yet its true form remained hidden from view on the ground, obscured by the moon itself.</p><p>Two moons shone together!</p><p>No, three moons shone together!</p><p>Qin Sang’s pupils constricted slightly as he noticed that with the appearance of the red glow, a slightly dimmer patch of moonlight appeared beneath the moon.  It was less than a tenth the size of the moon, but clearly larger than a star, resembling a small, dark moon.</p><p>The dark moon slowly revolved around the true moon, sometimes hidden within the blood-red glow behind the moon, sometimes appearing in front, merging with the moonlight, making it difficult for ordinary people to perceive.</p><p>The blood moon, the moon, and the dark moon, three moons shining together!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s reaction, the Earth God also looked towards the sky.  Witnessing the celestial phenomenon, his face registered shock.</p><p>The moonlight, stained blood-red, bathed the earth, and even mortals noticed the anomaly.</p><p>“Heavens! Look at the sky!”</p><p>“The moon has turned red!”</p><p>“The Blood Moon! It’s the legendary Blood Moon!”</p><p>…</p><p>The crimson moonlight fell upon the earth, casting a faint blood-red hue over the land and mountains.</p><p>The people felt as if they were immersed in a sea of blood. Those who had witnessed the horrors of war were reminded of painful memories, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>“This is an omen of war and slaughter!”</p><p>“An ill omen…an ill omen…Even the moon is stained with blood. Everyone will die, everyone will die…”</p><p>They had just been rescued by the Immortal, escaping their suffering, only to witness the appearance of the Blood Moon, the world bathed in crimson!</p><p>Fear spread, plunging them into deep panic.</p><p>Even the Earth God muttered, “The Blood Moon has appeared. Is the world truly destined for utter chaos?”</p><p>Fire Domain Dao Abode.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body also emerged from his cave dwelling, gazing at the Blood Moon in the sky, just like his avatar.</p><p>He had been in the Great Thousand World for over three hundred years, yet this was the first time he had witnessed a Blood Moon.  He had never heard of such a phenomenon before.</p><p>Why was this happening? Was it a natural celestial event, or was there some other mystery at play?</p><p>“Has a Blood Moon ever appeared before?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked the Earth God.</p><p>The Earth God hesitated, “This minor god has seen the writings of a Mountain God, which recorded the Blood Moon. He had gathered information from ancient texts and learned that the Blood Moon appears irregularly, sometimes every few hundred years, sometimes every few thousand. Sometimes it lasts for an hour, sometimes until dawn, with no discernible pattern.  The reason is unknown, and it is speculated to be an ill omen…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The Earth God’s words about world chaos were pure nonsense. He could be certain that the Blood Moon didn't shine solely on this place.  He didn't know how many thousands of miles away…</p><p>At this very moment, the entire Great Thousand World was likely bathed in the Blood Moon's light. Even if it were an ill omen, it couldn’t possibly pertain solely to this place.</p><p>Even the entire territory under Yun Du Tianzhi’s rule was probably not even a corner of the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Since it recurred every few hundred or thousand years, it was a pattern of sorts. Perhaps it was a unique celestial phenomenon of the Great Thousand World, or perhaps someone was displaying great divine power.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but recall the Southern Heaven Gate hidden within the moon.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid! The Immortal is here, the Immortal will save us!”</p><p>“Immortal, save us!”</p><p>After the initial panic, someone cried out.</p><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze and knelt down again, kowtowing and praying for protection.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to gaze at the Blood Moon in the sky.  He noticed that after the Blood Moon and the dark moon appeared, they didn’t change further, maintaining their current state.</p><p>Unable to discern anything, he shifted his attention and continued to ask the Earth God, “Do you know of any sects or factions in the vicinity renowned for their lightning techniques?”</p><p>According to Qin Sang's deduction, the Dharma Altar was nearby, but the area was quite vast, possibly encompassing several neighboring kingdoms.</p><p>The Earth God pondered for a moment, then shook his head, “This minor god enjoys making friends and had a wide circle of acquaintances before the chaos erupted. I have some understanding of those renowned sects. They might cultivate one or two lightning techniques, but none truly rely on lightning techniques, establishing their sect based on it.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, thought for a moment, and continued to ask, “Are there any reclusive experts?”</p><p>“There are certainly recluses, but for the Daoist, they might not be considered experts.” The Earth God subtly flattered him, sharing all he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang noted everything down.  Searching for the Dharma Altar, starting with sects and cultivators was naturally the fastest way.  If that failed, he would have to search inch by inch.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about the demons in the vicinity, extending his spiritual sense beyond Mount Wudu.</p><p>In the distance, cultivators within the mountains, demons wreaking havoc in the mortal world – no evil entity could escape his detection.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Within the mountains, the wind and clouds shifted dramatically.</p><p>Without warning, a violent gale swept through the mountains, kicking up a whirlwind of dust and stones.</p><p>The cultivators in the mountains felt a sudden chill and unease.</p><p>The sudden demonic wind, coupled with the Blood Moon in the sky, made this night too eerie.</p><p>They shuddered, wanting to return to their caves and lairs.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and grasped forward.</p><p>All the demons targeted by Qin Sang suddenly felt a powerful force restrain them, immobilizing them.  Then, an immense force lifted them into the air.</p><p>Even the demons within their caves and lairs couldn't escape, their formations and restrictions rendered useless.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The gale swept up figures, struggling mightily but to no avail.</p><p>Beside the earthen path.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud! Thud!’</p><p>The Earth God stared blankly at the horizon, watching as demons flew out of the mountains, crashing heavily in front of him.</p><p>The majority of these demons possessed higher cultivation than him and were beings he wouldn't dare provoke.  Yet now, they were like chickens, falling pathetically and helplessly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a large pile formed on the ground, consisting of demons and evil cultivators, each one utterly terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored their pleas for mercy, flicking a speck of spiritual light into their foreheads, effortlessly controlling their souls.</p><p>Finally, he extracted a wisp of soul light and sealed it within a jade pendant, handing it to the Earth God.</p><p>“This humble Daoist observes that you are dissatisfied with the current state of affairs, and you must harbor ambitions.  With this jade pendant, you can control their lives and deaths.  Whether you punish them for their crimes or command them to assist you in slaying demons and eliminating evil, it is up to you.”</p><p>“Th-th-this…”</p><p>The Earth God held the jade pendant, his lips trembling.  A dignified Earth God, he was so moved that he couldn't speak.</p>
