<h1>Chapter 500: A Dreamlike State</h1><p>Chapter 500: A Dreamlike State</p><p>A day in the cave, a millennium in the world.</p><p>Qin Sang, merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, is still far from the realm of immortals.</p><p>However, for cultivators, time passes extremely quickly during meditation.</p><p>Unknowingly, another month has passed.</p><p>The last trace of the failed attempt to consume the Kanli Golden Pill has long been erased from his mind.  His Dao heart is now serene, and Qin Sang has once again brought his condition to its peak.</p><p>Snow Spirit Lotus.</p><p>Iris Flower.</p><p>One white, one red; one yin, one yang. Two herbs are placed side-by-side before Qin Sang.</p><p>The two herbs emanate a gentle aura. Even when their energies intertwine, they don't clash violently like the Kanli Golden Pill's potent force.</p><p>Right now, the other Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Xiaohan region must be envying Qin Sang's luck.</p><p>Unlike the Kanli Golden Pill, these herbs cannot be artificially cultivated and refined.</p><p>These two herbs are interdependent and cannot survive alone. The Snow Spirit Lotus thrives in icy cold environments, while the Iris Flower requires intense heat.  Therefore, they must grow where cold and heat converge, and the balance between them must be perfect—an incredibly stringent requirement.</p><p>Such herbs are extremely rare.</p><p>But ultimately, supplementary aids are just that—aids.</p><p>Recalling the instructions on consumption given by the Snake Granny when he selected these herbs, Qin Sang takes out a few restorative and healing pills, placing them in his mouth. Then, holding one herb in each hand, he raises them before him.</p><p>Spiritual energy flows into Qin Sang's palms, transforming them into furnaces to refine the herbs.</p><p>Starting from the roots, the two herbs are almost simultaneously refined.</p><p>One transforms into an icy-clear liquid, crystal-like and translucent.</p><p>The other is refined into a red liquid, appearing as if a layer of flame burns on its surface.</p><p>Qin Sang is extremely cautious. It takes him a considerable amount of time to carefully refine away all impurities, leaving behind only the purest medicinal essence.</p><p>The two liquid masses are of equal size.</p><p>Then, he swallows the restorative pills.</p><p>Moments later, his depleted spiritual energy is restored to its peak. Qin Sang's eyes sharpen; he gently exhales and swallows both liquid masses together.</p><p>Amazingly, upon entering Qin Sang's meridians, the two liquids intertwine into a single stream, flowing into his dantian together.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The familiar storm surges again, though not as violently as before.</p><p>The medicinal power of these two herbs is not only gentle but also far more long-lasting than that of the Kanli Golden Pill.</p><p>Once assured that his dantian is unharmed, Qin Sang enters a state of deep meditation, focusing on his cultivation.</p><p>The Spirit Eye continuously emits rich spiritual energy.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid in the jade pool remains still.</p><p>A lone cultivator meditates in peaceful cultivation.</p><p>A scene of tranquility.</p><p>Unfortunately, this peaceful scene lasted for over ten days, and shows no signs of ending.</p><p>The legendary convergence of heaven and earth, the clash of the elements, never materialized.</p><p>Twenty days is enough.</p><p>Qin Sang opens his eyes, profound disappointment in their depths.</p><p>He gives up. There's no point continuing.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower are extremely potent, far better than the Kanli Golden Pill.  Truly top-tier herbs known for their immense aid in Golden Core formation.</p><p>But they did not bring Qin Sang good fortune.</p><p>He did gain some understanding, some harvest. But the crucial aspect—spiritual energy condensation—only showed the slightest hint, the medicinal power quickly exhausting itself.</p><p>Twenty days, like a fleeting dream.</p><p>[Read books to earn cash] Follow the vx public account [Book Friends Base Camp] to earn cash while reading!</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower having failed, Qin Sang wonders what other herbs could help him.</p><p>Relying on herbs alone is practically impossible.  Herbs inferior to the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower would have even weaker effects.  For instance, pills one rank below the Kanli Golden Pill are useless to him.</p><p>How many could he obtain even if he spent all his wealth?</p><p>Moreover, the effectiveness of these pills assisting in Golden Core formation is significantly reduced upon second use.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>A soft sigh echoes in the dim cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sits at the edge of the pool, gazing at the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, motionless, lost in thought. He remains there for a whole day.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Qin Sang appears composed, seemingly having forgotten yesterday's setback. Leaving his treasures and iron rings in the cave, he flies on a cloud towards Mount Shaohua.</p><p>…</p><p>It seems the Snake Granny’s words were true.  The situation between the Xiaohan Region and the Tianxing League has eased. The protective formation of Mount Shaohua has been deactivated, and the disciples guarding and patrolling have been withdrawn.</p><p>Qin Sang faces no obstacles.  Upon entering the mountain gate, he heads directly towards Qi Yuanshou’s cave.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou returned the main peak to the current sect leader, choosing instead to reside on a secluded peak of Shao Hua Mountain.  His disciple, Gao Yang, remained there, practicing alongside him.</p><p>The peak wasn't high, but it possessed a remarkable spiritual aura.  Its location, directly on a major vein of the mountain's spiritual energy, made the spiritual qi within surpass even the famed Lingquan Cave of Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, a green peak appeared, veiled in mist. Qin Sang slowed his flight, gently landing at the foot of the mountain.  Dispersing the cloud around his feet, he adjusted his robes, bowed respectfully towards the summit, and announced loudly,</p><p>"Disciple Qin Sang, greets Master Uncle Qi."</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>As Qin Sang's voice faded, the mist above swirled, parting to reveal a small path.  A figure then descended swiftly on a sword, landing gracefully before him.  The sword's glow briefly enveloped the figure before vanishing.</p><p>"Disciple Gao's swordsmanship has become even more refined," Qin Sang complimented.</p><p>"Thanks to the precious sword Senior Brother gifted me!"</p><p>Gao Yang, having constantly trained with Qi Yuanshou, hadn't changed much in appearance or demeanor.  Greeting Qin Sang warmly, he spoke frankly, "Senior Brother Qin, Master is currently in seclusion. Before entering seclusion, he explicitly forbade any disturbance. Unless it's urgent, perhaps you could wait a while.  Once Master emerges, I will report your arrival immediately…"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak, but at that moment, a strange expression flickered across Gao Yang's face.  He became serious, listening intently.  After a moment, he bowed towards the summit, saying, "Disciple obeys."</p><p>He then turned, excitedly urging Qin Sang, "Senior Brother, hurry! Master wishes to see you. He just sent a message, instructing you to go directly."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Gao Yang, and using swift movements, headed towards Qi Yuanshou's cave dwelling.</p><p>He arrived shortly, only to find the entrance sealed shut, with no sign of Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was puzzled, a voice emanated from within the cave.</p><p>"Have you consumed the Xue Ling Lotus and Iris flower?"</p><p>Qin Sang stood firm before the entrance, bowing deeply, replying, "Disciple greets Master Uncle Qi.  Reporting to Master Uncle Qi, the disciple has refined both herbs."</p><p>From within the cave, Qi Yuanshou uttered a single "Hmm," then after a thoughtful pause, said calmly,  "Very well.  It provides a suitable explanation to the other masters…"</p><p>A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>He realized that the Xue Ling Lotus and Iris flower were being closely watched, even by the Golden Core masters within the sect.  These herbs were extremely rare, even difficult for Golden Core cultivators to obtain.  They might not need them personally, but they could use them for their own disciples or family.</p>
