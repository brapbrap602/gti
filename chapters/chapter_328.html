Chapter 321: The Secret Market


Finally, Qin Sang obtained the auction token from Manager Pu. Following the manager's instructions, he rested at the Spirit Pill Pavilion for a few days before departing Yinshan Pass three days early, heading towards Stone Island.

Along the way, he saw other cultivators flying towards the same destination. However, unlike the orderly Yinshan Pass, there were no guards here to maintain order. Everyone remained wary of each other, avoiding unnecessary interaction.

Qin Sang piloted his Sky Shuttle, flying discreetly beneath the treetops, lost in thought.

The Sky Shuttle, a high-grade magical artifact he'd acquired during his Qi Refining stage, had served him well then, but now felt somewhat slow, wasting valuable time.

This thought had first occurred to him during his journey from Xuanguan Pass.

For long journeys, speed and comfort necessitated the use of artifacts like the Sky Shuttle. Continuously flying on his sword or activating the Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman, while faster, consumed too much spiritual energy to be sustainable.

Over the years, Qin Sang hadn't found a suitable replacement, but this trade fair presented an opportunity. He decided to look carefully for an upgrade to his Sky Shuttle.

He also planned to purchase more spiritwood.

Of course, the Soul-Guiding Herb remained his top priority. Everything else was secondary, dependent on chance.

After flying through the swamp for a while, Qin Sang noticed the fog thinning ahead, signaling his arrival at Stone Island. He urged the Sky Shuttle upwards, rising above the mist.

From above, the swamp's fog resembled a vast, boundless sea of clouds.

The weather was somewhat gloomy, but visibility remained excellent in all directions. Apart from the occasional treetop poking through the fog, nothing obstructed his view.

Few dared to fly above the fog, making themselves obvious targets, unless they were exceptionally confident in their abilities.

Qin Sang cautiously scanned his surroundings before turning his gaze forward.

Not far ahead, a large, perfectly circular opening appeared abruptly in the otherwise uniform fog, devoid of any mist.

As the thick fog rolled towards the opening, it was repelled by an invisible barrier, forced to flow downwards, creating a ring-shaped 'waterfall' of fog around the edge of the opening.

A constant, endless flow.

The scene was truly spectacular.

Stone Island lay beneath the opening, but direct flight was impossible.

Qin Sang descended back into the fog.  After flying forward for a distance, a peculiar force pressed upon him, attempting to push him outwards.

The force wasn't strong, consistent with Manager Pu's description. Any cultivator above the tenth level of Qi Refining could withstand it.

Spiritual energy surged through Qin Sang, easily countering the pressure.  Soon, he felt a sudden lightness as the fog dispersed before him, revealing an island.

Composed entirely of black stone, the island resembled a turtle's shell resting in the center of the swamp, devoid of vegetation.

Rows of neatly arranged stone houses dotted the island, surrounding a grand, imposing building at its center. The auction would be held within this building.

Numerous cultivators bustled about the island, moving between the stone houses, conducting trades.

Donning a hooded cloak to conceal his face, Qin Sang landed on the island. A few cultivators glanced at him before returning to their own affairs. Qin Sang began to stroll leisurely among the stone houses.

Spirit-infused artifacts, magical tools, cultivation manuals…

Everything was available.

Due to the island's protective formation, only cultivators of a certain strength could enter, ensuring that the items on offer were of considerable quality.

However, few things caught Qin Sang's eye.

After wandering for a while, Qin Sang felt disappointed. He hadn't seen a single top-tier flying artifact. There was some spiritwood, but its quality was inferior to even Golden Silk Snow Cedar, which now offered negligible improvement to his Ebony Sword.  Purchasing it would be a waste of spirit stones.

It was to be expected. Few would bring truly valuable items to such a casual market.

After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang decided to stop wasting time.  He walked towards the end of the street, stopping before an inconspicuous stone house.

The house bore no sign, and its interior was empty save for a white-haired elder dozing alone.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist."

Qin Sang entered the stone house and bowed, gently waking the elder.

The elder rose and returned the greeting, then waved his hand, activating the house's protective formation.  "Apologies for my inattention, fellow Daoist.  I have no magical tools or pills for sale here. What brings you to my humble abode?"

Qin Sang smiled faintly. "To be frank, I was informed by a friend that you have a way of connecting fellow Daoists for discreet exchanges. I've come seeking your guidance."

The elder responded with an "Oh," scrutinizing Qin Sang without asking him to remove his cloak. Stroking his long beard, he said, "Since you know of my role, you must have been referred by an acquaintance.  However… rules are rules, regardless of cultivation level. You see…"

Mid-sentence, the elder noticed three small spirit swords resting in Qin Sang's outstretched palm.

These were the swords he'd obtained from Dai Yue and his companions. All were top-grade artifacts, but varied in power. The Scarred Man's sword was among the finest of its kind.

Possessing the Ebony Sword, Qin Sang had no immediate use for these and had long decided to trade them.

This elder organized a private market whenever Stone Island opened for trade. He possessed certain skills, and his market had a good reputation.

To participate, one needed either a direct invitation from the elder or to demonstrate sufficient "strength" to earn his approval.

Qin Sang had learned of the elder's role from Manager Pu and had come seeking him out.

"Are these sufficient?"

Qin Sang asked with a smile.

The elder's eyes brightened at the sight of three top-grade artifacts.  "More than enough! More than enough! Here, take this jade pendant…"

The elder handed him a jade pendant.

"The auction hasn't begun, and not everyone has arrived. I've decided to hold the private market after the auction concludes. The location hasn't been determined yet. Please remain on the island for an extra day after the auction.  Infuse the jade pendant with spiritual energy to receive guidance."

The elder explained the pendant's usage in detail.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist." Qin Sang accepted the pendant, bid farewell to the elder, and exited the stone house.

After another round of browsing, acquiring only two minor artifacts with unique properties, Qin Sang lost interest and rented a quiet room on the island.

Three days passed quickly.

As night fell, Qin Sang opened his eyes and stepped outside.

The grand building in the center of the island was brilliantly lit, and cultivators were already gathering at its entrance.  The auction was about to begin!
