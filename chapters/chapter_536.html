<h1>Chapter 529: The Leap</h1><p>Chapter 529: The Leap</p><p>Qin Sang gave the vortex a lingering look before turning and leaving.</p><p>He hadn't gone far when he felt something amiss within him.  Unable to delay, he found a secluded spot and sat down, legs crossed.</p><p>He had been forced to borrow the power of the Ancestral Sacred Fire to trap those two, interrupting his  Dan breakthrough. It was a risky move, but Qin Sang had no choice.</p><p>Indeed, only three breaths had passed since the battle began, and he was already struggling to maintain control.  He could feel his Golden Core nearing its limit.</p><p>Thankfully, the Golden Core had retained its spiritual essence; otherwise, he wouldn't have lasted this long.</p><p>Those two were trapped in the vortex. Even if other cultivators from the Qingyang Demon Sect came to investigate, they wouldn't be able to save them – only fret helplessly.</p><p>They'd likely have to wait for a Qingyang Demon Sect Golden Core cultivator to return. Whether those two could hold out that long was another matter.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to seize this opportunity to complete the final step!</p><p>He absorbed the remaining fragments of the Qingyang Divine Gang into his body, then channeled his Gang Qi into his dantian.  His dantian was now nearly empty, with only a small amount of Earth煞 Qi remaining, roughly equal to the incoming Gang Qi, but enough.</p><p>He enveloped both with spiritual energy and slammed them into his Golden Core!</p><p>Simultaneously, using the last of his spiritual energy, he activated the ebony sword, unleashing a powerful sword energy that enveloped the Golden Core.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The three forces collided, using the Golden Core as a battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang's dantian violently shook.  A wave of nausea washed over him, but he gritted his teeth, enduring the excruciating pain, quickly completing the final hand seal. Then, he used inner vision to anxiously observe the changes in his Golden Core.</p><p>His dantian was empty, except for a single Golden Core suspended in midair, spinning rapidly.  The last sliver of the core, tainted by black and green energies, was consumed, then vanished.</p><p>The Golden Core had transformed into a bizarre, greenish-black pill!</p><p>Was it done?</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with doubt.  According to the secret technique for creating the Flying Night Rakshasa, the core breakthrough was complete, signifying the creation of the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>But Qin Sang hesitated, unsure of success or failure.</p><p>He wasn't even sure what to call this Golden Core.</p><p>煞 Core?</p><p>Gang煞 Core?</p><p>Or, following the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*, should he call it a Corpse Core?</p><p>For now, he would call it a Corpse Core.</p><p>The good news was that, unlike the Flying Night Rakshasa, the Corpse Core didn't release a torrent of煞 Qi, violently surging through his meridians. Although it would refine his body, it would also cause catastrophic damage and irreversible corpse transformation.</p><p>But here, the Corpse Core lay quietly in Qin Sang's dantian, completely still, making it even more unnerving!</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang tried to use his spiritual sense to touch the Corpse Core.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment his spiritual sense made contact, the Corpse Core trembled violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's face fell, but he was helpless. The Corpse Core was completely beyond his control.</p><p>He anxiously watched as the clearly distinct colors on the Corpse Core began to blend, quickly assimilating into each other, finally becoming a uniformly dark greenish-black pill!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a connection form between him and the Corpse Core, and the Core began to calm down rapidly!</p><p>As Qin Sang focused his mind, a strange energy surged from the Corpse Core. He couldn't control it yet, but it felt surprisingly gentle.</p><p>After a cultivator successfully forms their Golden Core, whether they are a devil cultivator, an evil cultivator, a righteous cultivator, or something else, the refined energy is no longer simply spiritual energy; it's called True Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively classified the energy from the Corpse Core as True Essence, but it was quite strange.  It contained煞 Qi, Gang Qi, and even the corpse Qi from the secret technique, all fused together.</p><p>Wu Shang's concept of Gang Qi clashing with煞 Qi had come true!</p><p>The originally volatile Earth煞 Qi and the Qian Tian Gang Qi, after mutual constraint and fusion, had surprisingly calmed down, unlike the Flying Night Rakshasa, which had rampaged through his body.</p><p>He carefully guided this True Essence into his meridians, following the techniques of the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely nervous, fearing that the True Essence might suddenly turn violent and damage his body, but after a complete cycle, the True Essence remained perfectly calm.</p><p>Seeing this, a huge weight lifted from Qin Sang's heart.  He sunk his mind into the Corpse Core, savoring the feeling, completely captivated.</p><p>Qin Sang still couldn't fully control the Corpse Core, needing more time to become one with it. But he sensed the immense power within the Corpse Core, far surpassing his previous cultivation.</p><p>This wasn't just an improvement; it was a transformation!</p><p>A quantum leap!</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang grinned, a surge of exhilaration coursing through him. He abruptly stood.</p><p>This wasn't a safe place to practice controlling his Corpse Pill. The Qingyang Sect's Golden Core cultivator had been gone for two hours.  With the disturbance on Shen Gang Peak, he'd surely return much sooner.</p><p>Qin Sang's Corpse Pill was newly formed. He couldn't risk fighting a true Golden Core cultivator. His priority was to leave Qingyang Sect and find a secluded spot to master the Corpse Pill.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang turned and darted down the mountain. He glanced at the vortex but ignored it, heading straight downhill.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, he sensed many cultivators, clearly drawn by the disturbance on Shen Gang Peak.  Although he hadn't fully mastered the Corpse Pill, concealing his aura with his true energy was manageable.</p><p>None of these cultivators were powerful, so he wasn't worried about being discovered.</p><p>He slipped away from Shen Gang Peak effortlessly, not looking back as he headed towards the Qingyang Sect gates, strategizing a surprise escape.</p><p>The inner sect was sparsely guarded; the few powerful cultivators had been drawn to Shen Gang Peak.  Qin Sang judged his escape wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>But he had to flee immediately after escaping and avoid lingering near Qingyang Sect. As he moved, he used his spiritual sense to connect with the Corpse Pill, striving to master its power and control more true energy.</p><p>To his surprise, his progress was far faster than Yu Hua's had been. Yu Hua had taken two full days to achieve complete unity of body and pill and fully control his Corpse Pill.</p><p>Was it because he was actively mastering the Corpse Pill, unlike Yu Hua who was working through a soul imprint? Or was it because true energy was milder than demonic energy, making it easier to control?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure, and didn't dwell on it.</p><p>The inner sect's defenses were lax. Qin Sang avoided a patrol of disciples and easily reached the outer gate. He used his speed to quickly approach the main gate.</p><p>After traversing mountains and valleys, he finally arrived at the gate.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped, his eyes darkening as he stared at the peak shrouded in clouds.</p><p>Qingyang Sect had sealed the gates!</p><p>Had the gates been open, he could have infiltrated the gate area and made a surprise dash for freedom – nobody could have stopped him.</p><p>Now, he dared not make a rash move.</p><p>Even a true Golden Core cultivator wouldn't be able to escape unscathed if they tried to force their way through the barrier!</p>
