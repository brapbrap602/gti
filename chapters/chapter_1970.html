<h1>Chapter 1961: A Nation in Turmoil</h1><p>“嘤嘤……”</p><p>Xiao Wu looked down at the white fox in her arms.</p><p>She released her aura, and the fox clearly recognized her.  It was the little fox she had kept during her time at the old Lei Xiao Sect site.</p><p>For fifteen years, Qin Sang had been mostly in seclusion, cultivating within the Thunder Altar. Zhuque and Luo Hou were somewhat afraid of her, so she was mostly kept company by the small animals brought into the mountains by the spirit formation.</p><p>Among them, the fox had been her companion for the longest time and was also the most intelligent.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang had asked Xiao Wu if she wanted to take the fox with her, but Xiao Wu had refused.  She hadn't expected to reunite with it under these circumstances.</p><p>The woman and fox gazed at each other.</p><p>The fox's eyes were full of surprise, appearing even more spirited than before.</p><p>Xiao Wu reached out and gently stroked the fox's head.</p><p>“唧唧!”</p><p>The fox cried out, closing its eyes in a contented, familiar way.</p><p>The mountain wind whistled through the trees.</p><p>The breeze was gentle, warm sunlight fell upon them, and the wind whispered in their ears.</p><p>It felt like old times.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression softened.  She looked around, sensing her location. She had unknowingly flown out of Yan and was over unfamiliar land.</p><p>Where should she go next?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xiao Wu had a destination in mind—the Yan capital, by Jade Waist Lake, at the Green Sheep Tea House.</p><p>She still had unanswered questions, but she wasn't worried. She trusted she would find answers in due time.</p><p>White clouds drifted lazily.</p><p>Xiao Wu traveled on a cloud, the white fox nestled in her arms.</p><p>From time to time, a fox's cry echoed from the clouds, as if narrating its life's journey.</p><p>Upon returning to the Green Sheep Tea House, a Qin family servant was waiting. He immediately rushed back to the estate.</p><p>Soon, Yu Lang arrived in a hurry.</p><p>Upon learning the truth, the last of Yu Lang's hope vanished.</p><p>The Master had devoted his life to the people. After death, his spirit might have condensed into spiritual light, ascending to divinity.</p><p>But on the battlefield, unless guided immediately after death, a fragile soul couldn't withstand the overwhelming bloodlust and evil energy; it would either be scattered or corrupted into an evil spirit.</p><p>Xiao Wu gave Yu Lang the letter left by Chen Zhenqing.  The eight characters were few, but Yu Lang studied them for a long time before carefully putting them away.  He then stood up and said, "Senior Sister, I must go."</p><p>"Alright," Xiao Wu stood up to see him off. She sealed her and the fox's cultivation, returning to their mortal forms.</p><p>Leaving the teahouse, Yu Lang paused, gazing towards the imperial palace.  He said solemnly, "I will make Yan far stronger than Liang. We will defeat them honorably on the battlefield, to commemorate the Master!"</p><p>Urgent reports reached the capital, shaking the court.</p><p>Simultaneously, various factions within the capital were stirring.</p><p>Liang's attack was so perfectly timed, it was hard not to suspect foul play.</p><p>Yu Lang and the Crown Prince's faction had already noticed some irregularities. A storm was brewing, and some matters would soon come to a head.</p><p>Yu Lang tightened his robe, took a deep breath, and vanished into the darkness.</p><p>…</p><p>From that day on, the patrons of the Green Sheep Tea House noticed a lazy white fox appearing from nowhere. Sometimes it lay on the proprietress's lap, sometimes on the counter, always by her side, languidly ignoring the patrons' attempts to interact with it, rewarding them only with disdainful glances.</p><p>The patrons were amused, charmed by the fox's spirit.</p><p>However, the patrons soon lost interest in the white fox.</p><p>News of Liang's invasion and the crisis at the border reached the capital, causing widespread panic.</p><p>In a short time, Yan lost eight prefectures in Luzhou. Liang's army was unstoppable, Yan's defenders retreated repeatedly, and Luzhou was almost entirely lost.  Neighboring prefectures were terrified, sending urgent pleas for help, and the situation worsened by the day.</p><p>…</p><p>"And at this very moment, the Emperor's illness worsens, and he's incapable of ruling.  Memorials are submitted but met with silence, left unaddressed."</p><p>Amidst his busy schedule, Yu Lang returned to the tea house.  As always, he shared the complex situation and his plans with Xiao Wu without reservation.</p><p>"Yan is in trouble both internally and externally. The Crown Prince lacks authority, the princes are scheming against each other, the officials are hesitant, and the court is rife with endless debates, delaying decisive action!"</p><p>Yu Lang sighed wearily.</p><p>Even as a cultivator with abundant energy, he felt overwhelmed by the pressures of power.</p><p>……</p><p>"Beyond Yan's borders, other nations are starting to make moves..."</p><p>"Finally, the decision has been made to dispatch a large army, unfortunately I cannot personally lead the troops east!"</p><p>……</p><p>"I've found some clues. As expected, one of the princes must be collaborating with Liang, working together from inside and outside! Taking advantage of Yan's internal strife and external threats to seize the throne!"</p><p>Yu Lang's tone grew colder.</p><p>"There was a disturbance in the palace.  The imperial guards under Tao Teng were secretly called into the palace at night, almost failing to send out a message."</p><p>……</p><p>An ordinary morning.</p><p>The capital streets suddenly filled with many soldiers, hurrying through the streets.  The clatter of armor echoed through the city.</p><p>Ordinary citizens sensed an impending storm and closed their doors.</p><p>All the hidden currents suddenly erupted that day!</p><p>It was later reported.</p><p>That night, the palace was ablaze, burning throughout the night.</p><p>Fires erupted throughout the capital, the cries of battle shook the heavens, countless residences were burned and destroyed, many families vanished overnight.</p><p>The city gates were closed, crossbows were prepared, aimed outwards.</p><p>At some point, a large army appeared outside the city, and the style of their armor was almost identical to that of the city's defenders.</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>Fellow citizens of Yan, turned against each other like enemies.</p><p>……</p><p>The next day.</p><p>At dawn.</p><p>The capital, chaotic throughout the night, returned to calm.</p><p>Yu Lang, covered in blood, arrived at the Green Sheep Tea House.</p><p>Outside the tea house, he removed his armor, jumped into the Jade Waist Lake, washing away the blood, changed into civilian clothes, and once again became a refined young gentleman.</p><p>Xiao Wu, holding the little fox, came down from the second floor.</p><p>"Was it successful?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Yu Lang affirmed, his expression not one of excitement, but rather of relief.</p><p>He had journeyed down the mountain, traveled for a year, studied for three years, and served as an official for eleven years after becoming the top scholar, never daring to relax, carefully planning every step, finally reaching this day!</p><p>He had almost become accustomed to secular life, only when meeting his senior sister did he recall the past, reminding himself of his true identity and origins.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the Third Prince escaped.  We miscalculated; he is the mastermind behind the collusion with Liang. The Second Prince was used without knowing it, pitiful and sad!"</p><p>Yu Lang took a sip of tea, shaking his head and sighing softly.</p><p>"The late Emperor was wise, he had made preparations. The Emperor's ascension to the throne was smoother than expected.  Because of this, the Third Prince retreated decisively when he saw the situation was unfavorable. Many of his forces haven't yet surfaced, and surely won't give up.</p><p>"However, the Emperor's succession is legitimate, and the hearts of the people are with him. Even if the Third Prince spreads false rumors, he won't be able to cause too much trouble.  The worry is that he will continue to conspire with Liang, plotting against the country, and the people will be the ones to suffer.</p><p>"Next, Yan will face internal strife and external threats. Tao Teng and I have discussed this, and we plan to have one of us stay in the capital while the other goes out to quell the rebellion."</p><p>……</p><p>"Inappropriate!"</p><p>In the imperial study, the new Emperor decisively rejected the proposal.</p><p>"I know you are both civil and military, skilled in martial arts, but the battlefield is unforgiving. You should remain in the court, strategizing!  Yuan Guogong and others will lead the troops to quell the rebellion and repel the enemy."</p><p>As expected, not long after escaping the city, the Third Prince raised his banner in Yingzhou, in the northern part of Luzhou, which also borders Liang, declaring himself Emperor, claiming that the false Emperor is ambitious, imprisoned the late Emperor, forged edicts, and illegitimately seized power.</p><p>Besides the Third Prince, several other escaped princes responded in various states, forming a considerable force, causing unrest among the people of Yan.</p><p>Coincidentally, Liang attacked Yingzhou at this time, but suddenly stopped its offensive, remaining stationary, acting not like an enemy, but rather as if boosting the Third Prince's power.</p><p>After the court meeting, Tao Teng and Yu Lang were summoned to the imperial study again to discuss quelling the rebellion.</p><p>Tao Teng stepped forward and said: "A true minister can be a minister when dismounted and a general when mounted!  The top scholar is a divine being, his prestige among scholars is unmatched. When the people see the top scholar on the battlefield, they will know what is orthodox and what is a traitor, and as they say, those who have virtue will receive help, while those who lose virtue will have no help.  We will easily eliminate the rebel army.”</p><p>"I am willing to relieve the Emperor’s worries and do my part," Yu Lang also said.</p><p>The Emperor paced back and forth, sighing softly, "Qin, you must be careful! You two are pillars of the state and my two wings. The loss of either of you would be a loss for Yan, and a loss for me!"</p><p>Then, the Emperor picked up a scroll from the desk and said: "Chen Fufeng sacrificed his life for the country, and I have always kept that in mind. I have decided to posthumously bestow the title of Marquis of Loyalty upon him, to be inherited by his descendants. What do you two think?"</p><p>The two rejoiced, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p>……</p><p>In the military tent.</p><p>Yu Lang, clad in armor, sat upright like a statue, reviewing a stack of urgent reports and letters.  Several strong, capable men stood at attention before him.</p><p>One of them exclaimed angrily, "The surrender offer was thrown into the city and burned by the rebel commander, who then openly insulted us! This man is stubbornly resisting, oblivious to the consequences.  When do we attack, General?"</p><p>Yu Lang listened to his subordinate's report, a flicker of doubt crossing his eyes. He hadn't gone directly to Yingzhou; the Emperor had sent him elsewhere to quell the rebellion.  Those other areas were unlike Yingzhou, which had the powerful Liang Kingdom as an ally.  These other areas only had conscripted local militia and hastily assembled young men, their equipment still incomplete.  His Imperial Army's arrival should have been met with immediate surrender, sweeping through the enemy like autumn winds clearing fallen leaves.</p><p>The reality was vastly different.  He led one army to attack Youyang Prefecture, with two deputy generals commanding the other two, all three advancing together, yet all met with fierce resistance.</p><p>Rising in rebellion was a grave crime for the Yi people!  Surrender meant amnesty, yet the garrisons of all three cities fought to the death.  The prince they followed could never withstand the Imperial Army's strength, unless the Third Prince arrived from Yingzhou with reinforcements – otherwise, defeat was inevitable.</p><p>Suddenly, Yu Lang's mind stirred. A commoner might not have considered this, but as a cultivator who had descended from the mountains, he instinctively probed deeper into this illogical situation.</p><p>What power made these rebels fearless of death?  He thought of Tao Teng and himself.  The city god of Yan's capital had allowed them to enter the mortal realm; could it have allowed other cultivators in, disguised as commoners?  Yu Lang had felt then that the city god had been too lenient.  With the jade pendant the city god gifted, unless he chose to reveal himself, even his brother Shi wouldn't be able to tell if they were cultivators or mortals.</p><p>During the struggle for the throne, Yu Lang hadn't detected any soldiers who were obviously cultivators.  It seemed that within the imperial palace, under the city god's very gaze, no one dared act rashly.  But outside the capital, mundane methods weren't working, and finally, someone couldn't resist, eager for chaos.</p><p>Yu Lang frowned. Unfortunately, his senior sister had sealed her cultivation, and Shi was claiming a bottleneck and needed a period of seclusion. Otherwise, if there were cultivators among the rebels, their identities would be easily discovered.</p><p>"Report, General," another urgent message arrived.  "Yingzhou reports that the false emperor's momentum has suddenly weakened, opting to hold the city. The Liang army within our territory is also hesitant. Not only has Liang not sent reinforcements, there are signs of troops secretly returning home, as if something has happened domestically..."</p><p>Yu Lang looked at the letters on his desk. This was expected.  The Liang emperor was several years older than the late Yan emperor and was nearing his end, bound to trigger a power struggle. The current Emperor was planning to use their own tactics against them. Yu Lang had earlier lamented the Liang emperor's shrewdness – striking first, sending troops to destabilize Yan, leaving Liang free to deal with internal issues and preventing Yan from exploiting the weakness.</p><p>A sudden thought flooded Yu Lang's mind, and he felt a cold sweat break out. This power struggle affecting two nations – was it really as simple as it seemed? How many cultivators were secretly involved, and what were their goals?  Were they, like himself and Tao Teng, pursuing ambition, playing in the mortal realm, or did they have other plans?</p><p>What were the Yan ghosts' intentions? And Tao Teng's master, whom he had never had the chance to visit – what was their background?</p><p>Yu Lang inexplicably felt restless, rising from his seat and pacing the tent.  It felt as if an invisible hand held him, Tao Teng, the Emperor, the officials, the common people – the entire Yan Kingdom!</p><p>Yu Lang unconsciously opened his mouth. A dark cloud seemed to perpetually hang in the sky, like the tent's canvas, pressing down, ever lower, suffocating him.  That dark cloud was the world of cultivators.</p><p>…</p><p>The mortal world was in turmoil. The cultivator world was also far from peaceful.</p><p>In southwest Yan, mountains were steep and valleys were deep. Within the dense forest, mist swirled, like white clouds enveloping the peaks, stretching endlessly, dissipating only around noon, before reforming in the afternoon.  Through the mist, several figures moved slowly.  They stood upon a bamboo-leaf-shaped artifact, radiating a faint green glow that enveloped them, concealing their movement.  Even with the artifact's protection, they flew very low, almost skimming the forest floor.</p><p>At the forefront, piloting the artifact, was Yin Heqian, the head of the Yin family.  Those behind him were all Yin family experts. Yin Qiao'er, lacking sufficient cultivation, was not present, but her aunt, Nian Hui, was among them.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>I was tipsy the last few days, woke up this morning in a jolt and quickly wrote this.</p><p></p>
