<h1>Chapter 1710: After the Fact</h1><p>It took only seventy years to achieve perfect cultivation, which even Qin Sang found unexpected.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's breathing was steady as he slowly finished his cultivation.</p><p>He looked down at the Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array beneath him.</p><p>The array hadn't reached its limit, but the cracks on the array plate had more than doubled since he obtained it. The four saintly figures engraved on it were torn apart by countless cracks, their true forms indistinguishable.</p><p>Returning them to their original appearance as statues might cause them to shatter instantly.</p><p>Having experienced the powerful effects of the Four Saints Gathering Spirit Array, Qin Sang wanted to understand it and refine a new one, but the results were unsatisfactory.</p><p>Perhaps his realm wasn't high enough.  He forcefully memorized all the runes and details of the Gathering Spirit Array, intending to continue comprehending it later.</p><p>A faint light flickered.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew out of his dantian, dancing around Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the butterfly's affection, Qin Sang's expression softened. His rapid progress also benefited the butterfly, which constantly followed in its master's footsteps.</p><p>The spirit herbs prepared for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly were depleted. His current mission was to find more, hoping to quickly push the butterfly to the peak of the late fourth transformation.</p><p>His cultivation was complete, with nowhere further to go.</p><p>Qin Sang's next goals were clear: besides refining the Taiji Immortal Stage and the Ice and Fire Order, and preparing for the tribulation array, his focus would be on cultivation.</p><p>First, he would seek what's known as heavenly human resonance.</p><p>Heavenly human resonance was a profound mystery. Qin Sang had searched through many books in the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and consulted the Liuli about the treasures in the Yan Yue Temple, but there wasn't much information about the ascension to the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Of course, no amount of texts could compare to the major sects.  Their generational inheritance and consistent cultivation methods meant some experiences could be passed down orally.</p><p>For example, someone at this stage in the Ganlu Zen Monastery could directly consult the Holy Venerable Huiguang, avoiding pitfalls and saving considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered asking Venerable Huiguang for guidance, indirectly probing through his avatar and Master Xingji.</p><p>To his surprise, the Ganlu Zen Monastery didn't seem to reject this outsider.</p><p>Instead, Qin Sang was hesitant.  He worried about being subjected to harsh conditions, even if he succeeded in the Divine Transformation, and being controlled by them. He also worried that, not being a Buddhist, their experiences might not be applicable, possibly even misleading him.</p><p>If Venerable Huiguang had malicious intent, it would be even worse!</p><p>A casual remark could create an obstacle to his understanding.</p><p>Even among fellow disciples, such exchanges were limited.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang decided to try it himself first.</p><p>According to the grotesque-faced man, with his five spiritual roots, finding heavenly human resonance would be easier than for others.</p><p>Second, he needed to search for spirit herbs to help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly break through, which would in turn benefit him.</p><p>Breaking through himself or helping his innate insect break through—either path would suffice.</p><p>The auxiliary herbs for the Qingshuang Pill had been partially collected by Mingyue Wei and his avatar, but the three main herbs were still missing, and he didn't have a second vial of Qingluan essence blood to feed the butterfly.</p><p>It seemed that helping the butterfly break through would be harder than his own breakthrough.</p><p>Third, he would resume practicing the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*. With his spirit, energy, and essence complete, he could replicate the process of forming a nascent soul, now only lacking a physical body.</p><p>His goals were clear, and he should have proceeded step by step.</p><p>However, at this time, the Wusheng Demon Seal showed an unexpected change.</p><p>Others who cultivated the *Wusheng Demon Seal* had to carefully calculate the frequency of infusing their obsessions, matching it with their breakthroughs and the completion of the obsession.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely reckless, pouring obsessions into the seal whenever he had free time.</p><p>Now, this secret technique was not yet at its peak, but it was not far from it.</p><p>Qin Sang had reached the threshold of the Divine Transformation stage.  On a whim, he tried to activate the technique and sense the embryonic form of the seal, to see if it truly had the effect of breaking through.</p><p>The result, however, shocked Qin Sang; he couldn't believe it!</p><p>The technique was not yet perfected, the seal still only an embryo, and the crucial step of condensation was incomplete, yet Qin Sang felt a stirring, a strange sensation.</p><p>He sensed a mysterious energy connecting the seal to himself; each time he touched it, the true essence in his body surged.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind returned to his body, his expression somewhat stunned.</p><p>If his perception wasn't wrong, the demon seal he had condensed from external demons not only had the same breakthrough effect, but its power seemed to far exceed what Senior Sister Qingjun had described!</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang felt like he had been struck by a bolt from the blue!</p><p>According to previous information, except for some special circumstances, cultivators' ascension to Divine Transformation generally followed two paths.</p><p>First, cultivate oneself and reflect it onto the world, seeking breakthrough from the inside out.  Most Heaven-Spirit Root geniuses choose this path. The *Unsurpassed Demon Seal*’s refinement, shattering, and breakthrough all represent self-transformation and thus belong to this category.</p><p>Second, pursue harmony between Heaven and Man, and then reflect on oneself.</p><p>Qin Sang is clearly better suited to the second path, and this is how he planned it: primarily pursuing harmony with Heaven and Man, while using the *Unsurpassed Demon Seal* to assist his breakthrough.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the *Unsurpassed Demon Seal* produced a variable.</p><p>“If the *Unsurpassed Demon Seal’s* effect far exceeds expectations, could my Five-Spirit Root aptitude actually allow me to take the first path?  Or even progress on both paths simultaneously?  If that’s the case, the chances of success would be…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, incredulous.</p><p>Even with his temperament, he couldn’t calm his turbulent thoughts.</p><p>Looking back, from Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, to Nascent Soul, each stage was harder than the last.  When had things ever gone smoothly?</p><p>This world's most difficult Transcendence stage has trapped countless heroes for countless years, even the Daoist leader, Purple Thunder True Person, fell before this hurdle. Yet, I have obtained such a great opportunity.</p><p>It feels like a dream!</p><p>Having weathered many storms, Qin Sang quickly suppressed his distractions and pondered the reasons for the change in the *Unsurpassed Demon Seal*.</p><p>His senior sister Qing Jun had no reason to deceive him, and the secret technique's records indicate that the seal's power has limits. It shouldn't be this strong.</p><p>“Did this change occur because I used an outer demon instead of an inner demon? Is the demonic intent of the extra-territorial demon far stronger than that of a heart demon? Or…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, a flash of insight striking his mind. He recalled the incident during the ritual, “The source of the demonic intent, the rank of that extra-territorial demon, also affects the seal's effect? That demonic intent was swift and powerful…”</p><p>If that were the reason, it was rather terrifying.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture* only channeled a wisp of demonic intent, not even a fragment of thought from the extra-territorial demon.  A mere Void Refinement level extra-territorial demon probably wouldn’t have such a significant effect.</p><p>“Did I, by some incredibly small chance, encounter a powerful extra-territorial demon? What kind of being did I actually channel?”</p><p>Was this misfortune or good fortune?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel a chill.</p><p>If not for the jade Buddha's protection, he would have died on the altar.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn’t been arrogant and promptly terminated the ritual, cutting the connection.</p><p>Though powerful, the jade Buddha only protected his soul, blocking attacks on his spirit, but an extra-territorial demon wouldn't only use manipulation of the heart demon.  Just as spiritual cultivators don't solely use their spiritual sense to attack an opponent's soul, there are various unpredictable supernatural powers.</p><p>If that extra-territorial demon was a Unity Transformation level being or even more terrifying, there were countless ways to make Qin Sang suffer a living hell!</p><p>Qin Sang sat still, pondering for a long time.</p><p>The seal wasn’t yet complete; it was too early to celebrate.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't help but imagine the future.</p><p>If the seal's power truly was that strong, he wouldn't even need to pursue the perfection of spirit, energy, and mind. He could rely entirely on the seal, the Spirit-Awakening Immortal Fruit, and his innate insect gu to assist his breakthrough.</p><p>This would greatly save time.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* has been stagnant for many years, only at the early stage of transformation.  To improve it, who knows how long it would take, comparable to the time spent on the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>If he could directly break through, undergo the three tribulation calamities, and have his vitality replenished, because the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* lags behind by a major realm, cultivating his physical body after Transcendence would undoubtedly be twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this during the Golden Core stage.  At that time, he cultivated the first two layers of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* in a very short time.</p><p>An insufficiently strong physical body might make the three calamities unstable, and there was also the worry of a possible variation in the lightning tribulation.</p><p>But Qin Sang had the Transcendence Formation of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, a spiritual formation that weakens the power of the three calamities.  With his powerful spiritual sense, and divine abilities like the South Ming Li Fire and Nine Nether Demon Fire at the Transcendence level, he should have some chance of success.</p><p>The saved time wasn’t meaningless.</p><p>Various rumors all point to one thing: the Ascendance Path to the Netherworld is not safe.</p><p>Legend says that even after Transcendence, cultivators must cultivate for a long time until they reach the peak before daring to enter the Netherworld.  Even then, many perish there.</p><p>Now that monstrous beasts are escaping their lairs and roaming everywhere, various signs indicate a change in the Netherworld.  Early Transcendence would give Qin Sang ample time to prepare for Ascendance.</p><p>Otherwise, to painstakingly cultivate to Transcendence only to die on the Ascendance path would be tragic indeed!</p><p>Mulling over these thoughts, Qin Sang hadn't made a final decision, but he had changed his cultivation plan.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang's main body continued its seclusion.</p><p>Though he resumed body cultivation, Qin Sang only occasionally used the stone platform.  He spent most of his time sensing the world, pursuing the state of oneness with nature, using spirit-feeding techniques to help the Sky Eye Butterfly, and closely monitoring the changes in the Lifeless Demon Seal.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth, Five Elements…”</p><p>Qin Sang extended his right arm, palm open, his eyes vacant, his expression somewhat bewildered.  The concept of oneness with nature sounded easy, but how to achieve it, to merge with Heaven and Earth, was something Qin Sang had never experienced before, something he could only explore gradually.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own situation and decided to start with the Five Element spiritual energy.  He possessed Five Element spiritual roots, all of which were compatible with the Five Element spiritual energy.  When cultivating, he would simultaneously draw Five Element spiritual energy into his body, making it incredibly complex. He had to spend energy sorting it, and the mixture of the Five Elements was chaotic, making it extremely difficult to refine impurities, far more difficult than with pure spiritual roots.</p><p>Following this compatibility, Qin Sang let go of his thoughts and actively merged with the Five Element spiritual energy in the world.  In the depths of his mind, his thoughts seemed to merge as well, flowing with the spiritual energy, spreading to the infinite distance, touching all things, drifting aimlessly.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang felt a warning sign and abruptly retracted his thoughts.  He then discovered that in a short time, his divine sense was almost depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He realized how much this method drained his divine sense.  His divine sense was already at the Nascent Soul level. Other cultivators of the same level, without divine sense refinement, would last even less time.</p><p>“Qi Condensation, Nascent Soul… It seems that spiritual cultivation has an advantage at this stage!  My unintentional choice to cultivate the ‘Fire Seed Golden Lotus’ was the right one…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, then calmed his mind and sat in meditation.</p><p>…</p><p>His main body remained in Luye, wholeheartedly dedicated to cultivation.  In stark contrast, his physical form was busy traveling throughout the Southern Frontier, Central Plains, Northern Wastelands, and Western Desert—everywhere except the East Sea.</p><p>Sometimes he led the Moonlit Guards, sometimes he traveled alone, and he wasn't averse to inviting help. Whether it was due to his contribution in slaying demons with his treasures, the esteem of the Hui Guang Saint and the Ganlu Monastery, or a combination of both, his physical form’s requests for aid were readily granted, even from those he had only met a few times.  A good reputation had its advantages.</p><p>It proved that a righteous reputation brought many conveniences, and Qin Sang didn't want to ruin it unless necessary.</p><p>To obtain treasures, his physical form used every means possible to explore the potential for trade. Using the identity of Daoist Qingfeng, his physical form had wide connections and was a top expert. Since Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to improve his physical form's cultivation, he didn't mind some depletion of his energy.</p><p>When the owners of treasures encountered difficulties, he always found ways to resolve them, thus winning them over.</p><p>It was rumored throughout the cultivation world that they had never seen such a readily approachable, gentle, and humble grand cultivator who frequently appeared before people.  Most parties readily agreed to trade with him.</p><p>However, they didn't know that if someone was too resolute and the treasure was something his physical form absolutely needed, he wouldn't hesitate to create difficulties for them and then step in to resolve them.</p><p>As such, his physical form's reputation in the cultivation world grew louder.  His main body, however, having disappeared for many years, and with the Three Teach Alliance causing a huge upheaval, was rarely mentioned.</p><p>…</p><p>More than twenty years later.</p><p>Luye, somehow, flew to the edge of the Northern Wastelands, staying in the northern part of Zhaoyao Prefecture for several days.</p><p>Midnight.</p><p>The night sky rippled slightly.</p><p>A fleeting shadow.</p><p>At the entrance of Luye, in front of the stele, a figure appeared—his physical form.</p><p>His physical form stopped, looking up, and saw his main body standing on the mountaintop, gazing at the mountains shrouded in night outside the secluded realm.</p><p>Their eyes met.  His main body nodded, opening the formation to let his physical form in. He had sensed beforehand that there were no abnormalities outside, no one following his physical form.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As his physical form entered, Luye immediately moved, drifting north.</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the mountaintop, perceiving through his mind the experiences of his physical form over the years.  Seeing his physical form's unstable aura, he said, "You've worked hard."</p><p>“You are me, I am you, what is there to say about hardship?”</p><p>His physical form took a wooden gourd from his waist and handed it to his main body, his tone weary.</p><p>A good reputation wasn't easily obtained.  To successfully complete transactions, his physical form had spared himself no effort, braving dangers, helping others heal, aiding others in cultivating secret techniques, several times depleting his own energy, requiring long periods of quiet cultivation to recover—sometimes over a hundred years, sometimes several decades.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul returned to the main body, nourished by secret techniques. Then Qin Sang vacated his cave dwelling for his physical form to rest.</p><p>Opening the gourd, though his physical form had sent some materials beforehand, its interior was still brimming with treasures.  The materials for the Taiji Immortal Stage and the Ice and Fire Order were complete!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.  Without hesitation, he immediately put away all the materials, carefully organizing them, and went to his specially prepared refining room to begin forging the tribulation crossing formation.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Another ten years.</p><p>(End)</p>
