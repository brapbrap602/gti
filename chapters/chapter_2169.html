<h1>Chapter 2159: Reappearance of the Radiant Glow</h1><p>That someone had beaten them to the punch was entirely unexpected.</p><p>“Did you encounter any other competitors before?” An Lingfei asked, her delicate brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>Si Huang frowned. “There should be more than one entrance to this place, but they’re far apart, leading through different paths. I vaguely sensed traces of other people’s activities inside before, but their exploration progress was far behind ours, and the location of this entrance has never been exposed.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist can't see anything unusual in the vicinity. How did Your Excellency discover this?”</p><p>Qin Sang inquired, “Was it a secret mark you left last time that was disturbed?”</p><p>“Precisely!” Si Huang's expression shifted, and he nodded slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. “Judging from this, the other party should have no inside help within the Royal Family, yet they're very familiar with this place. They definitely didn't stumble in by accident, and their strength isn't weak, otherwise they would have left subtle traces.”</p><p>By this time, the others also understood Qin Sang's meaning.</p><p>The First Prince said in a deep voice, “So, these people might be the previous competitors. Last time, they might have discovered Father's whereabouts, or perhaps deduced the location of this entrance. This time, they rushed in before us, wanting to reap the rewards!”</p><p>The Si You Royal Family had begun preparations at least two Sacred Ground Trials ago, gradually overcoming the internal difficulties and obstacles. This time, they were fully prepared and had high hopes of success, yet someone had come to steal the fruits of their labor. The First Prince and the others were indignant.</p><p>Si Huang remained silent, seemingly pondering his previous experience, his face growing increasingly gloomy.</p><p>“The ferocious beasts outside were most likely left there deliberately by them,” Shao Shi suddenly said.</p><p>Everyone was startled by his words.</p><p>Those people left the ferocious beasts alive, unafraid of the beasts disrupting them at a crucial moment, indicating they knew someone would clear them later.  As long as the other party secretly manipulated the ferocious beasts, they would know once the beasts were killed!</p><p>In this way, both sides were aware of each other's existence, and the secret struggle would escalate into open conflict!</p><p>The only advantage Si Huang and his group had was that their opponents didn't yet know they were aware of their presence.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the situation to become tense before they even truly entered. He couldn't help but frown inwardly, thinking that this trip would probably not be easy, and he didn't know whether exchanging for a Sun Bead was a gain or a loss.</p><p>The opponents knew that the Si You Royal Family had been planning this for a long time and were determined to succeed, yet they still dared to snatch the prize from the tiger's mouth. They must have been confident.</p><p>“Further speculation is useless. Let's go inside! I want to see who is so ignorant of death!”</p><p>Si Huang said coldly, stepping into the tomb passage first.</p><p>Everyone filed in. The passage was somewhat narrow, so they changed their formation. Si Huang led the way, Qin Sang and Shao Shi were on the left and right, slightly behind, and the others silently followed at the rear.</p><p>Knowing that there were opponents inside, they all used techniques to conceal their auras, advancing cautiously.</p><p>The tomb passage was long, but fortunately, it wasn't winding.</p><p>According to Si Huang, at the very beginning, the tomb passage was filled with layers of restrictions, making every step difficult. The Royal Family had paid a considerable price to overcome all the restrictions and open the passage.</p><p>The passage sloped downwards.  After a while of brisk walking, they neared the end of the passage, still without finding any traces. This showed how cautious their opponents were.</p><p>A cold gust of air blew towards them.</p><p>They reached the end of the passage. A faint light appeared ahead, which turned out to be a stone door.</p><p>The restrictions on the stone door had already been broken by the Si You Royal Family, and their opponents could open it effortlessly.</p><p>Si Huang stepped forward, touched the stone door, sensed for a moment, confirmed there was no ambush behind the door, and infused his True Essence into it. The stone door gradually became transparent, transforming into an invisible gate, its destination unknown.</p><p>Shao Shi and Qin Sang stepped forward, closely following Si Huang through the gate.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A fierce wind howled in their ears.</p><p>What they saw after passing through the gate wasn't another passage, but a void. Black mist flowed around them.  The mist flowed at a rapid pace, like a great black river, surging endlessly towards an unknown region in the depths of the void.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, still seeing the endless black mist flowing continuously, washing over them.</p><p>They were in the center of the mist river, feeling a powerful force pushing them downstream. If they didn't want to be swept away, they had to circulate their True Essence to resist the impact.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also sensed a chilling force, omnipresent and pervasive. Fortunately, he was also a body cultivator, and by mobilizing his own blood and Qi, he could resist the invasion of the chilling force.</p><p>Shao Shi wasn't as relaxed. He summoned a protective treasure, creating a layer of light around himself.</p><p>This mist looked somewhat similar to the polluted Qi of the River of Misfortune, but it wasn't as chaotic and violent.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The First Prince and the others appeared, each using their protective methods.</p><p>Suspended in the center of the mist river, Qin Sang focused his senses, surprised to find that the tomb passage they had entered seemed to have disappeared.  He couldn't sense anything.</p><p>“The entrance appears once every so often, but with only extremely subtle fluctuations, it's easy to overlook. Over the years, we've only found this one entrance.  Fortunately, the entrance doesn't move.  Remember this location. If you encounter any unexpected situations later, you can return here and leave from here,” Si Huang said.</p><p>“Will anything change near the entrance?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bound by the Tai Xu Gold Book, Si Huang couldn't lie to Qin Sang about the information regarding this place. “The entrance won't change, but this mist river will. We must go downstream, and when we return, we'll have to go upstream. As time goes on, the flow speed becomes faster and the pushing force becomes stronger.  However, being in the river, we can sense the changes in the pushing force and retreat in time.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. This was equivalent to a time limit. Once the pushing force became so strong that they couldn't resist it, they would be lost here, and no one knew what would happen next.</p><p>Now with unknown competitors, the difficulty was even greater.</p><p>“There are still no traces of those people,” Shao Shi said.</p><p>In the mist river, they couldn't see the boundaries above, below, left, or right. The black 'river water' limited their vision and perception.  Downstream, they could only see darkness, and they still didn't know who their opponents were.</p><p>Just then, everyone suddenly turned their heads and looked behind them. A red dot of light appeared in the river.</p><p>The dot of light bobbed up and down, drifting towards them.</p><p>As it approached, they discovered that a red crystal stone was encased within the red light.</p><p>“It's a Crimson Dew Crystal. Ge'er, retrieve it,” Si Huang instructed.</p><p>A hint of joy flashed in the First Prince’s eyes. He was preparing to refine a spiritual treasure and lacked a few spiritual materials, one of which was the Crimson Dew Crystal. He hadn't expected to encounter it here.</p><p>His brow flickered, and he immediately summoned a companion beast.</p><p>The beast resembled a fox, but was the size of a rat, its tail several times the length of its body. The companion beast turned its body, and with a gentle flick of its long tail, it shot towards the red light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The long tail pierced through the red light, easily reaching the Crimson Dew Crystal.  But as the tail wrapped around the crystal and pulled, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The red light suddenly erupted. The First Prince sensed an incredibly sharp fluctuation within the red light, and his heart chilled.</p><p>If hit by this force, his companion beast would be decapitated!</p><p>Seeing this, including Si Huang, no one intervened, believing that the First Prince could handle it.</p><p>The First Prince growled. A treasure bell appeared above the red light and descended heavily, causing the red light to momentarily stagnate.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, the companion beast's tail tightened, forcefully pulling the Crimson Dew Crystal out of the red light and holding it tightly. Then, like a wisp of smoke, it escaped back to the First Prince's side.  With the Crimson Dew Crystal taken, the red light gave up the chase, flickered a few times, and gradually dissipated.</p><p>Only then did Si Huang explain, “While traveling here, you'll occasionally see similar orbs of light, in different colors. Some contain treasures, some may be small secret realms, but there are also traps. In my experience, black and white orbs are mostly traps, best avoided.  Other colors can be tried. However, with enemies present, I hope you can resist the temptation until our objective is achieved.”</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>Chao Keqing, who had been staring upstream of the mist river, said softly, "So many treasures scattered here, like fragments.  Could the upstream be a shattered secret realm or cave abode?”</p><p>“Perhaps. We've tried before, but we couldn't reach upstream before the pushing force of the mist river exceeded our limit.”</p><p>Si Huang shook his head, then withdrew his True Essence, allowing the mist current to push him downstream.  With the help of the mist river's own pushing force, they moved quickly without much effort.</p><p>Before long, they encountered a second orb of light, which was black.</p><p>Remembering Si Huang's words, they deliberately kept a distance from the orb, fearing they would fall into a trap.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, but could only see a mass of blackness.  He also faintly felt a sense of being watched, which made him uncomfortable.  He retracted his gaze, and that feeling disappeared.</p><p>With this experience, Qin Sang didn't dare to underestimate these orbs of light. Not every one was as easy to obtain as the Crimson Dew Crystal.</p><p>Next, they encountered more orbs of light, but they didn't make a move on any of them.</p><p>After a stick of incense, Si Huang, who had been drifting along the mist river, paused slightly and warned, “The first ancient formation is ahead.”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately felt a change in the pushing force, his body suddenly sinking as if the mist river had become a waterfall.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>They plummeted downwards, circulating their True Essence to stabilize themselves.  Ahead, they saw countless black stones floating.</p><p>These stones were all the same size and shape, the only difference being the patterns on their surfaces, which were clearly a type of special rune.</p><p>The stones were arranged in a staggered formation, forming a spirit array.</p><p>Seeing the stone formation, Si Huang's face darkened.  He saw that several stones directly in front of them were covered in cracks, severely damaged. This stone formation had already been thoroughly explored by the Royal Family.  Before they left last time, they had altered the formation of the stone formation, blocking the entrance.</p><p>The stone formation had clearly been destroyed by those ahead of them. The other party could have used a gentler method, but they had clearly known there were pursuers behind them and were no longer hiding.</p><p>Si Huang snorted coldly and waved his hand. The nearby stones began to move, and a mysterious profound light flowed between them.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Loose stones flew through the air.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the stone formation changed drastically, and a passage appeared before them. The power of the stone formation couldn't stop the mist river either, and as they traveled through the formation, they were still subjected to the scouring of the mist river.</p><p>They quickly passed through the stone formation, and another ancient formation blocked their path.</p><p>To the naked eye, only a blinding light screen was visible, but within the light screen lay another world.</p><p>This formation had also been broken by the Si You Royal Family.  Unlike the stone formation, it wasn't easy to manipulate, and the previously opened gap remained, allowing their opponents to pass through this formation effortlessly.</p><p>The previous efforts of the Si You Royal Family had paved the way for others.</p><p>The First Prince and the others were furious, vowing to make those people pay the price once they were found.</p><p>Passing through the gap, they arrived at the third ancient formation, where the Si You Royal Family's arrangements had also been destroyed.</p><p>Just as they were about to enter the third ancient formation, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>He paused, noticing that both Si Huang and Shao Shi's expressions had changed.</p><p>He vaguely perceived an unusual fluctuation coming from the depths of the mist river, and a sense of unease rose in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, everyone had a similar feeling. It wasn't an illusion.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>A tremor suddenly transmitted, like a muffled thunderclap.</p><p>Caught between two ancient formations, they saw the power of both formations begin to fluctuate.</p><p>The First Prince's face changed slightly. "Could they have already started breaking the formation?"</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A greater tremor came from ahead.</p><p>Thunderous sounds reverberated around them. To their astonishment, several cracks appeared in the ancient formation in front of them.</p><p>Through the cracks, they could vaguely see the scene in the depths of the mist river.</p><p>Shao Shi's expression suddenly changed. Pointing to one of the cracks, he exclaimed, “Fellow Cultivator Qin, look there!”</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed it. A brilliant radiant glow had emerged in the depths of the mist river.</p><p>He had a bad premonition. “This radiant glow, could it be…”</p><p>Shao Shi nodded gravely.  Although it was only a fleeting glimpse, the radiant glow here was almost identical to the one Ji Qiong had described.</p><p>How could a radiant glow erupt here?</p><p>Could there be another Great Calamity lair ahead?</p><p>Qin Sang quietly retreated behind the group. If not for the constraints of the Tai Xu Gold Book and the absence of the Great Calamity's aura, he would have already used his Thunder Escape technique and fled far away.</p><p>“There are absolutely no Saint Realm ferocious beasts here!”</p><p>Si Huang declared resolutely. The Si You Royal Family would definitely not court their own destruction.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the mist river shook violently.  Everyone watched as the ancient formation in front of them tore apart, finally unable to bear the strain, a giant fissure splitting through the entire formation.</p><p>The fissure revealed the scene within the depths of the mist river.  Resplendent, dazzling radiant glow gushed forth unrestrainedly.  Yet, the beautiful glow carried a powerful force that was difficult to resist, making everyone wary.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The mist river churned.</p><p>The mist surged like a tide, carrying streaks of radiant glow, crashing towards them. This force was even stronger than the mist river's own pushing force.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Si Huang commanded, and everyone retreated.  Caught between the oncoming impact and the pushing force from behind, they were in a difficult position.  Fortunately, they were all cultivators with profound cultivation, and they remained calm in the face of danger. While retreating, they kept their eyes fixed on the radiant glow, and indeed, they made a new discovery.</p><p>At the edge of the radiant glow, several black dots appeared, retreating outwards just like them, their figures quite disheveled. They were clearly the opponents who had arrived first.</p><p>Si Huang's eyes narrowed slightly, fixated on those figures, his voice icy, “They’re the Feathered Race!”</p><p>Everyone saw that those people had a pair of wings on their backs, flapping frantically to resist the impact of the radiant glow.</p>
