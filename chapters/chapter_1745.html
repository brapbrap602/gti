<h1>Chapter 1736: Old Foes</h1><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>The island was teeming with distinguished guests, leaving Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming overwhelmed.</p><p>While Qin Sang was discussing cultivation techniques with Elder Yang, a servant girl announced Bao Xi's arrival.</p><p>Elder Yang tactfully excused himself.</p><p>Bao Xi bowed and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, there's news about the people you were looking for. However..."</p><p>Her voice trailed off, a hesitant look on her face.</p><p>Seeing her expression, Qin Sang had a premonition.  He said in a deep voice, "The Heavenly Dao is constant, and everyone has their own destiny. Fellow Daoist, please speak freely."</p><p>Bao Xi nodded. "Protector Chen personally went to Lingchun Island but couldn't find the sect that the two Fellow Daoists Wang belonged to. Inquiries in the vicinity revealed that during the demonic chaos, a Demon King broke through the defensive line, and Lingchun Island happened to be in the path of the demonic invasion. The cultivators on the island were forced to flee. The sect of the two Fellow Daoists Wang also suffered this fate. Fortunately, they both escaped, but they sustained varying degrees of injuries and were unable to break through to the Nascent Soul realm. They have since passed away."</p><p>Before learning this outcome, Qin Sang had already anticipated that the Wang sisters likely wouldn't survive this tribulation.</p><p>Confirming their demise, he couldn't help but lament the cruelty of time.</p><p>"Where is their sect now?"</p><p>"After fleeing Lingchun Island, they led the surviving disciples to an island in the West Sea and re-established their sect. But their foundation was destroyed, and their talents dwindled.  The following years were quite difficult. The two Fellow Daoists Wang dedicated themselves to the sect, and after years of recuperation, they managed to gradually restore some vitality..."</p><p>Bao Xi briefly described the current state of the Wang sisters' sect.</p><p>The demonic chaos had a profound impact, and the situation of the cultivators in the Canglang Sea was far worse than before.</p><p>The casualties caused by the war were only part of the problem.</p><p>The demonic races of the Demon Sea could now threaten the heartland of the Canglang Sea, reversing the situation where they could only passively endure attacks.  They no longer had as many scruples.</p><p>Although the teleportation formation leading to the Demon Sea was still under the control of cultivators, the Demon Sea was far more dangerous than before. Only a few powerful individuals dared to hunt demons there.</p><p>Cultivation resources had sharply declined.</p><p>The strong grew stronger, and the weak grew weaker.</p><p>"The current Sect Master is a disciple of Fellow Daoist Wang Xiang. Protector Chen has already invited her to Tianxing Island. Do you want her to come and pay her respects?" Bao Xi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "There's no need. I'll trouble your esteemed palace to look after them in the future."</p><p>Bao Xi didn't ask further questions and readily agreed.  Protecting a small sect was a trivial matter for the Four Saints Palace. She continued, "The palace sent people to the Splitting Wind Archipelago, but they didn't find any female cultivators matching Bai Yinger's description, nor did anyone see the two-headed serpent you described on the battlefield. However, during their inquiries, they learned that a hundred years ago, a fellow Daoist encountered a three-headed serpent while hunting demons in the Demon Sea. It seemed to be a Demon King in the Transformation realm.  According to that person, the three-headed serpent had no intention of killing and simply glanced at him before leaving.  That person was petrified on the spot. From afar, he saw a female cultivator beside the three-headed serpent, but he couldn't be certain if she was a human cultivator."</p><p>"A three-headed serpent?"</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that the two-headed serpent had two heads when he met it, but the other bulge was already quite noticeable.  It was indeed possible for it to grow another head after breaking through to the Transformation realm.</p><p>"What kind of bloodline does this creature have, growing another head with each realm breakthrough?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>It was a pity that the witness was too frightened to move and couldn't clearly see the appearance of the female cultivator beside the three-headed serpent.</p><p>If it truly was the two-headed serpent, with its arrogant nature, it was impossible for it to willingly become someone else's spirit beast.  If there was a woman beside it, could it be a human pet it had taken?</p><p>It sounded like the creature was living quite comfortably.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang said that if they could find it, so be it. If not, there was no need to force it.  Knowing the news of his old acquaintance was enough, and there was no need to disturb them.</p><p>Bao Xi acknowledged his words and then mentioned another great demon, "It's almost certain that the Nine Phoenix King you're looking for is the current Nine Phoenix King of the Phoenix Clan in the Demon Sea. She has always been a great enemy of our human race. This demon holds a high position in the demon army. Although she's only at the peak of the mid-Transformation realm, her magical powers and abilities are remarkable. Even Elder Zhuo isn't confident in capturing her.  The number of Nascent Soul fellow Daoists who have died at her hands is not small."</p><p>Listening to Bao Xi recount the numerous killings committed by the Nine Phoenix King, Qin Sang wasn't surprised. The Nine Phoenix King should have been the first Demon King to infiltrate the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Her courage and methods were first-rate.</p><p>The intelligence gathered by the Nine Phoenix King during her infiltration of the Canglang Sea had also been of great help to the demonic invasion.</p><p>"Where is she now?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's expression and tone hadn't changed, Bao Xi keenly sensed a different aura from when he mentioned the three-headed serpent.  This one seemed to carry a hint of killing intent.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King had always been a thorn in the side of the Four Saints Palace. Bao Xi was secretly delighted. "A Phoenix Clan army is currently stationed on a demon island two thousand miles north of Great Desolation Island.  Ten years ago, they changed commanders. The new commander is reclusive and quite mysterious. Based on the information gathered by our spies, we suspect it might be the Nine Phoenix King."</p><p>In the last great war, the demon race failed to capture Great Desolation Island, but they left several armies stationed within ten thousand miles of Great Desolation Island, keeping a close watch on the human race.</p><p>Since then, the three races had been quiet for a long time.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace knew very well that the demon race was gathering strength and would launch the next war at any time, but they didn't have a good solution. The human and witch races also needed to recuperate.</p><p>Now, there was a feeling of an impending storm, and Bao Zhengnan was having a headache. Qin Sang's arrival was timely.</p><p>"Whether it is or not, one look will tell."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, taking the sea chart handed over by Bao Xi and memorizing the location of the demon island.</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The grand gathering was held as scheduled.</p><p>The various sects and factions initially thought a great war was imminent and were on high alert.  Until Qin Sang appeared, the entire venue was stunned.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang would mediate the dispute between the two realms, some were dissatisfied, feeling that Qin Sang, despite being of human origin, wasn't acting in the best interests of the human race.  They grumbled in private but didn't dare to speak ill of him in his presence.</p><p>Most people felt a sense of relief.</p><p>They had witnessed countless tragedies during the years of constant warfare and were physically and mentally exhausted.</p><p>What was the true purpose of cultivation?</p><p>During those dark days, many people had asked themselves this question. If they could attain immortality without conflict, it would surely be the dream of most cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, the human heart was unpredictable, and the conflicts between the three races deepened over time.</p><p>The root of the hatred was the endless demon hunting by the human and witch races, but they could also justify their actions with the Great Dao and wouldn't give up on spirit medicines like Demon Slaying Pills.</p><p>Cultivation was inseparable from conflict.</p><p>At first, the demon race harbored deep resentment, and now the demon race had committed numerous atrocities in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The grudges and grievances were tangled like a messy knot, impossible to unravel.</p><p>It was rare for an expert like Qin Sang to appear, detached and willing to mediate. He immediately gained the support of the majority.</p><p>Especially after Qin Sang announced the existence of the Ascension Platform, the crowd erupted in excitement. These usually composed Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't sit still, eagerly asking if it was true.</p><p>Those with lingering resentment also put aside their grudges.</p><p>The reason for the endless fighting was because they couldn't see a way out.  They could only focus on immediate benefits, scheming for their future, inevitably becoming overly concerned with minor details.</p><p>Everyone present was a powerful figure, but how many dared to dream of reaching the Deity Transformation realm?</p><p>The Ascension Platform, accessible to Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators, undoubtedly brought them hope, at least easier than Deity Transformation.</p><p>Under the leadership of Qin Sang and the Four Saints Palace, the human race formed an alliance, making the search for the Ascension Platform their top priority. However, whether or not the war could be stopped wasn't up to the human race alone.</p><p>Qin Sang declared that he would soon travel to the Demon Sea to visit the major demon tribes.</p><p>After the alliance was formed, Qin Sang went into seclusion.</p><p>Many people wanted to visit him, but they were all stopped by the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>For the following period, Elder Yang fully cooperated with Qin Sang in comprehending the Yin Yang Heavenly Strife Secret Art, perfecting the technique. Even for parts that couldn't be changed, Qin Sang could offer suggestions, using other secret arts or pills to mitigate hidden dangers.</p><p>Deducing cultivation techniques was extremely mentally taxing, even more tiring than actual cultivation!</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang completely reorganized the Yin Yang Heavenly Strife Secret Art.  Future bottlenecks for those cultivating the Yin and Yang lineage would be greatly reduced, and he himself benefited immensely.</p><p>...</p><p>One day.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in his cave, holding the white Go piece between his fingers, examining it repeatedly.</p><p>Perfecting the technique was also a gradual process of exploring the secrets of the white Go piece, but with Qin Sang's cultivation level, he couldn't find any clues in a short time.</p><p>Thinking about the things he had to do next:</p><p>Body refinement, repairing the Taiyi Star Carriage, comprehending the sword formation, were all more important than the white Go piece.</p><p>Right, and the spirit fire!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.  He curled his fingers, put away the white Go piece, pondered for a moment, then got up and walked out of the cave, heading straight for the teleportation formation. When he teleported to Great Desolation Island, Bao Zhengnan was already waiting there with his men.</p><p>"Is True Monarch Qin going to the demon territory today?"</p><p>In front of others, Bao Zhengnan was impeccably polite.</p><p>Walking to the highest point of Great Desolation Island, Qin Sang glanced around. The island was bustling with people, and the troops were in formation.</p><p>The human race wanted to cease fighting, but the demon race might not agree. Bao Zhengnan was gathering his troops, seeing Qin Sang off.</p><p>Such a large movement was impossible to hide. News of the human activity on Great Desolation Island spread like wildfire to the demon race.</p><p>Luo Ying Island.</p><p>This island, located two thousand miles north of Great Desolation Island, had been under the rule of the Phoenix Clan for thousands of years.  There was a type of spiritual tree called Luo Ying on the island that bore crimson fruits, a favorite food of the Phoenix Clan.</p><p>After the human race established a teleportation formation on Great Desolation Island, Luo Ying Island, due to its proximity, was quickly captured by human cultivators, and the Phoenix descendants on the island were all expelled.</p><p>Luo Ying Crimson Fruits were not beneficial to humans but rather harmful.</p><p>However, the Luo Ying tree was a rare type of spiritual wood and was soon cut down by the human race.  Later, other cultivators, seeing the abundant spiritual energy on the island, established cave dwellings there, completely occupying it.</p><p>Over thousands of years, the demon race had organized countless counterattacks and even recaptured Luo Ying Island, but because they couldn't conquer Great Desolation Island, these efforts were ultimately in vain.</p><p>It wasn't until hundreds of years ago, after the human race learned a painful lesson, that they dared not act so recklessly. Luo Ying Island returned to the Phoenix Clan's control, but sadly, the Luo Ying spiritual trees were gone.</p><p>The Phoenix Clan stationed an army on this island to monitor the human race.  Any unusual activity on Great Desolation Island would be immediately detected here.</p><p>The Phoenix was the king of spiritual birds.</p><p>Most of the tribes affiliated with the Phoenix Clan were demon bird tribes.</p><p>Now, Luo Ying Island was covered with towering trees, and among the dense branches and leaves, one could see countless nests and cave dwellings, all carved into the treetops.</p><p>Demon birds constantly patrolled the skies above.</p><p>The leaders among the demon birds were easily distinguishable. Most had brightly colored feathers or bore characteristics of the legendary divine bird, the Phoenix, mostly direct descendants of the Phoenix Clan.</p><p>However, even descendants of the Heavenly Phoenix like the Nine Phoenix King appeared somewhat grotesque due to their diluted Phoenix bloodline.  But the unique aspect of the demon race was their ability to continuously purify their bloodline during cultivation, gradually transforming.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Demon birds constantly took to the sky on Luo Ying Island, flock after flock led by their leaders, flying in different directions.</p><p>Inside an ornate treehouse on the island.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King, in her human form, was as beautiful as she was years ago, but her eyes were sharper, clearly hardened by battle.</p><p>She held a golden short horn in her hand, shaped like a dragon's horn and covered in blood streaks.</p><p>The short horn glowed faintly, and the blood streaks detached one by one, piercing the Nine Phoenix King's smooth, flawless skin.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King felt no pain and closed her eyes slightly.  Immediately, she sensed a questioning voice from the short horn.</p><p>"Why are the humans assembling their army at this time? Who leaked the secret?"</p><p>"Does it matter who leaked it?" another voice rang out.  "The humans are timid as mice.  With the slightest disturbance, any action from them isn't surprising. Jiao Wang never thought we could truly conceal our movements from their eyes.  In any case, we've been preparing for so long, and we must proceed!"</p><p>"Don't you find it strange that our army hasn't even set off yet, and the human reaction is so intense?" the first voice questioned.</p><p>"Does the Wind-Tearing King think the humans dare to launch a counteroffensive?" a third voice interjected.</p><p>"I suspect the humans have other motives!"</p><p>"I share that suspicion," the Nine Phoenix King suddenly spoke.  "I've ordered my subordinates to scatter and monitor the humans' movements. You should also be cautious in other directions, don't be deceived by appearances."</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King held a high position among these Demon Kings.  As soon as she spoke, she elicited a chorus of agreement.  Another Demon King reminded, "Nine Phoenix King, you should also be careful. If the humans know you are here, they will definitely send experts to launch a sneak attack."</p><p>…</p><p>After briefly communicating with the other Demon Kings stationed near Great Desolation Island, the Nine Phoenix King put away the short horn and rubbed her temples. She wasn't worried about her own safety. The island had been prepared in advance, and with her innate magical power, even if all the human Grand Cultivators came, she could escape at any time.</p><p>The human race was gathering its army at this time. What was their intention?</p><p>Lost in thought, the Nine Phoenix King pushed open the wooden door, intending to send out more of her remaining forces. Suddenly, she felt the giant tree beneath her tremble violently, and a thunderclap boomed in the clear sky!</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King was startled and looked up in alarm. She saw a lightning-fast sword light slashing down from the sky, striking the grand formation.</p><p>The Phoenix Clan's heritage was different from the human race's.  They were adept at stimulating the blood qi of their tribe, condensing demon formations, whose power was no weaker than human spirit formations.  But under this single sword strike, the entire Luo Ying Island trembled.</p><p>*Bang, bang, bang...*</p><p>Demon birds rained down from the treetops, feathers flying everywhere.  They were all knocked unconscious by the shockwave, and those with weaker physical bodies were instantly killed!</p><p>Beneath the sword light, a crimson light barrier shimmered in mid-air, now covered in cracks.</p><p>But even now, she hadn't seen the enemy!</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King turned and was about to rush back into the treehouse when her vision blurred, and a figure appeared out of thin air in front of her.</p><p>Her jade hand transformed into a blade, flowing with seven colors, instinctively about to strike. At the same time, her other hand forced out essence blood from her palm. Before she could unleash her magical power, she suddenly felt an insurmountable pressure descend upon her, freezing her in place, her face filled with terror.</p><p>Before she could recover, the surrounding scenery drastically changed.</p><p>The ancient trees vanished, replaced by a starry sky.  The Nine Phoenix King could sense that her connection to the outside world was completely severed by the starry sky. All the clan's arrangements on the island were nullified!</p><p>"Where are you going, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed directly in front of the Nine Phoenix King.</p><p>At first, the Nine Phoenix King didn't recognize Qin Sang, only feeling that he looked familiar. But the experience at the Seven Kills Hall left too deep an impression on her.  She finally remembered Qin Sang and exclaimed in shock, "It's you?"</p><p></p>
