<h1>Chapter 2101: Bound Hand and Foot</h1><p>North Sea.</p><p>In the jungle of a desolate island, a small fox poked its head out cautiously, its eyes filled with vigilance.</p><p>The sea was calm and peaceful, the sea breeze gentle, the waves lapping softly against the shore.</p><p>A moment later, the little fox retreated, hopping and weaving nimbly through the jungle, finally arriving before a towering ancient tree. It crashed headfirst into the trunk.</p><p>Strangely, the ancient tree remained motionless, and the little fox's figure vanished into thin air.</p><p>It turned out that there was a tree hollow at the base of the ancient tree, concealed by a restrictive formation. The little fox appeared inside the hollow. The interior was dry and refreshing, with two meditation mats placed side by side. Qin Li was sitting on one of them, meditating with his eyes closed.</p><p>His face was slightly pale, his lips chapped, clearly injured, but his breathing had stabilized.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox had been hiding here for several days.</p><p>After the second line of defense was breached, they retreated with the main force.  They experienced several more defeats, but the higher-ups were methodical, always retreating in time before the situation deteriorated, letting low-level disciples like them escape first while the experts stayed behind to cover their retreat, deflecting the enemy's edge and maintaining order in their withdrawal.</p><p>Although this approach dampened morale, it prevented significant casualties.</p><p>However, accidents were inevitable. Qin Li's squad was targeted by a Changyou Clan army during one retreat.  After a fierce battle, he and the little fox were separated from the others, and Qin Li was unfortunately injured.</p><p>By the time they shook off their pursuers, they had completely lost track of everyone else, leaving only the man and the fox adrift at sea.</p><p>Unsure whether their side had repelled the enemy or been routed and pursued, they dared not follow the established route to rendezvous with others.</p><p>Moreover, with the Changyou Clan invasion, the entire sea region was in turmoil. The strongholds they remembered might have already been occupied by the enemy, leaving no place truly safe.</p><p>Without intelligence, they were lost, unsure where to go. Qin Li's injuries worsened their plight, but they dared not stop to heal.</p><p>Finally, the little fox decided not to seek the main army, but to head to the North Star Realm. First, the North Star Realm was the ancestral home of the Green Ram Sect. Second, they had been retreating towards the Crescent Moon Realm, constantly suffering from pursuit and interception, suggesting that the enemy's main target was likely the Crescent Moon Realm, as it housed the most important ancient translocation formation.</p><p>The little fox led Qin Li northeast, cautiously making their way to the North Star Realm.  As expected, their journey was relatively uneventful, proving their choice correct.</p><p>A few days ago, Qin Li's injuries suddenly worsened, beyond the control of medicinal pills. They were forced to take the risk of stopping to allow him to heal.</p><p>Fortunately, after a period of recuperation, Qin Li's condition gradually improved.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes, licked his chapped lips, and saw the little fox squatting before him, staring intently.</p><p>"How do you feel?" the little fox asked.</p><p>"Much better," Qin Li paused, his face apologetic. "I've been a burden to you."</p><p>Qin Li understood that this place was not safe, and the little fox was taking a great risk by staying with him.</p><p>The little fox snorted, stretching languidly. "We can't stay here long.  It's time to leave. I just went out to scout. The surroundings are safe."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Li took out a jade bottle, stuffed all the pills inside into his mouth without time to refine them, cleaned up their traces, and left the tree hollow with the little fox.  They activated a concealing artifact and continued towards the North Star Realm.</p><p>They were extremely cautious.  The clever little fox, even at sea, could keenly detect traces and judge potential dangers, repeatedly helping them evade the enemy.</p><p>Qin Li focused on controlling the artifact, the little fox on vigilance, and they safely passed another two days.</p><p>As they drew closer to the North Star Realm, crisis struck unexpectedly!</p><p>It was evening. There was no storm, yet the sky was covered by thick clouds, the setting sun's rays barely penetrating. Clouds drifted and shifted in the heavens.</p><p>A cloud mass moved through the cloud layer, inconspicuous, even escaping the vigilant little fox's notice.</p><p>Above the cloud mass, sitting or standing, were Changyou Clan experts.</p><p>Following the Clan Leader's will, General Minshan had shifted the target from the Crescent Moon Realm to the North Star Realm, using a feigned attack to deceive the Storm Realm forces. The main force had already approached the North Star Realm.</p><p>With the plan successful, the Changyou Clan experts responsible for the diversion immediately came to assist, and they discovered the little fox and Qin Li while passing through this area.</p><p>Seeing two juniors with low cultivation, the experts above the cloud mass didn't even bother to glance at them. One of them tilted a jade cup in his hand, casually spilling a few drops of wine.</p><p>The wine droplets instantly transformed into a torrential downpour.  Qin Li and the little fox finally sensed the danger, but it was too late.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The rain poured down, the aroma of wine permeating the air.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made the little fox and Qin Li tremble, unable to muster the slightest resistance.  Their faces were filled with despair. They had been so careful along the way, yet they still couldn't escape this calamity.</p><p>Just as they were about to be swallowed by the downpour, a bright ray of light pierced through the clouds, descending from the heavens.</p><p>The Changyou Clan experts above the cloud mass changed color. The one holding the jade cup abruptly stood, flipping the cup upside down and throwing it downwards.</p><p>The cup's mouth rapidly expanded, erupting with a powerful suction force, attempting to draw the little fox and Qin Li inside. However, the ray of light was faster, appearing above their heads in an instant, revealing a spectral sword image.</p><p>Wherever the sword image passed, raindrops dissolved, the downpour ceasing. Then, the tip of the sword flicked upwards, and a burst of sword energy suddenly slashed towards the jade cup.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A crisp sound rang out, and a crack appeared on the jade cup.  With a series of clinking sounds, the cup shattered into several pieces, falling into the sea.</p><p>The little fox and Qin Li clung to each other, thinking they were about to die, but the situation took an unexpected turn.</p><p>They stared blankly at the spiritual sword before them, finding it somewhat familiar, but its power didn't match their memories.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Having shattered the jade cup, the spiritual sword immediately slashed towards the cloud mass in the sky.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The clouds churned, and several powerful auras erupted. The hope that had just ignited in the little fox's eyes was extinguished again.</p><p>These auras were even more terrifying than those of Golden Core Realm experts.  They were all Changyou Clan experts of the Nascent Soul Realm, Fourth Stage, their strength comparable to Nascent Soul Patriarchs.</p><p>Any one of them could crush them with a single hair!</p><p>However, the spiritual sword pressed forward relentlessly, like a rainbow piercing the sun, striking the cloud mass head-on. The figures above scattered, none daring to block the sword, choosing instead to evade its edge.</p><p>Seeing this, the little fox was stunned, then its eyes suddenly brightened as a familiar figure appeared: Jian Yi, whom they had lost track of.</p><p>Jian Yi could force back several Nascent Soul experts with a single sword strike.  Was this still the same person they knew?</p><p>The ecstasy of reuniting with an old friend and the shock of that sword strike deeply impacted the little fox and Qin Li.</p><p>Qin Li was still dazed when the quick-witted little fox prostrated itself, crying out, "Senior Jian, save me!"</p><p>Jian Yi nodded at them, his tone as always, "Go first."</p><p>The little fox tugged at Qin Li's clothes and retreated silently.  They saw Jian Yi merge with his sword, soaring into the sky, unafraid to face multiple opponents alone.</p><p>Even after flying a considerable distance, they could still feel the astonishing fluctuations from behind and the enraged cries of the Changyou Clan experts.</p><p>The little fox was secretly alarmed, whispering, "I fear there are experts among the enemy comparable to late-Nascent Soul Patriarchs."</p><p>They had witnessed the formidable power of late-Nascent Soul Patriarchs on the battlefield.</p><p>"Jian..."</p><p>Qin Li almost called out "Brother Jian," but quickly corrected himself, "Will Senior Jian be in danger?"</p><p>"Don't worry, Senior Jian is clearly a hidden expert roaming the mortal world, and we've encountered him!  It's a good thing we never bullied him for his low cultivation before..."</p><p>The little fox looked apprehensive, then curious.  "What do you think Senior Jian's true identity is? What powerful sword cultivators are there in the North Sea?"</p><p>"Sword Dao?"</p><p>A figure immediately sprang to Qin Li's mind, and he exchanged a glance with the little fox. Clearly, it had thought of the same person.</p><p>"If it's him, we've struck it rich!  This Immortal Fox is friends with the Sect Master of the Green Ram Sect. See who dares bully me now!"</p><p>The little fox's eyes gleamed with excitement, its bushy tail wagging back and forth.</p><p>As they were envisioning their future, several booms resonated from behind, followed by an unsettling silence.</p><p>Finally, Jian Yi flew back alone, unharmed.  The enemy's fate was easy to imagine.  The sword light swept up the man and the fox, flying north at high speed.</p><p>By now, the Changyou Clan's invasion of the North Star Realm had begun.</p><p>Shortly after the battle commenced, Minshan and the Clan Elders sensed something amiss.  The North Star Realm's counterattack was fiercer than anticipated, especially the number of Nascent Soul experts, which far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>According to their plan, the Crescent Moon Realm was already under siege, and the reinforcements from the Central Continent would have to stay put to prevent any mishaps with the ancient translocation formation. Even if they suspected something, they wouldn't dare send everyone to the North Star Realm.</p><p>However, reality deviated from their predictions. The Storm Realm seemed to have accurately judged their movements. With the appearance of Li Yufu, Tong Lingyu, Bao Zhengnan, and others, their suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>Minshan was shocked and furious, unsure where the leak had occurred.  All signs indicated that the various factions of the Central Continent had their own agendas, and reinforcements had yet to arrive.  How could the North Sea and its allies dare to make such a gamble with just their own strength?</p><p>At this point, retreat was impossible; they could only continue fighting.</p><p>West of the North Star Realm, the two armies quickly clashed.  The sky was overcast, and strange lights frequently erupted from the sea surface, accompanied by deafening war cries.</p><p>Min Zhuo knew the inside story.  The Changyou Clan hadn't mobilized all their forces, but it would still be extremely difficult for the sects of the North Sea to stop the Changyou Clan army.</p><p>...</p><p>"Senior Jian Nu!"</p><p>Huan Hen returned, having regained his original appearance. His aura was still incomparably sharp, but he had undergone a profound transformation.</p><p>Jian Nu showed appreciation, rising on his sword. "Follow me to battle!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Two sword lights, one after the other, rushed towards the heart of the battlefield. Most of the Storm Realm's Nascent Soul cultivators and the Changyou Clan's Void Stage First Level experts were here, engaged in a fierce struggle.</p><p>This was a battlefield for the strong.  Others had retreated far away, leaving a vast expanse of empty sea.</p><p>Li Yufu knew that in one-on-one combat, their side would be at a disadvantage.  He stayed close to Tong Lingyu and the others, supporting each other and barely holding on under the enemy's siege.</p><p>His eyes flickered, occasionally sweeping across the battlefield, seemingly waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Suddenly, sword light pierced through the air, the incredibly sharp sword intent attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>Sensing the newcomer's aura, Minshan and the others were shocked. When did another late-Nascent Soul expert appear in the Storm Realm?</p><p>Jian Nu didn't speak, his sword intent locking onto a Changyou Clan Elder, pressing forward relentlessly!</p><p>At the same time, Li Yufu's eyes flashed, and he roared, "Activate the formation!"</p><p>His voice boomed across the battlefield. Spiritual banners were erected across the battlefield. These were formation banners specially refined by Qin Sang, modeled after the Heavenly River Reverse Slaughter Formation. Their power was undeniable.</p><p>The core disciples of the Green Ram Sect and the Profound Sky Palace held the formation banners, scattered across the battlefield.  Upon receiving their Sect Master's command, they raised the banners. Other cultivators simply followed orders, assisting them in controlling the banners, and the grand formation was completed in an instant.</p><p>The battlefield, stretching for thousands of miles, was immediately enveloped in darkness, like a gigantic black dragon. Then, points of light, like starlight, appeared on the dragon's body.</p><p>At this moment, even from the North Star Realm, one could see the west plunged into eternal night, with stars rising from the horizon.</p><p>In the next moment, the stars trembled, emitting brilliant starlight. A meteor fell into the sea, followed by countless meteors forming a meteor shower, descending from the sky.</p><p>The people in the North Star Realm witnessed a tragically beautiful meteor shower, while the Changyou Clan on the battlefield experienced a nightmare.</p><p>At the heart of the battlefield, Minshan and the others were thrown into chaos. The formation's power disrupted their ranks, and they also had to face the terrifying Jian Nu. Within a few breaths, two Clan Elders perished, pierced through by Jian Nu's sword.</p><p>Huan Hen, following behind Jian Nu, also slew a Changyou Clan expert, his eyes growing brighter. This experience had been worthwhile. He had finally witnessed a more wondrous sight, and he felt his bottleneck loosening.</p><p>Then, he heard a sigh from Jian Nu.</p><p>Jian Nu was also pursuing a higher realm, but these enemies were too weak to hone his sword intent.</p><p>No one on the battlefield noticed that high above, two figures were locked in a standoff.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, if you don't act, the Changyou Clan will be routed," Su Nü kindly reminded the other party.</p><p>The figure opposite her wore a bamboo hat, obscuring their face. They said indifferently, "I am only responsible for stopping experts of the same level. Their lack of strength is their own fault.  Even if their entire army is annihilated, I am not to blame."</p><p>Su Nü's eyes flickered. "So, Fellow Daoist is not an ally of the Changyou Clan.  Then why are you intervening on their behalf?"</p><p>Seeing the other party remain silent, Su Nü's beautiful eyes darted around, and she suddenly smiled. "Found you! Fellow Daoist surely wouldn't obstruct me for these people, would you?"</p><p>As she spoke, she flicked her fingers, and several strands of subtle energy drifted towards the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>There, several people were observing the battle. One of them, surnamed Hong, was the demonic cultivator who had secretly pledged allegiance to the Dragon King. It was he who, under the Dragon King's instructions, had colluded with the Changyou Clan.</p><p>Upon receiving the news, the demonic cultivator surnamed Hong personally led his men here. The outcome of this battle determined whether they could obtain the Azure Spirit Qi from the Changyou Clan.</p><p>Watching the starlight continuously bombard the Changyou Clan army, their expressions were grave. One of them said anxiously, "How can the Changyou Clan be so useless!"</p><p>"It's the formation's power! It's too strong!"</p><p>The demonic cultivator surnamed Hong slowly shook his head, sensing something was wrong.  Where did the North Sea obtain these formation banners?</p><p>Preoccupied with the battle, none of them noticed the chain-like black patterns that quietly appeared on their ankles, spreading up their legs and across their bodies.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>By the time they realized the danger, they were already bound hand and foot.</p>
