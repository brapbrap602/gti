<h1>Chapter 879: Familiar Scenery</h1><p>Falling from the Cloud Bridge, the avatar felt a sudden lightness as a flying sword guided him down, escaping the illusion.</p><p>Most of the others had fallen before him.  They were now divided into two groups on either side of the dock, some meditating, others standing, their expressions varied.</p><p>The left group was much smaller, only about a dozen people, all looking spirited.  This included the young man who had fallen first; his earlier dejection replaced by a joyful expression.</p><p>The other side, though larger, was filled with gloom.</p><p>Seeing this, the avatar immediately understood that those on the left had been chosen by the Yanmiao Pavilion.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the scene.</p><p>Sure enough, the young man with three spiritual roots, whom he had seen during the aptitude test, was on the left.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, the avatar saw the swordsman point to the left.  The avatar felt a tug, and amidst envious glances, a flying sword carried him to the left side of the dock.</p><p>Joy filled the avatar’s face.  Without pausing to recover his energy, he straightened his robes and bowed.  "Thank you, senior, for your kindness!"</p><p>"You're quite quick-witted,"</p><p>The swordsman retracted his sword, chuckling.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator examined the avatar, his admiration unconcealed. "Excellent. You dared to be the first, and your resolve is strong. You only faltered when your spiritual energy was almost depleted. Though your talent is somewhat lacking, your mental fortitude is superior to all others. No wonder you successfully overcame the three major bottlenecks. You may well achieve great things in the future.”</p><p>The swordsman stopped laughing and spoke seriously. "He's good material for sword training.  Want to learn swordsmanship at our Feihong Hall?"</p><p>"Junior Brother Ding!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator gave him a reproving look. "These disciples still need the Pavilion Master's approval; he will personally assign them.  The Pavilion Master will consider the Pavilion's needs. As disciples, we shouldn't overstep our bounds."</p><p>The swordsman chuckled, unafraid of his senior brother. "When Pavilion Master assigns them, doesn't he also consider their talents and preferences? This young man's mental fortitude needs no further refinement. Besides our Feihong Hall, where else would be suitable for him?  Should he go to the Zhuding Hall to stoke the fires? I'm merely giving him some guidance to prevent him from going astray."</p><p>A fourth person suddenly interjected, "With such stable mental fortitude, he'd also be a good fit for our Xueying Hall to learn talisman drawing."</p><p>Then he lowered his head, avoiding the glare from the swordsman.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator and the man in the green robe exchanged glances and shook their heads helplessly.</p><p>Before the disciples were even accepted, the infighting had begun.</p><p>The avatar found their argument both amusing and frustrating.  His talent, it turned out, had attracted such competition.  He was thankful he had ‘fallen’ at the right moment and hadn't overdone it.</p><p>Five people remained on the Cloud Bridge, each with cultivation surpassing the avatar’s, all at the tenth or higher level of Qi Condensation.</p><p>One was an elderly man of about sixty, at the thirteenth level of Qi Condensation, the highest among them all.</p><p>The four from Yanmiao Pavilion were discussing whether to accept the old man.</p><p>After a while, the remaining individuals descended. The old man's performance, however, was truly impressive. He persevered almost until his spiritual energy was completely depleted before falling.</p><p>Until the very last moment, buffeted by the wind and the Cloud Bridge's mental illusions, his body swayed like a willow in the wind, yet his mind remained clear, stubbornly persevering.</p><p>As the old man was brought down by the flying sword,</p><p>a hush fell over the dock.</p><p>The four from Yanmiao Pavilion, their playful demeanor gone, looked serious.</p><p>The swordsman let out an almost inaudible sigh, murmuring, "Too old, alas.  Foundation Establishment is out of the question."</p><p>The Xueying Hall cultivator's eyes gleamed, as if he’d seen a treasure, instantly forgetting the avatar.</p><p>"Brother, go and rest,"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator pointed towards the left side of the dock.</p><p>The old man, a shrewd individual, understood immediately that he had been chosen. Though exhausted, he stood up shakily and bowed in gratitude.  "This junior is ashamed of himself!"</p><p>Tears streamed down his wrinkled face.</p><p>No one laughed.</p><p>The cultivators on the right side of the dock looked thoughtful. Some, without waiting for the Yanmiao Pavilion cultivators to announce the results, bowed, and flew away on their flying swords.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists,"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator turned to the right side of the dock. "You have not passed the Cloud Bridge test today. Please leave."</p><p>Though they expected this, some cried openly.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator then turned to the other side. "Though you passed the Cloud Bridge test, you are not yet disciples of Yanmiao Pavilion. You need the Pavilion Master’s approval. Board the ship now."</p><p>With that, the middle-aged cultivator threw out a palm-sized bamboo boat.</p><p>The boat grew with the wind, transforming into a large vessel.  People filed on board, and the ship sped towards the island at the center of the lake.</p><p>The Cloud Bridge had vanished; the mist had dissipated without a trace.</p><p>Soon, the ship brought them to the island, then sailed into the sea fog without hesitation.</p><p>The water mist billowed, parting like giant waves.</p><p>Entering, a vast expanse of white enveloped them, easily disorienting the unwary.</p><p>The group, awestruck, even the experienced Hua Shen, discerned a clue: the fog wasn't a powerful spirit array, just a simple illusionary one.</p><p>Tian Mudie had previously observed Yan Miao Ge; the heart of the fog concealed more than just a lake island—likely a sizable body of water.</p><p>Given Yan Miao Ge's capabilities, they wouldn't be able to maintain such a large, top-tier spirit array; the true protective array lay deeper within.</p><p>Without any apparent effort from the middle-aged cultivator, the bamboo boat navigated the fog, then suddenly burst into the open.</p><p>Vast waves rolled across the lake.</p><p>Several towering green peaks rose from the water, rivaling those outside.</p><p>Jade-white bridges connected these peaks, with figures visible on them.  Some bridges were draped with vines hanging from above, uneven in length, some reaching the water's surface.</p><p>The vines swayed gently in the breeze, like natural curtains, creating a scene of vibrant life.</p><p>A fairyland-like vista unfolded, stunning the impoverished cultivators.</p><p>A look of astonishment crossed Hua Shen's face.</p><p>This scene—mountains within the water, people amongst the mountains—suddenly triggered a buried memory.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Enemies, and loved ones.</p><p>Those memories weren't entirely pleasant, yet this place was where he had undergone several transformations.</p><p>Decades had flown by.  Were his old friends still there?</p><p>"Those peaks ahead are where Yan Miao Ge's gates lie.  This will be your training ground..."</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's words startled them back to attention.  He lightly tapped his foot, propelling the bamboo boat upwards towards one of the peaks.</p><p>Approaching the peak, he flashed a jade token, allowing them to effortlessly ascend to a mid-mountain stone platform where he deposited the group.</p><p>A stone path led straight to the summit from the platform, and between the trees, several imposing halls were faintly visible.</p><p>"Come, let's go see the Pavilion Master!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator led them up the steps.</p>
