<h1>Chapter 1844: Sealing the Mountain</h1><p>The water wave, conjured by the female demon's arcane ability, crashed down with the earth-shattering force of a landslide.</p><p>Such a powerful attack at the outset of their clash inevitably caused tremors within the crystal structure.</p><p>The entire space, formed from a single piece of crystal, reacted as a whole. The vibrations spread rapidly, impossible to conceal from the acute senses of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Other demon cultivators would soon detect the disturbance and come to the rescue.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of hiding. He aimed for a swift victory and retreat before reinforcements arrived.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A deep indentation appeared in the heart of the water wave, faintly revealing the shape of a footprint.</p><p>The footprint pressed directly onto the ground, accompanied by a continuous ‘crackling’ sound.  Countless fine cracks spread around the footprint as the sturdy crystal passage, unable to withstand the force of a single step, threatened to collapse.</p><p>The female demon, bearing the brunt of the attack, was filled with utter terror. She watched helplessly as a monstrous figure broke through the water, radiating immense pressure. Yet, she was powerless to stop him.</p><p>The menacing sword light hovered above her head, carrying the aura of death, preventing her from diverting her attention.</p><p>The clear, resonant sword cry echoed and reverberated through the passage, as powerful as a dragon's roar.</p><p>The sword light, resembling a celestial dragon, seemed capable of shattering the void itself, poised to crush the female demon below.</p><p>Facing imminent death, the female demon's eyes became bloodshot. Fine dragon scales appeared on her face, her head transformed into a horse's head, revealing half of her demonic form. Her open mouth shifted as well, and a suppressed roar finally erupted from her gaping maw.</p><p>It was a shriek of desperation.</p><p>The piercing shriek grated like two pieces of iron scraping together.</p><p>The sound held a power that could shake one's very soul, clearly another of the female demon's arcane abilities.  As the sound reverberated, visible sound waves rippled from her mouth.</p><p>The ripples in the void spread like waves on water, rapidly rotating like a whirlpool, imbued with a strange twisting force that drew everything in the void, even light itself, into its center.</p><p>The center of the swirling sound waves targeted the sword light. The ripples spread so quickly that the sword light seemed suppressed, like a fish caught in a whirlpool, unable to escape.</p><p>A glimmer of hope flashed in the female demon’s eyes, only to be extinguished by a deafening roar as the sound wave vortex shattered before her disbelieving gaze.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The sword light transformed into a white tiger, bursting through the vortex. Its eyes blazed with a terrifying, soul-stirring ferocity, fixed on the female demon as it lunged downwards.</p><p>Her arcane ability had been cleaved in two by a single sword strike!</p><p>It was important to note that this was not the Grey Warbler Sword of the past, but the true spiritual treasure, the Cloud Wanderer Sword!</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had only employed the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, fearing that the Seven Soul Killing Formation would be too powerful, instantly slaying the female demon and leaving him unable to interrogate her.</p><p>The ferocious white tiger was now upon her.</p><p>The female demon could clearly see every single hair on the white tiger, as if it were a true beast.</p><p>Despair deepened on her face as a silver glow flew from her mouth – the oval silver stone hidden in her throat.</p><p>A faint, cloud-like silver rune, its meaning obscure, appeared on the surface of the stone.</p><p>The rune gradually sharpened, and a powerful force was about to erupt from within the silver stone.</p><p>At that moment, a large hand appeared above the silver stone.  Crystalline and translucent, the hand radiated a pure, glazed light.  Palm facing down, it aimed at the silver stone and clenched tightly.</p><p>The hand, unaided by any treasure, grasped the silver stone with its bare flesh, yet with the force of a collapsing mountain.  Amidst the rumbling sound, the rune, still forming, was violently disrupted, trembling and shattering on the spot.</p><p>The silver stone vibrated intensely, its light dimming abruptly before being firmly sucked into the palm.</p><p>The hand’s momentum didn't stop there.  Carrying the silver stone, it continued towards the female demon, its power manifesting as a visible ripple in the void, a fierce wind accompanying the strike.</p><p>The female demon’s face paled. With her arcane abilities and treasure neutralized, she could only raise her arms in a desperate defense. Unfortunately, every move she made was easily predictable in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The female demon took the palm strike head-on.</p><p>Infused with the might of a Dharma Idol and the power of a Buddhist Seal, the strike was unleashed by Qin Sang, whose physical and spiritual cultivation rivaled that of a late Nascent Soul cultivator. Caught completely off guard, how could a mere early Nascent Soul cultivator like her withstand such a blow?</p><p>The female demon screamed as she felt her arms break under the terrifying force.  The hand, carrying her broken limbs, slammed into her chest, shattering the scales on her body.  The terrifying power surged into her, wreaking havoc, sending her flying backwards while coughing up blood.</p><p>Agony wracked her body.  Bathed in blood, the female demon presented a gruesome sight.  Still struggling in mid-air, her eyes were suddenly stung by sword light.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The ferocious white tiger seized the opportunity presented by her open defenses and pounced.  As their forms overlapped, the female demon froze.</p><p>An instant later, the white tiger emerged, seemingly holding something in its mouth.</p><p>‘Thump!’</p><p>The female demon's body crashed heavily to the ground, blood gushing from multiple wounds.</p><p>Only then could one see the numerous sword cuts that had appeared on her body, slicing through flesh and bone, reaching her vital organs, nearly dismembering her.</p><p>Her physical body was lifeless!</p><p>The white tiger turned its head and leaped towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang made no attempt to dodge, reaching out to take what the white tiger held in its mouth before the spectral beast dissipated.</p><p>He glanced down at his hand.  It held a ball of spiritual light, faintly shaped like a dragon-scaled horse beast – the female demon’s nascent spirit.</p><p>A nascent spirit was all he needed to extract the information he sought.</p><p>Qin Sang stored the nascent spirit and beckoned to the demon’s body, preparing to retrieve it and leave.  Suddenly, he sensed rumbling sounds in the distance.</p><p>Listening intently, Qin Sang’s expression shifted.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>It must be other demon cultivators, alerted to the disturbance, coming to the rescue. Judging by the vibrations and sounds, they were breaking through the crystal barriers and heading straight for him with astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even with his current strength, traversing the crystal would not be any easier for him than it was for them.</p><p>“The Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom truly have sent peak cultivators into the Altar of Governance!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare underestimate them.  He collected the demon's body and retreated like lightning, having planned his escape route beforehand.</p><p>Fortunately, he had acted swiftly, defeating the female demon, capturing her nascent spirit in the blink of an eye.  A moment later, escape might have proved far more difficult.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The crystal on one side of the passage exploded as a figure burst through the hole – the stocky man.</p><p>His eyes flashed fiercely as he quickly scanned the passage.  He saw no one, only the lingering echoes of thunder.</p><p>Without hesitation, he transformed into a black streak, pursuing the sound.</p><p>The black streak twisted and turned, traversing several passages until it reached the edge of the crystal, still without catching sight of the enemy.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A furious wind howled, the grey gusts almost tangible as they rushed past the stocky man.  Countless grey horizontal lines appeared in the void.</p><p>Bordering the crystal space was another illusory landscape – a grey hurricane. A wall of grey wind stood before the stocky man.</p><p>From a distance, with unobstructed vision, one could see that the hurricane was actually a gigantic, constantly rotating tornado.</p><p>Wedged between several illusory landscapes, the tornado remained immobile, its fierce winds scraping against the crystal surface.</p><p>The stocky man plunged into the wind wall without hesitation, his vision immediately enveloped in chaos.</p><p>Leaving the crystal space, the suppression on his divine sense lifted.  The stocky man unleashed his powerful divine sense to search, continuing his pursuit, but ultimately finding nothing.</p><p>Certain that he had lost his target, the stocky man’s expression darkened further.  He abandoned the chase and returned the way he came.</p><p>By now, all the demon lords, including Xuan Hou, had gathered at the edge of the crystal space.  Only the female demon was missing.</p><p>Xuan Hou, seeing the blurry figure in the wind, stepped forward and bowed in greeting.  As he realized the stocky man had returned empty-handed, his heart sank.  He said solemnly, “We carefully examined the traces within the passage.  Lord Luo was ambushed.  She barely managed to put up a fight.  Her arcane abilities were almost instantly broken.  The enemy… is extremely powerful!”</p><p>The stocky man remained silent, his face grim.</p><p>Xuan Hou continued, forcing himself to speak, “The attacker doesn't seem to be one of the creatures from the Altar of Governance.  There are some residual traces, but we can't confirm their identity.  Could it be…”</p><p>He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p><p>The stocky man understood his meaning. Could the attacker be like him, a Grand Cultivator who had severed their cultivation?</p><p>As a confidant of the Demon King, Xuan Hou was privy to more secrets.</p><p>This battle concerned the fate of both the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom.  Both sides would spare no effort to control the Divine Court.</p><p>Both sides were fully aware of this.</p><p>The Dao Court would undoubtedly also send Grand Cultivators into the Altar, mingling amongst the other cultivators, their identities temporarily concealed.</p><p>But what purpose would a Grand Cultivator have in ambushing an early Nascent Soul demon lord?  Was it merely to weaken their forces?</p><p>The stocky man couldn’t bring himself to admit that he hadn’t even seen a glimpse of the enemy.  He grunted and tossed the black token in his hand into the air, pointing a finger at its center.  A faint cracking sound could be heard.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>Qin Sang was escaping, examining the female demon's black token.  Suddenly, he heard a ‘crack’ from within the token.  Before he could react, cracks appeared on its surface, and it shattered into several pieces.</p><p>The fragments, devoid of any mystical properties, were now useless.</p><p>His gaze narrowed.  Carrying the fragments, he continued his flight, swiftly passing through several illusory landscapes.  Once he was certain there were no pursuers, he stopped in a field of auspicious clouds.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, he retrieved the female demon’s nascent spirit.</p><p>“Answer a few questions honestly, and I'll spare your life!” Qin Sang stared at the nascent spirit, his voice cold.</p><p>The nascent spirit, in the form of a dragon-scaled horse beast, only the size of a fist and somewhat translucent, was filled with terror.  It dared not resist in the slightest.  "Spare me, Immortal Lord! Spare me! This humble demon will answer everything truthfully, and dare not deceive you…"</p><p>Its voice was rough, like a man's.  If Qin Sang hadn’t seen her human form, it would be hard to imagine her as a female demon.</p><p>The dragon-scaled horse beast knelt on all fours, kowtowing repeatedly.</p><p>Even a demon lord, facing the threat of death, couldn’t maintain her dignity.  She was no different from any ordinary being.</p><p>Qin Sang’s current appearance was monstrous, but the female demon seemed oblivious, addressing him as “Immortal Lord.”</p><p>“Why have you mobilized your forces and come here?” Qin Sang questioned coldly.</p><p>…</p><p>After a round of questioning, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The female demon had indeed answered truthfully, without any attempt to conceal information.</p><p>But she knew too little.  With her cultivation level and status, she hadn’t been privy to the true secrets.</p><p>According to the female demon, she had been recruited by King Yuan Lin after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.  Over the years, her cultivation had improved somewhat, but she remained among the weakest of the demon lords, only qualified to carry out orders.</p><p>Not long ago, she had suddenly received a decree from the Demon King, summoning her and her subordinates to the Demon King’s palace.  They then set off immediately, joining forces with other demon kings at the edge of the Wastelands before proceeding to the Altar of Governance.</p><p>The Ghost Fang Kingdom had acted swiftly, and the Dao Court was no less efficient.  Both sides arrived almost simultaneously.</p><p>During the standoff, the female demon received another decree from the Demon King, ordering her to enter the Altar of Governance with Xuan Hou, accompanied by a mysterious expert from the Great Sage Mansion.</p><p>This confirmed Qin Sang’s earlier suspicions.</p><p>When Qin Sang asked about their purpose within the Altar of Governance, the female demon was bewildered.  She only knew that the Demon King had ordered them to search for something within the Altar, strictly instructing them to find it before the Dao Court.</p><p>The decree didn't specify the treasure's location, only marking several routes.  The treasure was likely hidden within the illusory landscapes along these routes, requiring them to search one by one.</p><p>As for what they were searching for, there was no description.  Every demon cultivator had received a black token.</p><p>There was only one sentence:  When the opportunity arises, the black token will manifest its mystical properties.</p><p>“That black token truly is important!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the fragments in his hand.  Unfortunately, the token contained a fail-safe.  If its owner met with misfortune, others could destroy it remotely.</p><p>Earlier, when examining it, Qin Sang hadn't discerned the black token’s mystical properties, and now, reduced to fragments, it was impossible to discover anything.</p><p>However, based on this information, one thing could be deduced:  both the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom were searching for a supreme treasure, and they were willing to commit their entire strength to obtain it.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no desire for this unknown treasure.</p><p>Regardless of its potential use to him, as a lone cultivator, how could he compete with two colossal powers?</p><p>Even if he managed to seize it and find a hiding place, he wouldn’t be able to take it out of the Altar of Governance.</p><p>Grand Cultivators and Demon Kings possessed incredibly long lifespans.  Guarding the Altar for hundreds or even thousands of years was nothing to them.  Unless Qin Sang intended to remain inside forever.</p><p>“Since they’re searching for a treasure, they shouldn’t want to damage the Altar before it appears,” Qin Sang mused.  “However, once the treasure manifests, there’s no guarantee those Grand Cultivators and Demon Kings won't force their way into the Altar and participate in the struggle for it themselves.  I can only hope they don’t dare take the risk and wait until the treasure is taken out of the Altar before they start fighting…”</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang made a decision. He wouldn't get involved in this conflict.</p><p>As long as the fight for the treasure didn't affect the Altar, he could remain hidden in his cave dwelling, waiting for the storm to pass.  It wouldn't impact him in any way.</p><p>If the Altar were to suffer, he could do nothing.</p><p>Compared to two behemoths, an individual's power was too insignificant.  It would be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot.  His only option would be to escape amidst the chaos.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang's next course of action was to return to his cave dwelling and make preparations.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang closed his hand, keeping his promise not to take the female demon’s life.  He sealed her nascent spirit's senses, storing it in his Altar for later handling.</p><p>The female demon’s cultivation was not low, but he wasn't planning to add her to his forces.</p><p>Because of the Jade Buddha, at least during his time cultivating in the Altar of Governance, Qin Sang wouldn’t recruit any beings with high intelligence.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rush back to his cave dwelling.  He circled the illusory landscapes, confirming that the opposing forces were indeed searching along those designated routes, some already deep within the illusory realms.</p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling, his journey uneventful.</p><p>Opening a gap in the Flower Field Grand Formation, Qin Sang slipped inside and cast a series of hand seals, activating the formation’s most potent concealment and defensive variations.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang slowly descended from the sky, landing on a mountain peak.  Looking down at the vast flower fields below, he furrowed his brow.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, a little late today.</p><p>Wishing everyone a happy reunion.</p>
