<h1>Chapter 1278: Counterattack</h1><p>Chapter 1278: Counterattack</p><p>“Humans? It seems there's a chance we'll meet on the battlefield.”</p><p>Ye Laomo said coldly.</p><p>“It’s said that this person relies on a set of Fire-Controlling Demon Banners; most of his abilities stem from them. Without the banners, he's just a difficult opponent. The Fire-Controlling Demon Banners are external items, and not his innate treasure. We could use them if we seized them. Why don't we devise a strategy to kill him and take the treasure?  Not only would we eliminate a major enemy, but we'd also gain a powerful tool.”</p><p>Master Canghong's eyes flashed with cold light, clearly indicating he'd been planning this for some time.</p><p>He had never met Qin Sang and his knowledge of Qin Sang came from others.  Ye Laomo had clashed with Qin Sang twice. Once, Qin Sang escaped unscathed; the second time, Ye Laomo lost an incarnation.  Presumably, no one understands him better.</p><p>Ye Laomo shook his head, reminding Master Canghong not to underestimate him.  “In the battle of Yuanxu, he couldn't even control that many banners yet, but he already demonstrated extraordinary swordsmanship. He's also skilled in lightning escape, incredibly fast, which is why he escaped. I initially assumed it was an innate ability and didn't suspect his demonic origins.  Furthermore, he's extremely proficient in the Dao of Restrictions, able to move freely within the ancient restrictions in the core area of Yuanxu.  Even without the banners, he's not easy to deal with…”</p><p>“So, even I have to avoid him in the future?” Master Canghong frowned, finally realizing how formidable Qin Sang was.</p><p>“With the example of the Red-haired one,  Old Daoist Zhenyi certainly won't let him be caught alone and allow himself to be manipulated by us. But, we don't need to deliberately avoid him…”</p><p>Ye Laomo snorted coldly,  “The Blood Pool battle was an accident. I had to fight with all my might to secure and protect that jade bone, forcing my incarnation to desperately block him, resulting in its destruction. During the fight, I noticed that although this person can control demonic fire, he hasn't tamed it. I suspect that due to his limited cultivation, there are many flaws.  If we encounter him again, as long as you and I want to leave, he absolutely cannot stop us.  And these flaws, sometimes, are fatal!”</p><p>“But other cultivators can't withstand such terrifying demonic fire; they can only be slaughtered!”</p><p>Master Canghong looked agitated, pacing back and forth, his tone dissatisfied. “We paid such a price, even leading to an unfavorable battle situation, only to retrieve a dead jade bone.  Judging by the results, we shouldn't have been so cautious!”</p><p>Ye Laomo’s eyes flickered, staring at Master Canghong. “Are you blaming me for acting too late? Don't forget, this decision was approved by you and Daoist Tianzheng. Back then, the demon in the Crime God Palace only had a wisp of a soul left, and it nearly caused our entire army to be annihilated. How dangerous it was!  You haven't forgotten, have you? The Blood Lake seal's power is far less than that of the Crime God Palace. This person's body is intact, and he consistently had the strength to impact the seal. He was imprisoned by the Purple Micro Palace because of his excessive bloodlust. Once we couldn't suppress him, we would have become accomplices in releasing a demon, and then I'd lose more than just an incarnation; who in the entire Northern Star Realm could suppress him?”</p><p>Master Canghong was speechless, sighing, “I wasn't blaming you, Daoist Brother, only regretful.  The Purple Micro Palace is extremely mysterious, and other secret realms are intricately connected to it. This was a chance to glimpse ancient secrets, perhaps the only chance in our lives, and we missed it.”</p><p>Ye Laomo, understanding Master Canghong's feelings, softened his tone. “That jade bone is quite peculiar. It's incredibly hard, and seems to retain strange energy, possibly containing information or secret techniques left by this person before his death. If we can decipher it, we might find out something.”</p><p>Master Canghong was dejected, nodding slightly. “Let's hope so! But the pressing matter is the battle situation. The number of top experts in the Two-Realm Alliance has surpassed ours; I'm afraid we won't have a chance to take down the Heavenly Path Alliance.”</p><p>Ye Laomo walked to the snow mountain in the hall and then did something astonishing: he struck the snow mountain with a palm strike.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>In an instant, the snow mountain shattered into pieces.</p><p>The hall was empty, the ancient restrictions vanished, and the snow mountain fragments completely disappeared as if they had never existed.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Daoist Brother, you seem to have been immersed in the battlefield for too long, swayed by the desire for victory and defeat, forgetting our original intention. Or, do you truly have ambitions for dominance? I, Ye Laomo, would be happy to assist you.”</p><p>Turning around, Ye Laomo looked deeply into Master Canghong's eyes.</p><p>Hearing this, Master Canghong was startled.  He bowed his head in thought for a while, then raised his head, his expression calm. "Friend, you mean…"</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Ye Laomo declared decisively, his finger tracing a curve in the air. "I've already ordered men to reinforce the defenses in Yucheng, at the northern entrance to the Zuoyuan, and to retreat all the way there. We'll defend using the spirit formation and the Youjing Tower.  No matter how many experts the Two Realms Alliance has, unless they're willing to pay any price, they won't be able to break through easily. The Two Realms Alliance has endured humiliation for a hundred years; why can't we lie low? As long as it doesn't affect the plan, let them enjoy their brief triumph."</p><p>"This retreat is more than 30,000 li, a hundred years of effort ruined in an instant!"</p><p>Master Canghong sighed, but ultimately agreed to Ye Laomo's plan. "The Two Realms Alliance is now too strong.  There will inevitably be casualties during the retreat. We absolutely must prevent a mutiny. Right, I almost forgot something!"</p><p>Suddenly, Master Canghong gasped and whispered a secret to Ye Laomo, a secret concerning Qin Sang.</p><p>"Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo are at odds. This person was originally a disciple of Shaohua Mountain, but for unknown reasons betrayed his sect. After forming his Nascent Soul, he disguised himself as a demon, not daring to show his true face, likely fearing Dongyang Bo. This shows how deep their hatred is, they're sworn enemies!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Ye Laomo's eyes lit up. "Friend, you have impressive methods, to uncover even this secret! However, while Dongyang Bo is cunning, he shouldn't be foolish enough to help us scheme against our allies at this time. It will likely be difficult to persuade him."</p><p>"How will we know unless we try? It depends on the depth of their hatred. Even if he refuses now, he might not later."</p><p>Master Canghong didn't seem concerned, treating it as an insignificant detail.</p><p>They were about to discuss other matters when someone reported from outside the hall that the forward camp was under attack.  This time, the Two Realms Alliance's attack was fierce and unlike anything before.</p><p>"They came quickly!"</p><p>The two were secretly alarmed and quickly made arrangements.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance had split its forces into three groups, launching a counteroffensive.</p><p>When the Blood Lake opened, Zhenyi Laodao dispatched troops to proactively attack, clashing with Master Canghong several times.  Without the help of a Demon King, he was at a disadvantage, so he concentrated his forces in the two large camps at Shiqu Mountain and Wangdong City.</p><p>At this time, Zhenyi Laodao and Tongyou Mojun were commanding the armies in these two camps respectively.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun were in the center, leading the newly gathered forces of the various grandmasters.  They had just made a name for themselves, their foundation was shallow, and their forces were the weakest of the three groups, but also the most flexible, able to support the flanks at any time.</p><p>Zhenyi Laodao was worried that Qin Sang and Qing Jun lacked battlefield experience and might fall into an ambush, so he deliberately arranged it this way.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>This is yesterday's report.</p>
