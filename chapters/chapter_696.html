Chapter 688: Killing Intent


Qin Sang flew onward without a word, seemingly oblivious to the pursuer's actions.
The pursuer grew bolder, no longer hiding their intent, trailing closely behind but maintaining a safe distance.
Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, hovering above the water, and turned to face the pursuer.
The pursuer also halted their magical flight, confronting Qin Sang across the vast sea. They showed no impatience, rather seeming pleased with this development.
“Go on ahead,” Qin Sang instructed, then suddenly lunged forward, merging with his sword and chasing after the pursuer.
The pursuer immediately turned and fled, their magical flight as fast as Qin Sang's, indicating they were at least at the Core Formation stage.
Qin Sang didn't relent. His sword's glow intensified, brilliant and dazzling.  Amidst rumbling thunder, it shot forward like lightning, utilizing the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique.
The distance between them rapidly closed.
Startled, the pursuer, despite fleeing with all their might, couldn't outpace Qin Sang.  They hastily retrieved an item from their storage pouch and slapped it onto their body. Their speed surged, matching Qin Sang's Sword Qi Thunder Sound.
Seeing this, Qin Sang stopped the pursuit, his eyes narrowing thoughtfully.
He had seen the pursuer use a talisman in their panic.  The talisman granted them a speed comparable to his Sword Qi Thunder Sound, suggesting the pursuer's cultivation wasn't exceptionally high.
A plan formed in Qin Sang's mind. Feigning exhaustion, he turned his sword and returned to the elderly couple and the others.
“Senior, he must be waiting for reinforcements to ambush us,” the old man said, his voice trembling with fear, as he saw Qin Sang return empty-handed and the pursuer resume their brazen tailing.  He had never encountered someone so audacious, daring to kill and steal near Sunstone Island.
Qin Sang didn't need the reminder; he had already considered it.
But he thought deeper.
The island lord of Sunstone Island was a Nascent Soul grandmaster, the undisputed ruler of the surrounding seas. No one dared break the rules he set.  This anomaly must have a cause.
“Could something have happened to Sunstone Island or the Demonic Sea in the past few years?” Qin Sang wondered.  His cultivation consumed him entirely, and he hadn't returned to Sunstone Island during that time. Even if something happened, Ran Luo wouldn't be able to contact him.
Sunstone Island had been peaceful for many years, and the island lord wasn't nearing the end of his lifespan.  Trouble arising at this time was unexpected.
Returning to Sunstone Island rashly might plunge him into chaos, which Qin Sang wished to avoid.
With this thought, Qin Sang glanced at the figure persistently trailing them. Perhaps he could learn what had happened from this person.
The five Foundation Establishment cultivators with him were more of a burden than help. Even with the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang didn't dare risk being surrounded. He might lose any chance of escape.
The pursuer's companions were likely nearby. Delaying further would be dangerous.
If the pursuer harbored malicious intentions, they couldn't blame him for being ruthless.
Making up his mind, Qin Sang transmitted a message: “Take my illusion and continue forward.  Don't act strangely. I'll confront him again. If you see us fighting, return to Sunstone Island immediately for help, or hide somewhere after escaping his sight. Don’t worry about me; I can escape on my own.”
After a quick discussion and finalizing the plan, the group suddenly accelerated their magical flight.  The pursuer also increased their speed.
But they failed to notice that, at the same moment, under the cover of the others' magical flight, Qin Sang employed a Daoist technique to summon a lifelike illusion while he stealthily submerged into the sea.
Such illusions were easily seen through by cultivators of the same realm.
However, the pursuer was far away, and the illusion was sufficient to deceive them.
The others, carrying Qin Sang's illusion, flew onward without looking back.  Qin Sang, using the Spirit Concealment Technique, lurked beneath the surface, waiting for the pursuer to approach.
Soon, the pursuer, a young man in his twenties wearing a strange black robe, caught up.  His gaze was fixed on the elderly couple and the others, seemingly unaware of the trap below.
Just as the black-robed youth was about to pass over Qin Sang's hiding spot, the calm water surface shattered like a mirror, and a lightning-fast sword beam shot out from the fragments.
In an instant, the thunder transformed into a spiritual sword, reaching the black-robed youth, killing intent exposed!
Qin Sang had confirmed again that the black-robed youth's cultivation was similar to Du Han's and acted decisively.
Unexpectedly, the black-robed youth showed no panic.  Instead, a sinister smile appeared on his face, and he sneered, "I saw you a long time ago!"
“Golden Radiance Armor!”
The black-robed youth shouted.  Dazzling golden light erupted from his body, transforming into golden armor that encased him in the nick of time.
Seeming confident in the armor, the black-robed youth faced the spiritual sword without dodging.  He sneered, “Sword Qi Thunder Sound.  It seems you're an elite human…”
In that split second, the Ebony Wood Sword also thrust forward.
But faster than the Ebony Wood Sword was a burst of eerie blood-red light.
The Golden Radiance Armor was useless against the blood light, which pierced through and splashed onto the black-robed youth.
“What is this?!” the black-robed youth cried out.
Tainted by the blood light, his inner armor's spiritual power diminished greatly, and the majestic golden armor rapidly dimmed.  Alarmed, the black-robed youth lost his composure and tried to dodge, but his movements were too slow against the Ebony Wood Sword.
The Ebony Wood Sword shattered the golden armor.  However, just as it was about to pierce the black-robed youth, it met resistance.
A crisp cracking sound echoed as the black robe was shredded by the sword Qi, revealing a golden inner armor beneath.
A crack now appeared on the inner armor!
The toughness of the black-robed youth's inner armor surprised Qin Sang.  Though the Blood Defilement Divine Light could taint the spiritual essence of magical treasures, it didn't affect their physical properties.
This inner armor must be crafted from an extremely hard spiritual material.
The Ebony Wood Sword, momentarily impeded, immediately thrust towards the crack in the armor. This time, the sword's shadow flickered, creating a realistic illusory sword beam.
The black-robed youth was shocked.  He retreated rapidly as cyan light surged from his dantian, forming a human-sized illusion of a spirit insect before him.
This spirit insect had massive mandibles filled with sharp teeth. Its mouth opened wide, biting both the Ebony Wood Sword and its illusory counterpart.
