<h1>Chapter 2262:  Consumed by Fire</h1><p>After questioning the mysterious Azure Roc, Qin Sang was greatly disappointed.</p><p>It turned out that the mysterious Azure Roc was trapped by the enemy, its Star Soul clouded, its divine abilities impaired.  The range Qin Sang could see was already the limit, and this range was unchangeable.  In other words, even if Qin Sang traveled thousands of miles to the border, he could only see the original area, unless the mysterious Azure Roc was freed.</p><p>The first attempt failed, but Qin Sang wouldn't give up.  As long as he couldn't find the stone pavilion, he could continue to use his "heart demon" as an excuse to ask the mysterious Azure Roc for help in searching.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Roc was not surprised by this result. After all, something manifested from a heart demon had a very low probability of appearing in the mortal world.</p><p>“Unable to… find the… root cause… can only… try to suppress… overcome this hurdle…”</p><p>Qin Sang, of course, didn't have a heart demon, but he had to cooperate with the mysterious Azure Roc and continue to play along.</p><p>A glimmer of hope flashed in his eyes, and he respectfully said, "Please guide me, senior!"</p><p>There are two ways to resolve a heart demon: one is to address the cultivator's inner self – the best method, offering a permanent solution; the other is to seek external objects, using outside forces to suppress it.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart demon was baffling.  Since the mysterious Azure Roc wasn't with Qin Sang, using the first method was impossible, leaving only the second option.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Roc had already devised a plan for Qin Sang, immediately saying, "You… must return… to your clan…"</p><p>"I wonder if there's still time," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The celestial omen appeared; that treasure could manifest at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang was anxious to find the stone pavilion because he didn't know what changes the treasure's appearance would bring to the illusion, worried it might make the problem even more intractable.</p><p>"Don't be reckless…"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Roc was still advising Qin Sang to wait until he returned from the Azure Roc clan, obtained the treasure, before considering a breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Junior will depart tomorrow!"</p><p>Having spoken, he meditated on the spot. The next morning, he collected his formations and left.</p><p>Returning to the Azure Roc clan's territory, Qin Sang felt that the atmosphere within the clan hadn't changed, indicating that his theft of the Azure Sky Thunder hadn't been discovered.</p><p>In the war, most of the casualties were among the Phoenix clan's vassals and members of various branches.  Only a small number of pure-blooded Phoenixes perished on the battlefield.</p><p>The Azure Roc clan remained peaceful and serene, untouched by the war's gloom.</p><p>However, once a war begins, the hatred between the two sides grows stronger, and the Phoenix clan doesn't control when it ends.  One day, the Phoenix clan will inevitably be dragged into it.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled onward, eventually reaching a lakeside. Standing by the lake, gazing ahead, a light mist floated on the surface, with shadowy mountain ranges vaguely visible in the distance—clearly a beautiful place.</p><p>"Senior, I've arrived at the Li Lake."</p><p>Qin Sang found a hiding place by the lake and communicated with the mysterious Azure Roc.</p><p>At that moment, two Azure Rocs flew overhead, circling Li Lake as if patrolling their territory, without noticing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, watched the two Azure Rocs fly away, then lowered his gaze, staring into the depths of Li Lake.</p><p>This Li Lake was the home of a large family within the Azure Roc clan.</p><p>In the center of Li Lake, rolling hills could be seen, teeming with countless peculiar spirit trees.</p><p>Ancient trees towered, their crowns intertwined.</p><p>Though it was a family's dwelling place, it wasn't like human settlements with palaces and houses.  Some of the Azure Roc clan members' dwellings were built around the spirit trees, hidden in the canopy; more elaborate ones used formations to carve out separate secluded realms, making them invisible from the outside.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose was to infiltrate the depths of Li Lake and steal the fruit of a particular spirit tree.</p><p>This fruit is called Li Fruit, and the tree is called Li Tree.</p><p>There's a heavenly realm called Li Spring. Legend says a tributary once flowed from Li Spring through Li Lake. Though the tributary dried up, it left behind a patch of unique spirit trees along the riverbed.</p><p>The family who later acquired this place named the trees, fruit, and lake "Li."</p><p>This family cherishes the Li Fruit, which has extraordinary effects, one of which is cleansing the user's mind and suppressing heart demons.</p><p>The Li Fruit only suppresses heart demons; unless a cultivator already has a way to resolve their heart demon, the Li Fruit can be used as an external medicine to increase the chance of success.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Roc places great importance on Qin Sang. If possible, it would prefer Qin Sang to directly resolve his heart demon.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation advancement was unusually rapid, unlike other practitioners.  His mental fortitude lagged behind, leaving him vulnerable to inner demons. Suppressing them forcefully risked future, far more dangerous outbursts.</p><p>However, the necessary remedies were invaluable treasures, virtually unattainable for Qin Sang, a lone cultivator.  Time was of the essence, precluding elaborate plans.</p><p>Stealing the Spirit Fruits was the fastest option; they had no other choice.  Furthermore, these fruits greatly benefited Qingluan cultivators, offering Qin Sang additional advantages.</p><p>"Go to the lake bottom... find a hidden river..."</p><p>A mysterious Qingluan instructed Qin Sang to infiltrate Li Lake.</p><p>Following the instructions, Qin Sang entered Li Lake and immediately sensed the hidden restrictions within the water.  As a family territory, the defenses were naturally formidable.</p><p>Remaining calm, Qin Sang avoided triggering any restrictions, descending to the lake bed. After a search, he found the hidden river's source.</p><p>"Enter,"</p><p>the mysterious Qingluan sighed, "Years ago... I... also stole Spirit Fruits... After my cultivation improved... I secretly compensated them...  Never imagined... I'd return..."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought the Qingluan had done this before and that this hidden river might have been its creation.</p><p>Entering the river, Qin Sang suppressed his aura, arms crossed over his chest like a corpse, letting the swift current carry him into darkness.</p><p>The river was winding and labyrinthine, its turns countless.  Following instructions, Qin Sang only used hand seals at crucial points, doing nothing else.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, gazing at the stone wall above.  "Senior, I seem to sense the Spirit Tree's aura."</p><p>He had effortlessly bypassed the numerous protections, reaching the Spirit Tree undetected by the entire clan's experts.</p><p>"The time is right... the Spirit Fruits should be ripe... Take them... three are enough... more is unnecessary..."</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan imparted the harvesting technique.</p><p>Three weren’t enough!</p><p>Qin Sang thought, since he went through the trouble, he might as well take more.  The extra fruits could bolster Yuanjing Mountain's development.  Yuanjing Mountain disciples had superior techniques, but lacked mental cultivation, and consuming a fruit greatly increased their chances of surviving the tribulation.</p><p>He wondered if the treasure within the illusion would help Liuli, and he needed to keep some for himself as well.</p><p>Qin Sang halted, sensing the external aura, confirming no abnormalities before using the technique.  White frost surged from his palm, swirling faster and faster.  Suddenly, a red glow flickered on the stone wall, and a crimson fruit fell.</p><p>The fruit fell into the frost, instantly encased in ice. This was the optimal preservation method.</p><p>Having easily obtained one, Qin Sang continued, harvesting all the ripe fruits from that tree before moving on to the next.  Before discovery, he successfully escaped.</p><p>Regardless of the clan's fury upon discovering the theft, Qin Sang immediately left the Qingluan territory and returned to the battlefield.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang would stage a breakthrough. In fact, he'd already reached the threshold, and as expected, the breakthrough wasn't difficult.</p><p>...</p><p>In his temporary cave.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated while awaiting the 'right moment' for his breakthrough.</p><p>Suddenly, he awoke from his meditation, another celestial omen appearing, different from before.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, unable to define the feeling or pinpoint the problem.</p><p>"Something's wrong..."</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan sensed it as well, adding that before falling silent.</p><p>...</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a peak, watching the dissipating thunderclouds, the surroundings reduced to ruins by the tribulation.  Sensing his powerful strength, he sighed.</p><p>He had finally regained his Transcendent Void stage combat power!</p><p>"Avatar..."</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Qingluan avatar.  It was solid, not an illusion.</p><p>The avatar spread its wings, circled Qin Sang, and landed before him.  Meeting its gaze, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.  Though more vibrant than before, it was still his.</p><p>"Continue cultivation and I can restore my real-world cultivation base," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang hadn't yet broken through the mid-sixth level of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.  He wondered if he could achieve this breakthrough within the illusion.</p><p>This thought had barely crossed his mind when Qin Sang's expression changed subtly; he sensed another celestial omen.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan was engaged in battle and didn't react, but Qin Sang was certain it had also sensed it.</p><p>Over the years, these omens had not only become more frequent but also strangely different.  Perhaps the omens hadn't changed, but his perception of them had sharpened.</p><p>Returning to his cave, after waiting some time, the mysterious Azure Luan’s voice reached him, “You broke through?”</p><p>“I succeeded! I now possess a true Dharma form!”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was elated, but then turned grave.  “After the breakthrough, the illusion reappeared, and the pavilion seems closer, right before me…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, the Azure Luan interrupted.</p><p>“Later…there will be a way! Now…you must…do something else…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively, a look of surprise on his face.  The Azure Luan wanted him to find a place of absolute safety and remain there.</p><p>“Senior, didn’t you say the treasure is most likely to appear on the battlefield? Has the omen changed?”</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  Nowhere near a battlefield could be considered safe.</p><p>He had planned to move among the most intense battlefronts, waiting for the treasure's emergence.</p><p>“We may have…miscalculated.  Go…quickly!”</p><p>The Azure Luan offered little explanation, but Qin Sang guessed it had sensed something from the omen.</p><p>Where could he ensure his safety now?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. The Azure Luan hadn't specified a location, suggesting any place would suffice.</p><p>He needed to be far from other powerful cultivators, ideally away from all living beings.  The celestial city was out of the question, and desolate places inhabited by creatures presented other dangers.</p><p>After much consideration, the safest place he could think of was Mount Yuji.</p><p>Mount Yuji’s protective formation, once activated, could withstand attacks from Nascent Soul cultivators—the strongest warriors in this illusion, as even powerful figures from the higher realms were trapped within.</p><p>Simply hiding wasn't an option.</p><p>His two senior sisters were trustworthy.  Entrusting them with the formation would allow for timely responses to any danger.</p><p>The Azure Luan's tone was urgent.  Qin Sang, not daring to delay, quickly established some merit, made the necessary arrangements, and hurried back to Mount Yuji.</p><p>His two senior sisters, having received his message, were waiting for him at the summit.</p><p>“Junior Brother is also going into seclusion?”</p><p>The two women were delighted but also slightly worried.  First, with Qin Sang at the forefront, Yuanjing Mountain could develop peacefully.  Second, their master had been in seclusion for years without any sign, and they feared Qin Sang might meet the same fate.</p><p>But these were not reasons to stop Qin Sang.  The two women solemnly took on the responsibility of the sect, urging Qin Sang to cultivate peacefully without worry.</p><p>“This is my understanding of Mount Yuji's formation.  In some time, Yuanjing Mountain will be able to cultivate enough disciples. If chaos erupts, they can be stationed at various key points…”</p><p>Qin Sang gave the two women a jade slip, along with various treasures like spirit herbs.  With these, Yuanjing Mountain's foundation would surpass many sects, lacking only time.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang carved out a restricted area on Mount Yuji and established a secluded cave.</p><p>Without the Azure Luan's guidance, Qin Sang dared not leave, cultivating continuously on Mount Yuji.</p><p>Years passed.</p><p>The omens became clearer and more frequent.</p><p>Seven years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating as usual when his expression shifted; another omen!</p><p>Meanwhile, at Yuanjing Mountain…</p><p>All the disciples knew that there was a forbidden area in the back mountain—the cave dwelling of the sect’s founder.</p><p>Since joining the sect, they had only heard legends of the founder, never seeing him, shrouded in mystery.</p><p>As Yuanjing Mountain prospered, the legends surrounding Master Tong Shen evolved.  In the disciples' minds, he was a powerful cultivator, and Qing Hong and the others would never reveal the truth about their master.</p><p>Inside the cave in the back mountain…</p><p>Master Tong Shen sat cross-legged, the spiritual light of the meditation cushion dim, his person radiating a withered aura, a testament to the passage of time.</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>The long-silent Tong Shen's eyelids fluttered, his eyes slowly opening.</p><p>His gaze was distant, as if seeing through the stone walls and across the world, a look of understanding flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"Such a pity…"</p><p>This was his last sound in the world.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A raging fire erupted beneath him, instantly engulfing him, illuminating the cave.</p><p>When the flames subsided, he was gone, as if reduced to ashes.</p>
