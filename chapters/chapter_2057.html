<h1>Chapter 2048: Wilderness</h1><p>The *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation* was the crystallized wisdom of everyone present, and also a catalyst. The process of exchange was also a process of self-reflection, inevitably filled with debate.  Truth becomes clearer through discussion. When this esoteric art was completed, everyone felt their Artifact Refinement skills had subtly ascended to a new level.</p><p>The *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation* was more like a guiding principle. Everyone continued to contemplate it, and further developments would surely follow, branching out in different directions based on their individual cultivation methods.</p><p>Even if these future developments didn't surpass the original, they would still be considered top-tier esoteric arts of Artifact Refinement, worthy of being passed down as core inheritances.</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade slip, his mind not fully withdrawn from the *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation*, and simultaneously, he thought of the Cloud Roaming Sword.</p><p>Whether this technique could help the Cloud Roaming Sword become a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure remained to be seen, but it was certain that after comprehending this esoteric art, he would be much more confident than before.</p><p>“Although I questioned Elder Qin many times before, I truly admire Elder Qin's ingenious ideas."</p><p>Perhaps because they had become more familiar with each other, the Yu surnamed cultivator spoke more, unlike the arrogance he displayed during their first meeting.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu is right. We siblings also gained much inspiration from Elder Qin,” the male head of the strange cultivator bowed respectfully to Qin Sang, very enthusiastic. The female head also looked at Qin Sang with more warmth.</p><p>The others also wore expressions of deep agreement.</p><p>In terms of Artifact Refinement, Lady Shuanghua was undoubtedly the strongest. It was rumored that her husband was a descendant of a major Artifact Refinement sect in Xun Province.  Later, for unknown reasons, they had a falling out, and she came to Kan Province alone with her daughter.</p><p>But everyone's thinking had limitations.  In contrast, Qin Sang always introduced fresh ideas.</p><p>"I wonder which sect Elder Qin hails from?" Lady Shuanghua asked curiously.</p><p>“My sect suffered a calamity, and the mountain gate was destroyed many years ago. I was fortunate enough to receive part of its inheritance and have been exploring the path of Artifact Refinement on my own, taking many detours."</p><p>What Qin Sang said was indeed the truth.</p><p>His journey in learning Artifact Refinement could be divided into two parts. The first was in the Storm Realm, where he drew on the strengths of many. The latter was when he received the inheritance of the Profound Mystery Temple, a Dao Sect, and finally had a clear lineage.</p><p>The origins of the Profound Mystery Temple were related to the Dao Court and could not be revealed to outsiders.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was unwilling to reveal his lineage, everyone assumed he had unspeakable difficulties and tactfully refrained from asking further.</p><p>Realist Tonghu leaned against a rock, his chest and belly exposed, savoring fine wine with a relaxed expression. “If there's an opportunity in the future, we should hold more of these Dao Discussion conferences. What do you all think?”</p><p>Lady Shuanghua looked towards the blue waves beyond the mountains, her gaze distant, and did not express her opinion.</p><p>The two heads of the strange cultivator looked at each other, their lips moving slightly, as if communicating with themselves, and finally fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to plan his trip to the Sea of Mist and didn't know when he would have the opportunity to return to Kan Province.</p><p>The Yu surnamed cultivator had been eager to participate, but seeing this situation, he couldn't help but lose interest, shaking his head without speaking.  They were originally strangers, gathered by the invitation of the Luo Hua Temple.  There would likely be no such opportunity again in the future.</p><p>The atmosphere became somewhat awkward.  Everyone lost their enthusiasm.  After a few more casual exchanges, some began to take their leave.</p><p>“There’s still some distance to Yanling City. There’s no need to rush our parting. I happen to have some questions I’d like to consult with you all,” Realist Tonghu sat up, reaching out to grab his dragon-headed crutch.</p><p>Others also prepared to depart.</p><p>Only Qin Sang, after rising, bowed to everyone and said, “Fellow Daoists, I have an urgent matter to attend to and cannot travel with you. I must bid you farewell here.”</p><p>Seeing that his expression was sincere, everyone couldn't force him to stay.  The Yu surnamed cultivator gave Qin Sang a jade pendant and said, “Elder Qin, if you have free time, please bring this token to Yu Island near Qiyuan City. I will certainly welcome you with open arms."</p><p>Everyone then exchanged tokens. Qin Sang could only say that he currently had no fixed abode but would establish a base in Sleepless City in the future.</p><p>Watching everyone fly away on clouds, Qin Sang took the two brothers and flew around the nearby sea, choosing a relatively secluded island to land on.  He meticulously set up a grand formation and opened a cave dwelling.</p><p>Mist rose from the sea, enveloping the island. Qin Sang instructed the two brothers to keep watch outside and entered the cave, summoning the Fire Lotus.</p><p>The Dao Discussion conference had lasted nearly a year. Qin Sang was concerned about the Qilin Source Seed, but he couldn't leave.  Fortunately, after such a long time, the Qilin Source Seed remained as before, without any further changes.</p><p>Summoning the Fire Lotus, Qin Sang focused his senses. The Qilin Source Seed's fluctuations were still there, and he couldn't help but ponder.</p><p>According to his previous speculation, he likely needed to actively circulate the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to trigger the next level of change.</p><p>According to Zhuque, the cultivator of this technique was the human field incubating the Qilin Source Seed. When the third level of the esoteric art was achieved, Lotus Transforming into Lotus Platform, the Qilin would be reborn from him.</p><p>In other words, the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was also a crucial step in the Qilin's revival. Qin Sang had disrupted the Qilin's plan, but this step was probably indispensable.</p><p>Since learning the truth and plotting against the Qilin, Qin Sang had stopped cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. However, this technique wasn't entirely reliant on refining spiritual fire for improvement. Over the years, he had been extracting the essence of the Qilin Source Seed, and there was no more suitable power than this.  Subtly, this esoteric art had been continuously advancing.  As long as he willed it, he could immediately break through to the third level and achieve mastery!</p><p>However, before doing so, he had to carefully consider it to avoid any oversights and endless future troubles.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Zhuque again, sharing his thoughts and concerns, and seeking Zhuque's opinion.</p><p>When encountering important matters, Zhuque knew the gravity of the situation and didn't continue to act foolishly. After pondering for a long time, it stared and said, "We've done all we can. Logically, there shouldn't be any more oversights.  Might as well bite the bullet and do it!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhuque's bright little eyes. This indeed sounded like something it would say.  His thoughts were similar, though. No matter what, he had to hatch the Qilin.  Doing it sooner might offer a chance to remedy any unforeseen issues.</p><p>"You guard me!"</p><p>His mind made up, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  Putting aside all distracting thoughts, his mind merged with the Fire Lotus, and the contents of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* surfaced in his mind.</p><p>Despite not having cultivated it for a long time, Qin Sang circulated the technique without any hindrance, carefully observing the changes in the Fire Lotus and the Qilin Source Seed while activating the esoteric art.</p><p>As soon as the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* circulated, flickering flames appeared on the surface of the Fire Lotus, making it brighter.  The layered petals began to tremble subtly.</p><p>The firelight reflected on Qin Sang's face rippled.  The already blooming lotus seemed to expand further, stretching its petals.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately grasped the source of the change – the heart of the Fire Lotus. He also discovered an imperceptible change in the Qilin Source Seed.  His divine sense had almost replaced the outer shell of the Qilin Source Seed, yet he still couldn't determine whether this change was beneficial or detrimental to him.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang stopped, while Zhuque stared intently at the heart of the lotus.</p><p>Patiently sensing for a long time, Qin Sang discussed it with Zhuque again and continued to activate the esoteric art.</p><p>A strange scene unfolded within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Between Qin Sang and Zhuque, a Fire Lotus hovered in mid-air, its petals trembling slightly, and faint flames of nothingness flickered on its surface.</p><p>As time passed, the trembling of the petals became more pronounced, and the flames of nothingness fluctuated, as if a stream of fire could erupt at any moment.</p><p>Something was gestating within the heart of the lotus, on the verge of emerging, pushing the petals outward. Gradually, the outermost layer of petals fully unfurled, followed by the second layer continuing to expand.</p><p>During this process, the Fire Lotus also grew.  The firelight at the heart of the lotus became increasingly intense. The Qilin Source Seed emitted fluctuations, but they were invisible.</p><p>Before long, the thing gestating within the Fire Lotus finally matured.  A faint outline could be seen, resembling a lotus seed pod growing within the flower's heart, or a circular platform.  The lotus petals continued to unfurl until the Fire Lotus transformed into a Lotus Platform.</p><p>The Qilin Source Seed rested quietly on the Lotus Platform.  Its Qi had changed subtly, forming a new connection with the platform, transforming along with the platform's birth.</p><p>Up to this point, everything was still under Qin Sang’s control.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>Zhuque's expression was tense, and it couldn't help but remind him.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed not to hear.  His mind held only the esoteric art, forgetting everything else.  Sensing the impending breakthrough, he didn't hesitate and charged towards the bottleneck!</p><p>With one surge of energy, he finally stepped into the third level, achieving mastery of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A brilliant stream of light flowed across the Lotus Platform, illuminating the cave dwelling in radiant colors.</p><p>The Lotus Platform rotated slowly, its beauty indescribable, like a naturally formed treasure.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had no time to admire it.  As the esoteric art broke through, he felt his divine sense undergoing a transformation, but he had no time to comprehend his gains, pouring all his focus into the Qilin Source Seed.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Qilin Source Seed had undergone a mutation. Within the chaotic spirituality, a consciousness was gradually strengthening.  The Qilin True Spirit was reviving, and very rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened.  Not only could he not withdraw the divine sense that constituted the Qilin Source Seed, but he had to pour more into it, reinforcing it, adding a layer of shackles to the Qilin True Spirit.</p><p>At the same time, he didn't forget Zhuque's previous instructions.  While the Qilin True Spirit was still between wakefulness and slumber, before its intelligence fully formed, he had to leave his imprint on its foundation, becoming its master.</p><p>Although he was taking advantage of a vulnerable moment, the process was much more arduous than Qin Sang had imagined. He had to constantly monitor every subtle change, and be extremely careful when imprinting, so as not to trigger the Qilin True Spirit’s instinctive resistance.</p><p>Fortunately, he had just broken through, and his divine sense felt inexhaustible.  Just as Qin Sang was exerting all his effort, a strange feeling arose in his heart.</p><p>In the vast unknown, something seemed to exist within the Qilin Source Seed, revealing the tip of the iceberg with the revival of the Qilin True Spirit, stirring Qin Sang’s heart. This existence wasn’t a tangible object, but a faint, elusive Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang did sense it, but now was the crucial moment to imprint, and he was temporarily unable to examine what it was.</p><p>As the Qilin True Spirit revived, that consciousness rapidly strengthened, quickly approaching the level of a true living being. However, this being's life force seemed somewhat weak, as if inherently deficient.</p><p>In fact, almost all the essence of the Qilin Source Seed had been extracted by Qin Sang and Zhuque, leaving only a small portion to barely sustain the Qilin True Spirit.  Inherent deficiency was only natural.</p><p>‘Whew!’</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled a turbid breath.  He worked tirelessly, with all his might, and finally, before this consciousness was fully born, he imprinted it, and the consciousness offered no resistance!</p><p>Successfully completing this step alleviated most of his worries.  Even if problems arose later, he could activate the imprint and suppress them.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang came back to his senses, the consciousness within the Qilin True Spirit had also developed to a certain extent, showing signs of stagnation.</p><p>Seeing the scene before him, Qin Sang was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected Zhuque's words to be true.  What lay on the Lotus Platform now could no longer be called a Source Seed.  It was clearly an egg.</p><p>He had actually hatched a Qilin egg!</p><p>A strong life force emanated from the Qilin egg.</p><p>Perhaps due to its inherent deficiency, or perhaps it was meant to be this way, the Qilin True Spirit didn't immediately emerge after reviving. The consciousness was slumbering within the egg and needed a period of gestation before hatching.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang’s intervention, this egg was largely composed of his divine sense. In other words, until the Qilin hatched, his divine sense would remain tied here.</p><p>“When all of this returns, I wonder how much my divine sense will grow?  Apart from the portion left for the Qilin True Spirit, and the small portion given to Zhuque, I've absorbed most of the essence of the Qilin Source Seed…”</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with anticipation, but he also knew the priorities and wouldn't drain the pond to catch the fish.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Zhuque stared intently at the Lotus Platform. It hadn't expected to see an egg instead of a Qilin and was quite dissatisfied.</p><p>“Patience.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. With a thought, his mind sank into the Qilin egg again, searching for the Qi he had previously locked onto.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang found his target. Upon contact, his mind was greatly shaken.</p><p>Like drums and zithers being played, a vast sound came from beyond the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was pulled into an unfamiliar world. He saw a vast wilderness.</p><p>Lush vegetation, towering mountains, as if he had been thrown into a prehistoric land, a desolate air washed over him.</p><p>The next moment, a celestial phenomenon appeared. The sky turned crimson, boundless rosy clouds filled the heavens, and then a stream of fire descended from the dome.</p><p>The stream of fire fell towards a dark mountain, not causing the earth to collapse, but the ensuing inferno brought apocalyptic destruction to the wilderness.</p><p>In an instant, the land was scorched, stretching for thousands of miles, all life extinguished.</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to see what was within the stream of fire, but to no avail. After the stream of fire landed, it vanished without a trace. The vision ended there, and Qin Sang was pushed out of the illusion.</p><p>“What did you see?” Zhuque asked repeatedly, seeing Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and recounted everything he had seen.</p><p>After listening, Zhuque became incredibly excited. “This is likely the place where the last of the Qilin's origin fell. This Qilin probably encountered some danger and was forced to separate its origin, hiding it here.  In its final moments, it sent this scene into the Source Seed, waiting for the True Spirit to revive and retrieve it.  Did you get any other information?  Can you tell where that place is?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “There's only this one image within that Qi.”</p><p>“Impossible! Absolutely impossible!”</p><p>Zhuque shook its head like a rattle-drum.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt it shouldn't be so simple. He hadn't found any special markers in this image.</p><p>The Yao resided in the vast, boundless wilderness, and such wildernesses were everywhere.</p><p>Even if that Qilin was active before the rise of humanity, the Eight Great Celestial Provinces weren't lacking in such places. Moreover, there were endless wildernesses between the Eight Great Celestial Provinces. With only one image, it was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>A thought struck him, and he exchanged a look with Zhuque, both turning to the Qilin egg.</p><p>[Recommending a friend’s book, *A Casual Swordsman in Gu Long's World*, it's doing very well.
