<h1>Chapter 930: The Transaction</h1><p>Chapter 930: The Transaction</p><p>Elder Fang's appearance caused a stir, but it quickly subsided.</p><p>The cultivators waited silently.</p><p>Past midnight.</p><p>The High Priestess' expression shifted slightly. Her lips parted: "Daoist Lingzhuzi, the time has come. I shall now activate the Thousand Swords Array."</p><p>Lingzhuzi made a calculation with his fingers and said gravely, "This immortal array is at its weakest point. We will do our utmost to assist the High Priestess in breaking the array. Let us begin."</p><p>With that, Lingzhuzi waved his whisk. The other Nascent Soul cultivators dispersed, taking positions at the edge of the great array, and began to infuse their spiritual energy into the array.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators were agitated, retreating for fear of being affected by the array's aftershocks, yet unwilling to miss this opportunity to observe, they did not retreat too far.</p><p>Soon, the two groups of Nascent Soul cultivators were positioned.</p><p>At the center of the array, Lingzhuzi and Elder Fang stood on either side of the High Priestess.</p><p>The High Priestess took a deep breath, gently raising her jade hand. Ripples formed on the water's surface below, and a milky white point of light rose slowly from the seabed, gradually elongating into a slender, spiritual sword.</p><p>Next, the High Priestess produced a pouch.</p><p>Holding it downwards, a flash of light emitted as countless spirit stones, all of high quality, cascaded into the sea.</p><p>The sheer number of spirit stones stunned the Golden Core cultivators outside.  They finally understood why a single jade talisman was so expensive.  This was just the spirit stones; the cost of the materials used in the array must be astronomical.</p><p>Only the top-tier sects could possibly afford such an undertaking.</p><p>The spirit stones fell precisely onto the points of light in the sea.  Upon contact with the water, they were instantly absorbed and silently dissolved, while the points of light grew larger, rising like the sword summoned by the High Priestess, eventually transforming into swords.</p><p>The surrounding Nascent Soul cultivators moved simultaneously.</p><p>They each manipulated the light swords around them, forming streams of light that surged towards the center of the array. The speed and scale were incredibly impressive.</p><p>This was clearly no easy feat; all the Nascent Soul cultivators showed strain, some even using their magic treasures to assist.</p><p>The High Priestess' gaze sharpened as she looked at Lingzhuzi and Elder Fang.</p><p>The man and the cicada each emitted a green and yellow light respectively, connecting to the central light sword, seemingly supporting its ascent.</p><p>At the same time, streams of light shot towards the sword, merging seamlessly. The sword seemed bottomless, absorbing everything.</p><p>In an instant, the thousand swords fused into one, gathering the power of the entire array. The immense power was focused at a single point.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, positioned on the outermost edge, felt only a faint fraction of the power, yet it was enough to make their scalps tingle and their hearts pound with terror.</p><p>Lingzhuzi's expression was grave, his whisk trembling slightly as he connected it to the light sword.</p><p>Elder Fang spread his wings, vibrating them rapidly, producing a sharper cicada cry than before, irritating those who heard it.</p><p>The High Priestess, who was bearing the brunt of the effort in managing the Thousand Swords Array, had a calm yet determined expression; her lips were tightly pressed together as she continuously formed hand seals, sending countless incantations into the light sword.</p><p>Because of this, the light sword, though formed from a thousand swords, did not collapse but instead became increasingly solid.</p><p>Finally, a jade-white spiritual sword appeared above everyone.</p><p>The sword was about three feet long, translucent like jade, its body covered with runes, resembling an immortal sword.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The High Priestess suddenly pointed her jade hand at the immortal array. The spiritual sword trembled slightly, flashed, and plunged into the grey wind wall. After a brief silence, a terrifying, invisible wave erupted within the wall.</p><p>The cultivators' minds felt as though they had been struck by a heavy hammer; their escaping lights flickered.</p><p>The next moment, a familiar sight appeared: the grey wind wall began to crumble from the inside, countless cracks spreading outwards. Each crack seemed to contain a light sword, creating paths for the cultivators.</p><p>"Move!"</p><p>The High Priestess and Lingzhuzi shouted almost simultaneously.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators took out their jade talismans and instantly passed through the gaps, entering the wind wall.</p><p>Qin Sang, also prepared, immediately raised his talisman, chose a gap, and rushed in.  The power of his talisman was already activated before he even moved.</p><p>This time, it wasn't a bloody protective shield, but a light akin to a sword energy, enveloping him, carving a path through the storm. He quickly faced the first impact.</p><p>Qin Sang, having been through this before, calmly dealt with it. Under the protection of the talisman, he successfully resisted the impact of the immortal array, passed through it, and landed on the wasteland below.</p><p>The wasteland was exceptionally vast.</p><p>Qin Sang landed firmly on the ground.  Looking up, he saw figures falling from the sky after passing through the immortal array, each landing in a different location.</p><p>After a brief pause, they immediately sprang into action, soaring away in all directions, disappearing into the deep mountains and dense forests.</p><p>“They’re back!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, glancing towards the Sky Tower before turning and flying towards the Purple Mist Wasteland.  He decided to obtain the Nine Nether Magic Fire first.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the ancient forest bordering the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>He vividly remembered his first encounter with Xiang Yi here, knowing the forest was teeming with formidable insects and beasts. He prepared several types of powder, wearing them on his person.</p><p>With a muttered incantation, he became invisible and entered the forest to search for the Purple River.</p><p>Qin Sang moved cautiously, unsure if the East Pole Alliance would send more people to the Purple Mist Wasteland to activate the ancient divine platform, potentially causing further complications.</p><p>As Qin Sang swiftly flew towards the Purple Mist Wasteland…</p><p>Deep in the mountains, two groups of Yuan Ying cultivators were flying not far from each other, heading towards the Sky Tower.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo glanced towards the Purple Mist Wasteland, then surveyed the Yuan Ying cultivators around him, finding nothing amiss.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he secretly communicated something to the blood-robed elder beside him.</p><p>The blood-robed elder was startled. “Mou Lao Mo, you dare defy the orders of the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Lord! You’re courting death, don’t drag me down with you!”</p><p>“Heh heh, Old Blood, I know your secret! You want to use the Seven Killing Hall’s ancient prohibition to refine that evil object, to help you survive your next tribulation.  The success rate is probably less than 10%, isn't it? Without it, you probably won't live another hundred years.  Just help me this once, and I'll get Wen Lao Mo to lend you his Heavenly Gang Ring.”</p><p>Mou Lao Mo suppressed his anxiety, proposing a deal to the blood-robed elder.</p><p>The blood-robed elder’s expression shifted. He disbelieved, “The Heavenly Gang Ring is Wen Lao Mo’s most prized possession; you think he’ll just lend it out?”</p><p>“Wen Lao Mo owes me a great favor. Borrowing the Heavenly Gang Ring once is doable! While not as effective as your evil object, it's a rare treasure and could buy you a fighting chance.”</p><p>Mou Lao Mo was confident. “Besides, I'm not exactly disobeying orders. As long as you give it your all, there shouldn't be any major issues.”</p><p>The blood-robed elder showed clear interest, his eyes flickering.</p><p>“Fine! I’ll trust you this once! But if you dare deceive me, I won't hesitate to take revenge on you and your Sky Wind Island, even though my days are numbered!”</p>
