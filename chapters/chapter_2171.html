<h1>Chapter 2161</h1><p>Si Huang smiled upon hearing this.  "To be frank, Qin Zhenren, the treasures within the ancient temple are invaluable to our 異人族. Outsiders, however, would gain little benefit.  They must be refined within the ancestral temple, using its power."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. Outsiders couldn't enter the 異人族 ancestral temple; even forceful entry wouldn't gain its approval. He couldn't refine this treasure, and even if he could trade it, it would offend the Si You royal family, making it a losing proposition.</p><p>Si Huang's proposal was appealing. Qin Sang was genuinely interested in the treasure's origin, especially after discovering its hidden secrets, raising its value in his eyes.</p><p>If the treasure was connected to a certain legacy, that legacy must be significant, and worth investigating if the opportunity arose.</p><p>Helping Si Huang seize the treasure would be dangerous, but Qin Sang considered his escape techniques and strength to be sufficient.  With enough caution, he believed he could survive.</p><p>After considering this, Qin Sang said, "I cannot guarantee I will help you obtain the treasure, Daoist friend, but I will do my best."</p><p>"Thank you, Qin Zhenren!"</p><p>Si Huang rejoiced. The three immediately began strategizing.</p><p>While Si Huang had insisted Qin Sang wouldn't face mortal danger, once the fighting began, the situation might not unfold as planned. Qin Sang's proximity to the temple would inevitably attract the attention of all opponents. After opening the temple, it was impossible to predict their actions; they would have to improvise. Qin Sang couldn't simply turn and run.</p><p>The three quickly agreed on a plan, keeping the grey figures occupied while monitoring the radiant light and their opponents' movements.</p><p>The four winged beings were increasingly harassed by the grey figures, forced to retreat continuously.</p><p>Seeing a weaker Saint Winged being separate from its companions, Si Huang and Shaoshi exchanged glances, subtly approaching the isolated individual.</p><p>The other three winged experts, wanting to help their companion, also worried about missing the treasures within the secret realm, and were torn.</p><p>Realizing he was a liability, the isolated being immediately surrendered, allowing the radiant light to push him back.  The other three retreated to roughly the same distance as Si Huang, maintaining a standoff that prevented rash actions.</p><p>Si Huang, unable to pursue personally, secretly contacted the Crown Prince.</p><p>The Crown Prince and his two companions were already struggling to defend against both the radiant light and the grey figures, and couldn't effectively participate here, so they pursued the retreating Saint Winged being.</p><p>With the Crown Prince's departure, only six remained.  Qin Sang intentionally concealed his strength, lagging behind and appearing to struggle, thus making their side appear weaker.</p><p>"That Saint Winged being is the Dingyuan Marquis of the winged people; the other two are likely not winged people cultivators," said Si Huang.</p><p>Shaoshi also transmitted a warning, "They are intentionally concealing their identities, deliberately avoiding the use of their bloodline abilities during combat with the grey figures. A direct confrontation may be necessary to determine their origins, Qin Zhenren, be careful."</p><p>The legacy of each clan within the 異人族 differed greatly; without knowing their opponents’ identities, they could only improvise.</p><p>At that moment, Si Huang suddenly flew into a rage, shouting, "Nonsense!"</p><p>Dingyuan Marquis sneered, his expression full of sarcasm.  Clearly, they had been negotiating via secret transmission and the talks had broken down.</p><p>Despite neither side yielding, neither dared to initiate combat.</p><p>As time passed, the situation remained stagnant.  Just as both sides reached an impasse, the radiant light erupted again, even more intensely than before.</p><p>At the peak of the brilliant light's intensity, the grey figure before Qin Sang suddenly burst into a cloud of grey energy, then dissipated without a trace.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Si Huang softly commanded.</p><p>They had anticipated the grey figures' potential dissipation and had been waiting for this moment, acting without hesitation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strongest wave from the radiant light's eruption arrived. Dingyuan Marquis and his companions, caught off guard by the sudden disappearance of the grey figures and the light's eruption, cautiously prepared for the unexpected and hesitated to act.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others observed their opponents' hesitation—a golden opportunity!</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Si Huang and Shaoshi simultaneously lunged towards their opponents. Between the two figures, a mass of Xuanhuang light appeared, within which a scroll rapidly unfurled.</p><p>This time, Si Huang and Shaoshi jointly activated the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu.  The two top experts, understanding each other perfectly, were well-prepared.  Eight companion beasts plunged into the picture scroll, and the treasure immediately unleashed its formidable power.</p><p>Ignoring the radiant light’s assault, Si Huang and Shaoshi attacked with full force. The Xuanhuang light seemed to merge with the radiant light, transforming into landmasses in the void, complete with mountains and vegetation, blurring the line between reality and illusion.</p><p>This treasure, previously damaged during its attack on Qin Sang, now displayed even greater power, due not only to its two powerful operators.</p><p>As Si Huang made his move, a golden crown materialized above his head, transforming into a stream of light that vanished into the treasure map.  The map's power surged dramatically!</p><p>Instantly, Ding Yuan Hou and the others found themselves on a vast land, surrounded by magnificent mountains and rivers, lush vegetation.  The sky was filled with swirling, ochre clouds, mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>Then, an overwhelming pressure descended, inescapable from all sides. Every mountain, every river, every tree, every blade of grass seemed to be their enemy.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Simultaneously, as Si Huang attacked,  Qin Sang's back blazed with lightning.  His phoenix wings beat powerfully, abandoning his previous defensive stance. He didn’t join the battle, instead soaring towards the core of the realm, bathed in the radiant light.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the light from the realm's core was receding, but this didn't mean it was safe. Their deduction, based on traces in the lair, suggested the light might dissipate with the shadowy figures, but no one knew if it would undergo any unpredictable changes.  The risk remained substantial.</p><p>Bound by their agreement, Qin Sang couldn't retreat. A streak of green lightning shot upward, defying the powerful force of the light.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu.</p><p>Ding Yuan Hou and his companions wouldn't simply wait to be defeated.</p><p>Si Huang's timing was unexpected, but as seasoned warriors, they immediately realized he likely understood the patterns of the light.  Even with their vision obscured by the ochre clouds, they guessed he intended to attack the ancient temple!</p><p>One wrong move could ruin everything.  They had lost the initiative, but with a top expert added to their ranks, the situation was not hopeless.</p><p>A long howl shook the heavens.</p><p>The sea of clouds churned into a colossal wave of ochre.</p><p>A pure white light shot into the sky, revealing Ding Yuan Hou's figure.  Bathed in the light, he resembled a celestial being, untouched by the earthly realm, radiating sanctity, overlooking all creation from above.</p><p>His expression was serene, his arms outstretched in a prayerful gesture, a silent supplication to the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, his sacred wings fluttered, tracing an elegant arc across the sky.  His body and limbs moved with fluid grace, each movement imbued with power, harmonizing with a strange rhythm, natural and transcendent.</p><p>The Gan Qi Heavenly Dance!  One of the Yu Ren Clan's most powerful war dances, mastered by very few, even among the Sheng Yi Clan.</p><p>Ding Yuan Hou seemed to forget the unfavorable situation, forgetting the treasures within the temple, lost in his dance, pirouetting in the air.</p><p>He was now clad in armor—pure white, without a speck of color, its elegant curves enhancing his graceful movements.  It looked less like armor and more like a costume for his dance.</p><p>If Qin Sang had witnessed this, he would have been astonished, as Ding Yuan Hou's war dance bore a striking resemblance to the ritual dance performed by the Ghost Mother!</p><p>Both dances resonated with the heavens, their unique rhythms spreading through the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu.  Si Huang and Shao Shi, exerting all their effort on the treasure map, couldn't suppress the rhythm; instead, it disrupted their control.</p><p>“Rumbling…”</p><p>Mountains crumbled, rivers flowed backward, and countless plants turned to ash.</p><p>But Ding Yuan Hou alone couldn't break the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu.  One of his companions intervened.</p><p>Clad in black armor, his face was featureless, a shifting mass of dark mist.  Black clouds rose behind him, swirling into a pair of enormous black wings. The clouds seethed like burning flames.</p><p>The black-armored figure disappeared, leaving only the rapidly expanding black wings. Their powerful beating whipped up a tempest, shattering the earth and churning the clouds.</p><p>Soon, the sky was filled with a multitude of black crows, the entire sky obscured by the giant wings, making Ding Yuan Hou's dance even more striking.</p><p>With two top experts attacking with everything they had, even with their initial advantage, Si Huang and Shao Shi felt immense pressure.  Any lapse in their concentration, and they risked being overwhelmed and their efforts wasted.</p><p>This was precisely Ding Yuan Hou's goal: to completely tie up Si Huang and Shao Shi, preventing them from making any further moves.</p><p>The spectacle of their powers masked the movements of a third figure.  Clad in gray robes and a mask, he reappeared high above, amidst the black wings.</p><p>He looked up, his eyes gleaming strangely, then launched himself towards the ochre clouds.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, already shaking violently under the assault of Ding Yuan Hou and the black-armored warrior, was further battered.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi hovered on either side of the treasure map, eyes closed, remaining calm and collected, yet no longer daring to hold anything back.  They silently channeled their powers, and their eight companion beasts descended to the eight cardinal points of the Unstable Eight Extremes Map, transforming into eight beast-patterned celestial pillars that reached to the heavens.</p><p>The scene within the map immediately stabilized somewhat. A thick, heavy yellow cloud spontaneously appeared, descending heavily upon the third person!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi, both seasoned veterans, chose their moment perfectly.  The person was struck as if by lightning, trembling throughout their body. Even if not seriously injured, their assault would be fruitless.</p><p>At that moment, a strange change occurred. A mysterious light emanated from behind the person, within which a phantom figure seemed to appear.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Si Huang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ding Yuan Hou pushed his battle dance to its limit. A giant axe materialized between his hands, a brilliant white light, resembling a divine axe!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Ding Yuan Hou raised the axe high and swung it fiercely at the yellow cloud. A crescent-shaped white light cleaved through the void. Before this light, everything else paled in comparison.</p><p>Hei Yi also violently vibrated, a black peak rising up, striking almost simultaneously with the axe light, aiming for the same spot.</p><p>The figure behind the third person revealed itself—a being with a human body and the head of a bird, possessing three identical heads!</p><p>Six eyes blinked simultaneously. It was a Yang Shen , replacing the physical body, appearing ghost-like below the axe light.</p><p>Seeing this, Shao Shi's face also changed. He urgently warned Qin Sang, “Careful, it’s the Wu Yi tribe’s High Priest!”</p><p>The Wu Yi tribe’s abilities are extremely unique. Their essence belongs to the Spiritual Cultivation lineage, but they first refine their physical bodies, then nourish their primordial spirit with refined essence.  Later, upon achieving Yang Shen, their physical bodies gradually return to normal. However, the Wu Yi tribe has developed many strange physical cultivation techniques that make their true nature nearly indistinguishable.</p><p>The Unstable Eight Extremes Map is the treasured possession of the Si You imperial clan and contains methods to counter spiritual cultivation. However, physical and spiritual cultivation cannot be considered the same. Shao Shi and Si Huang mistakenly identified this person as a physical cultivator, leading to a fatal misstep.</p><p>Spiritual cultivation is the most unique of the three lineages.</p><p>In the three lineages of Spirit, Technique, and Body cultivation, the methods of cultivation differ, as do the paths pursued.</p><p>Technique cultivators gradually master the power of heaven and earth.</p><p>Body cultivators absorb heaven and earth to nourish their own inner world.</p><p>Spiritual cultivators actively integrate themselves with heaven and earth, pursuing the Dao .  Merging spirit with heaven and earth is the most elusive, appearing and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Of course, the path of cultivation has countless possibilities, with no fixed rules, but most cultivators from the three lineages choose these three mainstream paths, regardless of their race.</p><p>Therefore, spiritual cultivators are the most difficult to restrain.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The axe light and the black peak struck the yellow cloud in succession.</p><p>Si Huang had not exaggerated. Such powerful attacks still couldn't shatter the Unstable Eight Extremes Map, but for the Wu Yi tribe’s High Priest, the fissure created was enough to allow much to happen!</p><p>Almost as soon as Qin Sang received Shao Shi's warning, three bird heads emerged from the yellow cloud, scanning left and right before simultaneously fixing on Qin Sang with expressions of surprise and fury.</p><p>Qin Sang was approaching the core of the secret realm. A mere mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, yet fearless of the impact of the radiant light, he displayed an astonishing speed they hadn't anticipated.</p><p>Sensing the movement behind him, Qin Sang instinctively glanced back. Upon meeting the bird heads' gaze, his heart shook.</p><p>A strange light flashed in the eyes of the three bird heads.  Qin Sang stiffened, hearing piercing, strange laughter echoing in his ears. His eyes became vacant, and his escape light began to disperse.</p><p>Qin Sang had clearly fallen prey to the Wu Yi tribe High Priest's technique.  The methods of spiritual cultivation are incredibly mysterious and impossible to guard against. If he couldn't quickly escape, he would be flung out by the radiant light, his efforts wasted.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi were shocked, inwardly exclaiming their dismay.</p><p>The Wu Yi tribe High Priest secretly sneered. A mere mid-stage cultivator, even with some ability, could hardly withstand the Wu Yi tribe's Nightmare Soul technique!</p><p>Unfortunately, his triumph didn't last long.  A fierce struggle flared in Qin Sang's eyes, and he let out a roar, his expression and shout filled with pain, suggesting a considerable cost.</p><p>At the moment the radiant light was about to extinguish, he actually broke free from the Wu Yi tribe High Priest's Nightmare Soul technique!  To the astonishment of Si Huang and Shao Shi, the radiant light exploded, and Qin Sang, seizing the opportunity, charged towards the core of the secret realm, throwing a [word missing, possibly a type of magical artifact] in his hand.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The thunder seal manifested, its blue thunder illuminating the ancient hall!</p>
