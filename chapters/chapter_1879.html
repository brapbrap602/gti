<h1>Chapter 1870: A Glimpse</h1><p>Sandstorms swept across the battlefield.</p><p>The roar of battle ceased. Cultivators and demon cultivators stared blankly at the sky, faces filled with shock.</p><p>Boundless dark clouds surged from the southeast, turning day into night.  Golden light within the clouds captivated all eyes.</p><p>A figure, like a dragon, seemed to ride the clouds, approaching.  As the cultivators saw the golden light, the sky above the battlefield was already ablaze with golden霞.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>At that moment, both demon and human cultivators felt an overwhelming, terrifying power descend.</p><p>Weaker cultivators suffered from the immense pressure; their hearts pounded violently, some collapsing under the strain, their minds reeling, and blood spurting from their mouths.</p><p>Those who had formed battle formations joined forces to withstand the pressure, barely maintaining their composure.  Even so, their faces were pale, eyes filled with intense terror.</p><p>Among them were veterans who had long served on the Huangquan Path, seasoned warriors who had witnessed the awe-inspiring power of Grand Masters and Demon Kings clashing. Yet, this power far surpassed anything they had ever seen; the two were simply incomparable.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>“The Great Saint?”</p><p>…</p><p>The Daoist formations faltered; it was the hearts of the men that broke.</p><p>The Daoists and Guifang Kingdom were locked in endless conflict, their armies clashing on the Huangquan Path.  At most, Grand Masters and Demon Kings were deployed.</p><p>True Lords and Great Saints were known only by name, never seen.</p><p>All the cultivators understood: if a True Lord or Great Saint intervened personally, the situation would become irreversible.  The destruction of Jushan Prefecture would be but a thought away.</p><p>Before even glimpsing the Great Saint, the battlefield was in disarray. Yet, this overwhelming power wasn’t directed at them.</p><p>In an instant, the dark clouds swallowed the Jushan Prefecture altar, enveloping the multicolored auspicious clouds above it, dimming their radiance.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A golden ray shot down from the clouds.</p><p>…</p><p>Baishi Prefecture.</p><p>A mountain peak within the prefecture's altar.</p><p>This mountain was Baishi's highest peak, though hidden by the altar's great formation, invisible to ordinary eyes.</p><p>Unlike other areas, it lacked golden temples, possessing an extraordinary spiritual grace and tranquility, a natural beauty.</p><p>A grove of purple bamboo covered the summit, with several bamboo halls built within, their doors closed, the surroundings deserted.</p><p>As the drumbeat sounded, a door suddenly creaked open.</p><p>*Creak!*</p><p>No one emerged.</p><p>Within the hall, an incense burner burned fragrant incense. A figure, a female cultivator in moon-white Daoist robes, sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion. Her presence was faint, her face unveiled yet somehow shrouded in a strange mist.</p><p>People wouldn't find her exceptionally beautiful, nor ugly; they would forget her appearance instantly.</p><p>Her eyes were closed in meditation.</p><p>The drumbeat reached her ears.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered slightly, her expression unmoved.</p><p>A sigh echoed from within the bamboo hall. A red light shot out, streaking towards the Jushan Prefecture altar.</p><p>Its source was a thumb-sized brass bell, adorned with a red ribbon.</p><p>The bell's speed was no less than the Great Saint's, instantly traversing mountains and rivers.  Its presence was far less conspicuous, appearing to onlookers as merely a peculiar meteor.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhongmao Prefecture.</p><p>This prefecture’s altar layout differed greatly from Baishi’s.  Eight smaller arrays surrounded and connected to form a larger one, encompassing the various departments of the Tianshu Academy, guarding a central, not particularly tall, mountain peak.</p><p>Golden temples, resplendent, stood atop the mountain.</p><p>In the highest and most magnificent temple, a golden bell hung beside the entrance.</p><p>At that moment, the bell tolled, its sound echoing only within the temple's confines.</p><p>Spiritual energy gathered above the temple, forming a hazy figure, vaguely resembling a lean Daoist.</p><p>The Daoist stood with his hands behind his back, gazing north, his face thoughtful. He glanced towards Baishi Prefecture, raised his right index finger, and pointed towards the Jushan Prefecture altar.</p><p>The next moment, the Daoist's form gradually faded, disappearing completely, yet maintaining his posture unchanged.</p><p>…</p><p>Golden light descended from the heavens.</p><p>The light was blinding, revealing a section of a dragon's tail, its golden scales gleaming, whipping down from the sky.</p><p>The half-dragon body was clearly visible to all outside the altar.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds like an arrow, landing directly above the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons incomplete diagram.</p><p>Instantly, the clouds exploded; the earth trembled; even the cultivators and demon cultivators in the air struggled to maintain their balance, overwhelmed by the spectacle.</p><p>Above the altar, a section of a dragon's body pierced heaven and earth, its head unseen, its size unknown.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>As the Daoists were at a loss, the demon cultivators received their retreat order.  The Demon Kings acted swiftly; the situation was unfolding precisely as the Great Saint had planned.</p><p>Their mission was complete; the earlier display was merely a feint to convince the Daoist Court that the Divine Court had emerged.</p><p>They were no longer needed to seize the fragments of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, nor did they possess the ability to participate.</p><p>The order was given, and it was obeyed.</p><p>The demon cultivators retreated like a tide.</p><p>The Daoist forces were jolted awake, encountering such a situation for the first time, momentarily at a loss as to what to do. Then, a red light appeared, streaking in from the west.</p><p>‘Tingling…tingling…’</p><p>As the red light sped towards them, a brass bell gently swayed, emitting a clear, crisp sound.  The sound wasn't harsh, yet all the cultivators both inside and outside the altar heard it. The bell's tone held a calming power, soothing the turmoil in their minds.</p><p>The red light shot towards the altar, revealing its form above: a flowing ribbon danced in the wind, the brass bell now shaking violently.  Visible ripples spread from the bell’s mouth, forming yellow sound waves that seemed to distort the very fabric of space.</p><p>These sound waves moved towards the dragon’s body within the clouds.</p><p>At that moment, a persistent, high-pitched shriek arose from the depths of the Evil Origin, growing closer and closer.</p><p>Many cultivators, both human and demon, clutched their ears in pain. The shriek overwhelmed the bell's sound, piercing their minds.</p><p>The heavens grew darker.</p><p>Those with sharper senses noticed something amiss. They looked up, pointing towards the rear of the altar, trembling, "What is that?"</p><p>Those around them followed their gaze, falling silent in astonishment.</p><p>Under the gloomy sky, strange patterns appeared out of thin air, like intricate, layered ripples of water, radiating a black luster.</p><p>"That...looks like feathers?"</p><p>"Wings!"</p><p>"A wing! Only one!"</p><p>…</p><p>Gasps of astonishment echoed.</p><p>They finally saw it clearly: a monstrous beast's wing obscured the sky in that direction.</p><p>Monstrous beasts, as a rule, had at least two wings, except for some unusual creatures. Yet, from where they stood, even this single wing was incomplete, stretching beyond sight, let alone another one.</p><p>Suddenly, the heavens seemed to descend!</p><p>The cultivators staring in that direction involuntarily held their breath, an immense sense of oppression weighing on their hearts.</p><p>The sky hadn't fallen, but the wing had moved, seemingly slowly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A sudden gust of wind arose.</p><p>The wing's movement was as forceful as the dragon's tail.  The black feathers rustled, and a mass of black wind formed beneath the wing.</p><p>In an instant, this gust transformed into a hurricane, as vast as the wing itself, engulfing the brass bell and the sound waves.</p><p>The bell's sound immediately weakened.</p><p>Simultaneously,</p><p>In the northwest, deafening thunderclaps echoed.</p><p>In the east, dark clouds gathered.  In the north, black feathers blotted out the sky, while the western sky was filled with grey lightning.</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning, seemingly chaotic, aimed with unwavering precision at the altar.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The first grey lightning bolt, the thickest of them all, struck the void on the western side of the altar.</p><p>At that precise moment, starlight descended from the heavens.</p><p>It wasn't night, yet countless stars appeared high above.  Elsewhere, the starlight might have been dazzling, but here, it appeared unusually dim.</p><p>However, the Milky Way remained clearly visible within the starfield.</p><p>Stars in the Milky Way shone brightly, shooting a beam of starlight downwards.  Then, surrounding stars began to twinkle one by one.</p><p>Streams of starlight fell from the heavens, illuminating the battlefield, converging at the point where the first ray landed.</p><p>At this moment, countless stars shone only upon this place.</p><p>The starlight merged, transforming into a gentle jade-green color, before solidifying into a jade amulet.</p><p>The amulet was no more than three inches long, exquisitely crafted, a paragon of translucent jade.</p><p>Faint starlight flickered on the amulet's surface, indistinct because the runes were constantly shifting, seeming to encompass all the heavenly stars within.</p><p>The amulet trembled, about to shoot towards the altar, when the grey lightning struck.</p><p>‘Rumbling…’</p><p>The area around the amulet instantly became a grey sea of lightning.  Although the amulet couldn't be easily destroyed, it seemed trapped within a giant cage of lightning.</p><p>The demon's war drum couldn't control the attracted beast, but it could barely manipulate the beast's instincts, guiding it for a short time, nothing more.</p><p>However, in the Great Demon Saint's plan, this short time was enough!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds.</p><p>From above, one could see a deep hole appearing at the center of the auspicious clouds; the dragon's tail had already pierced through countless layers of illusion.</p><p>A blinding golden light shone from within, interspersed with other colored lights, and countless strange fragments, coalescing into a storm with terrifying destructive power, capable of tearing apart everything around it.</p><p>The Great Sage violently breached the ritual grounds, his dragon tail causing immediate chaos and triggering tumultuous illusions within the grounds.  The dragon tail was at the storm's epicenter.</p><p>The ensuing turmoil unleashed long-dormant ancient powers; even the mighty Sage dared not linger.</p><p>A golden scale, shimmering like a steadfast anchor, plunged relentlessly into the ritual grounds.</p><p>The grounds trembled violently.</p><p>From the storm's heart, chaotic waves, laced with golden light, erupted and spread across the entire grounds.  Every person present felt the terrifying shockwave.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren, still reeling from the roars of two monstrous beasts, were further stunned by this new development.  Though the storm hadn't yet reached them, its oppressive force was palpable.  Through the chaos, they glimpsed fragments of the unfolding events—a terrifying sight!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The dragon tail, unstoppable, pierced through layer upon layer of illusions.</p><p>At this point, the old Taoist priest guessed the true intentions of the Gui Fang nation.  He acted decisively, flinging his whisk upwards.</p><p>The whisk's filaments shot skyward, piercing the Xuanhuang energy above.</p><p>*Whoosh!* *Whoosh!*</p><p>The Xuanhuang energy surged back, frantically gathering towards the Heavenly Prison in the center.</p><p>“Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”</p><p>Activating the Heavenly Prison had been prepared for, the incantation swift.  Retrieving it, however, proved far more difficult.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying pressure above, the old Taoist priest's eyes bulged, the knuckles of his hand gripping the whisk cracking.</p><p>As the Xuanhuang energy contracted, the outline of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prison fragments gradually reappeared.</p><p>Suddenly, the Xuanhuang energy solidified, seemingly bound by some force.  The old Taoist priest felt his connection to the fragments weaken drastically, the control slipping away.  Panic seized him.</p><p>He flung out his sleeve, releasing dozens of talismans.  Explosions rang out as the talismans’ power surged towards the fragments.</p><p>He struggled desperately, unwilling to lose the treasure.  In a moment of crisis, he even considered snatching the Myriad Demon Drum.</p><p>However, Ruquan Zhenren and the others had assessed the situation.  Even at their peak, they wouldn't dare face the Great Sage directly. Now, having reduced their cultivation, they were vulnerable; a mere ripple of the Sage's power could obliterate them.</p><p>This was no longer a matter of self-sacrifice.  Even if everyone present gave their lives, they couldn't stop the Great Sage from seizing the fragments. Even if the old Taoist priest retrieved the fragments, escape was impossible; death awaited.  Their only hope rested on the timely intervention of a True Monarch to drive back the Great Sage.</p><p>“It's the Great Sage! We cannot fight! Retreat!”  Ruquan Zhenren shouted.</p><p>The three Grand Masters exerted all their might to redirect the ritual grounds, abandoning everything else to lead a hasty retreat.</p><p>The old Taoist priest finally came to his senses, gazing at the fragments with a complex expression.  He sighed, then ruthlessly put away his whisk.</p><p>With the core of the battle array resolute, their retreat sped up.</p><p>They hadn't gone far when a blinding golden light struck them.  Above, a large golden hole appeared, a dragon tail piercing through the illusions.</p><p>Baiyi Yaowang and the other demons, carrying the Myriad Demon Drum, were gathered together, their faces alight with fervent excitement as they stared at the dragon tail.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The dragon tail lashed out, a beam of golden light disintegrating the Xuanhuang energy, reducing it to a small fragment which the golden light then captured.  The dragon tail then swept up the fragment and the demons, ignoring the terrified Daoist cultivators, and vanished.</p><p>Though the Great Sage barely deigned to glance at them, the golden light's aftershock left the Daoist cultivators battered and broken.  Their desperate flight availed them nothing; the powerful force struck them, sending them sprawling, bleeding profusely.</p><p>The four Grand Masters, using every ounce of their strength, managed to protect the Daoist masters, but their soldiers suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>The dragon tail withdrew, but the golden hole remained, and the storm within the ritual grounds intensified. Unlike the previous eruption of golden light, the Great Sage had truly shaken the grounds’ foundations, shattering a balance maintained for years.</p><p>Starting from the point where the dragon tail had pierced through the illusions, the power of ancient divine abilities fueled the storm, spreading constantly, affecting more and more illusions, undermining their foundations, and causing greater chaos.  Tranquility was gone.</p><p>“No!” Zuo Zhenren, jolted from his stupor, cried out in alarm.  He hadn't witnessed it firsthand, but the signs were unmistakable.  The old Taoist priest and the others were in the heart of the chaos. If they couldn't escape, their survival was doubtful.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Zuo Zhenren, barely giving Qin Sang a word, rushed to their aid.  Qin Sang, however, remained behind, staring into the depths of the ritual grounds, his face grim.</p>
