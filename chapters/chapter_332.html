Chapter 325: The Exchange


A thousand-year-old elixir for three Soul-Guiding Herbs and nine Heavenly Corpse Talismans.
A fair trade?
“A thousand-year-old Blue Dew Orchid…”
Qin Sang’s voice rang out, followed by a flash of blue light from his fingertips.
The jade box couldn't conceal the Blue Dew Orchid's aura; a幽蓝 (deep blue) glow illuminated the area around Qin Sang for a few feet, like a dream.
In an instant, all eyes in the hall focused on Qin Sang, or rather, on the Blue Dew Orchid in his hand.
A thousand years old—a phrase that instantly captivated everyone's attention.
“The Blue Dew Orchid is the main ingredient in Cleansing Dew Pills. Cultivators practicing Wood-type techniques, when taking this pill, can refine their spiritual energy and overcome cultivation bottlenecks. This thousand-year-old Blue Dew Orchid’s effects are beyond description…”
Qin Sang noticed many people didn’t recognize the Blue Dew Orchid, so he quickly introduced it while the hall was quiet.
Toward the end, he paused, a sudden thought crossing his mind. He retracted his almost-spoken words, replacing them with a calm tone.
“I don’t cultivate Wood-type techniques, so this Blue Dew Orchid has been unused.  I happen to be interested in Soul-Guiding Herbs. Is there any cultivator willing to make a trade?”
Qin Sang had already decided to exchange the Blue Dew Orchid for three Soul-Guiding Herbs, regardless of profit or loss.  However, getting a better deal was always welcome.
As expected, the revelation of the Blue Dew Orchid’s effects sparked just as much excitement as the Soul-Guiding Herbs, even if only one-fifth of the cultivators in the hall practiced Wood-type techniques—a significant number.
Qin Sang’s gaze fell on several cultivators he had previously observed, hoping their desire for Soul-Guiding Herbs wasn't too intense.
It would be a huge loss if he couldn't exchange the Blue Dew Orchid for the herbs.
At this moment, someone unexpected spoke.
From the moment Qin Sang produced the Blue Dew Orchid, Gao Yi’s expression changed, his gaze fixed on it as if assessing its authenticity.
The characteristic star-like aura of a thousand-year-old Blue Dew Orchid was unmistakable.  Confirming its genuineness, Gao Yi suddenly said, “My friend, are you sure you want to exchange the Blue Dew Orchid for these three Soul-Guiding Herbs?”
Qin Sang looked at Gao Yi in surprise, not expecting the Blue Dew Orchid to attract his attention.
Cleansing Dew Pills were only effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators and couldn't improve the success rate of Golden Core advancement. Gao Yi, a False Core cultivator, didn’t need the Blue Dew Orchid himself.
Unless he was buying it for someone else.
Qin Sang was pleasantly surprised.
Undoubtedly, Gao Yi was the wealthiest cultivator in the hall. His interest meant the trade was almost certain.
Qin Sang nodded immediately. “If Commander Gao offers a reasonable price, I'll exchange it. I give my word.”
This answer left room for negotiation.
Qin Sang wasn't overly greedy. A thousand-year-old elixir could be exchanged for a complete, unused talisman treasure.
There was significant room for bargaining.
Gao Yi didn't dwell on the details, unconcerned about Qin Sang breaking his promise. After receiving confirmation, he immediately took out a talisman from his storage pouch, displaying it and announcing, “Gao participates in the bidding for the Soul-Guiding Herbs. This is a Gu Demon Ring talisman treasure, usable for both offense and defense, with countless applications. It still retains 70% of its power. For fairness, I ask fellow cultivators to witness this.”
Gao Yi then tossed the talisman treasure, letting it circle the front of the hall for others to examine before placing it gently on a tray.
Gao Yi’s actions were remarkably open, presenting a fair competition of financial resources, without relying on his cultivation or the influence of Yin Mountain Pass to pressure others—a move that was faultless.
Since the appearance of the Soul-Guiding Herbs, there had been many twists and turns. This was the first bid.
“A Mountain-Subduing Stele talisman treasure, upon activation, manifests a colossal stele, heavy as a thousand jun, unstoppable. It also retains 70% of its power and should slightly surpass Commander Gao's Gu Demon Ring.”
The red-clothed woman Qin Sang had noticed indeed desired the Soul-Guiding Herbs. With a delicate laugh, she displayed a talisman treasure, making her bid.
The others watched with flickering eyes, no one following up, all observing Gao Yi’s response.


Gao Yi remained calm and nodded serenely.  "Fellow Daoist is correct. My Gu Mo Ring is indeed inferior to your Zhen Shan Stele. I concede... Does any other Daoist wish to bid?"

"Shadowless Whip Talisman…"
"Starlight Divine Armor…"
"Third-Grade Qinglian…"

No one would have guessed that so many cultivators possessing talismans were gathered in this small hall.  Three rare talismans appeared one after another.

The onlookers were thrilled and amazed.

Only a few had the resources to compete, and the bidding wasn't fierce. Most deliberated for a long time before bidding.  Among these talismans, the Daoist's Third-Grade Qinglian was the finest.

Just as Qin Sang felt anxious, Gao Hui finally didn't disappoint him.

"Hun Tian Spear Talisman, offensive type, used only once."

Gao Hui put away the Gu Mo Ring and brought out another talisman, laughing self-deprecatingly.  "Gao has brought out his most treasured possessions. If any Daoist can offer a comparable talisman, Gao can only add spirit stones.  Fellow Daoists needn't worry about Gao showing favoritism. The owner of the Yin Hun Grass will make the final choice."

This Hun Tian Spear Talisman was practically as good as new.

After Gao Yi presented it, the woman in red and others gave up. No one continued to compete, eliminating the need for the Yin Hun Grass owner to choose.

This was the least contested auction so far, yet with its twists and turns and the appearance of such treasures, it left everyone exhilarated and feeling it was worth the trip.

Gao Hui placed the talisman on the tray, his hand not touching the Yin Hun Grass. He used his spiritual energy to guide the three jade boxes towards Qin Sang. Qin Sang cleverly caught them and tossed his Lan Lu Dan to Gao Yi.

Gao Yi opened the jade box, inspected it, nodded in satisfaction, and mused, "Fellow Daoist, if the Gu Mo Ring had secured the Yin Hun Grass, Gao would have given you an additional top-grade magical artifact.  The Hun Tian Spear's value isn't much different from the Lan Lu Dan.  Therefore… Gao will take charge of the auction's share. Also, I recall you previously bought a Luo Feng Vine.  Do you still need spirit wood?  I have a Dian Shui Wood here to compensate you.  What do you think?"

"I accept your offer, Commander Gao!"

Qin Sang bowed, accepting. The Dian Shui Wood was slightly less valuable than the Di Huo Pan Tong, but obtaining the Yin Hun Grass was more than enough; the spirit wood was a pleasant surprise.

After Gao Yi gave Qin Sang the Dian Shui Wood, the transaction was complete, and everyone was happy.

In full view of everyone, Qin Sang didn't keep the Yin Hun Grass for long. After verifying its authenticity, he put it away and continued to watch the auction.

With the Yin Hun Grass gone, probably only a few items remained.
