<h1>Chapter 1094: Return</h1><p>The Purple Palace.  </p><p>The ancient hall of the Sword Path.  </p><p>The long-dormant teleportation array suddenly flickered with a faint light.  </p><p>The glow shimmered.  </p><p>Not long after, a figure materialized out of thin air on the teleportation array, staggering slightly before steadying himself by gripping the stone pillar at the edge of the array.  </p><p>Qin Sang's face was pale. He shook his head and looked around at the familiar scenery, a wave of emotion washing over him.  </p><p>The ancient hall.  </p><p>The altar.  </p><p>The spirit array.  </p><p>After over a hundred years, he had finally returned.  </p><p>This time, he had experienced the teleportation process while fully conscious, and the sensation was far more vivid.  </p><p>Even with his current cultivation level, he still felt dizzy and disoriented, as if his body might be torn apart at any moment. The spatial impact and compression he endured during the teleportation were incomparable to the ancient teleportation array at the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.  </p><p>He silently circulated his cultivation technique, gradually recovering.  </p><p>His breathing steadied.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked down and noticed that the stone pillar he was holding was the very one left behind by Senior Qingzhu all those years ago.  </p><p>Seeing the two incomplete killing runes carved into it, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.  </p><p>Back then, Senior Qingzhu was still alive, but due to a twist of fate, the two of them had never met.  </p><p>When they finally did, it was only to part forever.  </p><p>Qin Sang gently rubbed the Thousand Jun Ring on his finger.  </p><p>Senior Qingzhu's remains were now inside the Thousand Jun Ring.  </p><p>In the Nether Valley, Qin Sang had discovered Senior Qingzhu's body seated beneath a peach tree, having passed away in meditation. Following Senior Qingzhu's final wishes, Qin Sang had crafted an ice coffin and brought the body back, intending to take it to the place mentioned in Senior Qingzhu's final poem.  </p><p>That place was Senior Qingzhu's hometown.  </p><p>It wasn't located within any immortal sect but, like Shaohua Mountain, was situated on the edge of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.  </p><p>After preparing the body, Qin Sang carefully set up protective formations around the peach tree in the Nether Valley to shield it from the corrosive influence of the Nether Qi.  </p><p>He hoped that the peach blossoms would never wither!  </p><p>Additionally, there was the final poem Senior Qingzhu had left on the cliff face, which was also a top-tier sword scripture, encapsulating Senior Qingzhu's lifelong insights into the Dao of the Sword and the Dao of Killing.  </p><p>For someone like Qin Sang, who cultivated the same technique as Senior Qingzhu, this scripture was nothing short of an invaluable treasure!  </p><p>Filled with gratitude, Qin Sang bowed respectfully to Senior Qingzhu, then carefully committed the sword scripture to memory and transcribed it into a jade slip. He also retrieved the fragment of the Killing Sword but left the cliff face untouched.  </p><p>These were the final traces Senior Qingzhu had left in the world.  </p><p>But Qin Sang would carry on Senior Qingzhu's legacy and continue forward.  </p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and the fragment of the Killing Sword appeared in his palm.  </p><p>Because the fragment bore a complete "Kill" character, Qin Sang referred to it as the Killing Sword.  </p><p>Looking down at the "Kill" character, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  </p><p>Although the sword was damaged, he could still sense an inexplicable divine aura emanating from the character, one that was hard to resist and even affected his mind.  </p><p>When intact, the Killing Sword must have been a treasure beyond the imagination of any cultivator in the world!  </p><p>When Qin Sang had first obtained the fragment, the sword spirit, in the form of a wisp of gray mist, had instantly entered the fragment.  </p><p>Recalling Senior Qingzhu's words, Qin Sang hadn't stopped it.  </p><p>Of course, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten Senior Qingzhu's warning. Until the sword spirit awakened, it was impossible to tell whether it was benevolent or malevolent. He needed to be prepared in case the sword spirit turned on him.  </p><p>However, after the sword spirit entered the fragment, Qin Sang began to regret his decision.  </p><p>When Senior Qingzhu was at the Core Formation stage, he had been able to barely wield the Killing Sword fragment, and it was thanks to this treasure that he had managed to severely injure Leng Qiantian after being discovered by him.  </p><p>But after the sword spirit merged with the fragment, Qin Sang found that activating the fragment now felt sluggish and cumbersome.  </p><p>This was undoubtedly related to the dormant sword spirit.  </p><p>It was unclear whether the sword spirit was unconsciously resisting or if it was using the sword's power to nourish itself.  </p><p>Now that the sword spirit had merged with the fragment, forcing it out would be difficult. After weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang decided to let the sword spirit remain, as he currently had no shortage of trump cards.  </p><p>With the sword spirit inside the fragment, its recovery would be much faster than if it were within his body. The sooner it awakened, the sooner it could help him locate other fragments and techniques.  </p><p>For now, Qin Sang kept the fragment within his dantian, nurturing it.  </p><p>He was deeply curious about the origins of the Killing Sword.  </p><p>The sword had shattered, and the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture" had also been torn apart. The fragments and the incomplete scripture were hidden in the same place, and cultivators who mastered the technique could wield the sword fragments, indicating how closely the two were connected.  </p><p>What would it be like when he obtained the complete technique and restored the Killing Sword to its former glory?  </p><p>"The Purple Palace, the Seven Slaughter Hall..."  </p><p>These two secret realms flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  </p><p>Qin Sang suspected that if the Seven Slaughter Hall had once been a peerless immortal sect, the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture" might have been the sect's true inheritance technique.  </p><p>The Heavenly Tower, the Yitian Peak, and the lingering sword intent at the end were all evidence of this.  </p><p>The Purple Palace was also intricately connected to them.  </p><p>The first part of the technique and the sword spirit had both been obtained in the Purple Palace.  </p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang suspected that these two secret realms might not be the only ones. There could be other fragments scattered across different immortal realms. If these realms were all surrounded by endless storms, finding them would be an immense challenge.  </p><p>The teleportation arrays in both places were linked.  </p><p>Once he reached the Nascent Soul stage, he would thoroughly explore them to search for clues.  </p><p>What most captivated Qin Sang's attention was undoubtedly the shadow of the immortal palace within the immortal restrictions of the Seven Slaughter Hall.  </p><p>Unlike the chaotic and lifeless Seven Slaughter Hall, the immortal palace appeared intact, exuding an ethereal aura that stirred the heart. Senior Qingzhu had only searched along the white jade corridor and had found a Minor Teleportation Talisman, a top-tier divine talisman that was now extinct in the world.  </p><p>One could only imagine the treasures hidden within those immortal palaces!  </p><p>He was the only cultivator who knew how to enter the immortal restrictions, but the white jade corridor didn't directly lead to the immortal palace. Further exploration would be required.  </p><p>After preparing Senior Qingzhu's remains, Qin Sang retraced his steps to the immortal restrictions and found the hidden path Senior Qingzhu had left on the white jade corridor. Using a talisman to clear the way, he located the ancient teleportation array within the restrictions.  </p><p>He had originally wanted to search for other paths within the restrictions, but after enduring the trials of the testing grounds and the battles at Yitian Peak, time was running out.  </p><p>The immortal restrictions were beginning to fluctuate.  </p><p>Soon, both the Seven Slaughter Hall and the Purple Palace would seal themselves.  </p><p>Leaving the Purple Palace didn't require the Minor North Star Array. When the Purple Palace sealed itself, the outer immortal formations would momentarily pause, and the vortex would briefly calm, providing the only opportunity for cultivators to leave.  </p><p>Before leaving, there were still a few things he needed to do.  </p><p>"How are you all?"  </p><p>Qin Sang sent a message to Bai.  </p><p>He adjusted his state.  </p><p>He didn't know what the situation in the Cold Domain had become, so he needed to be extremely cautious.  </p><p>If the ancient demon summoned by the Sin Abyss was as powerful as the Demon Lord suppressed beneath Yitian Peak, the Cold Domain and the Tianxing Alliance might already be in ruins.  </p><p>He could only retrieve the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, go into seclusion to cultivate, and wait for the Purple Palace to reopen before escaping back to the Canglang Sea.  </p><p>However, with the top experts of both the human and witch clans falling one after another, the Canglang Sea was likely no longer peaceful either.  </p><p>Qin Sang took out the token given to him by the descendant of the Four Saints Palace, lost in thought.  </p><p>The Southern Return Fairy had once mentioned that among the Four Saints, there was a cultivator at the Deity Transformation stage.  </p><p>Since the Four Saints Palace was a Deity Transformation lineage, forming a connection with them wasn't a bad thing.  </p><p>In the future, he would definitely pay them a visit, as they might help him unravel many mysteries.  </p><p>(Wishing everyone a Happy New Year!)</p>
