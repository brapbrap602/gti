<h1>Chapter 871: Orchid Island</h1><p>It's highly likely the shopkeeper was a Wu spy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he escaped, and there's no evidence.</p><p>The shopkeeper was only at the early Gold Core stage, and his heavy demonic aura suggested he'd forced a breakthrough using Demonic Augmentation Pills. He was unlikely to pose a significant threat.</p><p>For someone like that to provoke him was practically suicide.</p><p>Qinsang wasn't afraid of the shopkeeper, but he was worried about other spies in Tianxing City watching his cave.</p><p>After some thought, Qinsang decided against immediate action. Instead of retrieving his avatar, he rented a new cave nearby under the guise of "Daoist Qingfeng" to observe his old residence.</p><p>The cave appeared undisturbed, the protective formations intact.</p><p>Back in Tianxing City, within close proximity, Qinsang could communicate telepathically with his avatar.</p><p>The avatar hadn't detected any signs of surveillance either.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qinsang was contacting old friends, using various channels to gather information.</p><p>Three days passed.</p><p>Confident there was no ambush, Qinsang retrieved his avatar, continuing to monitor the old cave, hoping to use it as bait.</p><p>Unfortunately, his plan didn't work. No suspicious individuals appeared.</p><p>The shopkeeper had completely vanished.</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples and Wu spies likely realized the difficulty of assassinating a human Gold Core cultivator in Tianxing City and retreated.</p><p>This removed one problem for Qinsang, but also severed the lead.</p><p>Furthermore, Qinsang's information gathering wasn't going well. He couldn't identify the mysterious group. They were incredibly secretive and low-key, practically unknown.</p><p>"It seems I'll have to return to that sea region to find clues about their identity…"</p><p>Qinsang pondered in his new cave.</p><p>He knew that using this lead to target Black Serpent Mountain was almost impossible. If they had succeeded in their plan, they would have covered their tracks and fled.</p><p>His persistence stemmed from his interest in the lightning manipulation technique.</p><p>Qinsang still vividly remembered being engulfed by lightning. If he could master that technique, not only could he utilize stellar煞 energy, but he'd also gain a powerful new ability.</p><p>Revenge against Black Serpent Mountain was secondary.</p><p>He hadn't suffered any significant losses in the two confrontations. On the contrary, he had killed two of their Gold Core cultivators, inflicting heavy casualties. It was Black Serpent Mountain who should be furious.</p><p>Of course, Qinsang wasn't one to wait for revenge to come knocking. He would make Black Serpent Mountain pay. If he couldn't find the lightning technique, perhaps he could obtain it from Black Serpent Mountain cultivators.</p><p>However, with the ongoing turmoil in the Demonic Sea, he couldn't just invade the Wu Divine Continent.</p><p>"Before I leave, I need to settle my avatar."</p><p>Qinsang muttered, glancing at his avatar meditating nearby.</p><p>Thanks to blood nourishment, his avatar's cultivation speed was astonishing.</p><p>After the formation of the nascent soul, within just a few months, it had broken through several levels and was now at the sixth level of Qi Refinement, surpassing his original body's cultivation.</p><p>This was why Qinsang had gone to such lengths to create the avatar.  If all went well, its power would meet the requirements before the next Seven Kills Palace opening.</p><p>His avatar's Foundation Establishment required Qinsang to perform a secret technique, which could only be used when the avatar reached the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement, with its spiritual energy at its peak.</p><p>However, at this rate, it wouldn't take long as long as it had a safe cultivation environment.</p><p>"Tianxing City isn't safe. I'll take him to Orchid Island. After returning from there, I'll go to Orchid Island to investigate the Orchid Sect's stellar cultivation technique, which might take some time. Having my avatar nearby will allow me to provide blood nourishment regularly. There's a market on Orchid Island, so there must be decent caves…"</p><p>Qinsang made his decision.</p><p>With the Wu spies remaining hidden, he decided to leave.  After circling the city and confirming he wasn't being followed, he departed with his avatar.</p><p>Before leaving, aiming to disrupt Black Serpent Mountain's operations, Qinsang spread rumors of Wu infiltration and massacres of human cultivators. Whether this would have a significant impact, he didn't know.</p><p>…</p><p>The Orchid Sect was located north of Tianxing Island.</p><p>Their island was called Orchid Island, a name that clearly indicated their dominance as the undisputed power there.</p><p>However, Orchid Island was vast and couldn't be entirely occupied by the Orchid Sect.  Several other sects and factions existed, but their strength paled in comparison, forcing them to submit to the Orchid Sect's authority.</p><p>Over time, the situation had shifted.</p><p>The Orchid Sect once held immense power and influence, boasting multiple Nascent Soul ancestors. For unknown reasons, they had gradually declined, now supported by only two Nascent Soul cultivators, one being the sect leader.</p><p>The sect leader's lifespan was nearing a thousand years, yet he remained at the early Nascent Soul stage.  His next heavenly tribulation was imminent, and his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul cultivator was shrouded in mystery.  Years ago, rumors spread of them being gravely injured, and they had vanished since, possibly deceased.</p><p>There were no prominent figures among the younger generation either.</p><p>While the Orchid Sect remained a dominant force, its decline seemed inevitable.  The other sects and factions on Orchid Island were growing restless, with external forces likely influencing them.</p><p>Traveling cautiously with his avatar, Qinsang took a month and a half to reach Orchid Island.</p><p>Along the way, they posed as master and disciple, a convincing disguise.</p><p>"The Orchid Sect's main gate is located in the largest mountain range on Orchid Island. There's a large market nearby, established by the sect.  I plan to target their cultivation techniques. While I won't resort to outright robbery, to be safe, it's best to keep him further away…"</p><p>After some consideration, Qinsang inquired about the island's geography with a local cultivator and selected a suitable location. He traveled with his avatar for half a day, arriving at a picturesque green mountain.</p><p>To avoid attention, Qinsang activated the Spirit Concealment Technique, suppressing his cultivation to the late Foundation Establishment stage.  Unless someone possessed far superior cultivation or special detection treasures, they wouldn't see through his disguise.</p><p>He retrieved his usual flying artifact, the Nether Cloud, and flew with his avatar to the mountain. They landed discreetly nearby and ascended on foot.</p><p>Without using his Skyeye Butterfly, Qinsang immediately recognized the mist surrounding the summit as an illusionary formation.  He followed the only path, easily entering.</p><p>The market's size was second only to the one established by the Orchid Sect, jointly operated by several other factions on the island.</p><p>After exploring the market, Qinsang noted its orderly atmosphere. Cultivators behaved themselves within its confines, refraining from causing trouble. He nodded approvingly and rented a cave dwelling.</p><p>The cave wasn't as luxurious as the one on Bao Gu Mountain, but his avatar's current cultivation level didn't require high spiritual energy density.  It was more than sufficient.</p>
