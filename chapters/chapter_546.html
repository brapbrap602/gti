Chapter 539: High-Grade Spirit Stones!


This was far beyond Qin Sang's expectations.
He had assumed the Ten Yama Banners were Patriarch Kui Yin's lifebound treasure, but they weren't.
The "Ancient Yin Sha Manual" contained no method for refining the Ten Yama Banners.
Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense from the jade slip, pondered for a moment, then suddenly remembered something. His gaze swept over the items before him, and he picked up a transparent fragment that resembled a diamond.
After studying the "Ancient Yin Sha Manual", Qin Sang recognized this fragment as a piece of the Yin Thunder Bead, Jiu Pao's lifebound treasure, which had been shattered by the self-detonation of the Yuan Zhao Sect's leader.
"So tragic..."
Qin Sang shook his head, feeling sorry for Jiu Pao.
Not only was the Yin Thunder Bead shattered, but only a fingernail-sized piece remained, almost completely destroyed.  No wonder he had been unable to repair his lifebound treasure; it was practically the same as refining a new one.
Qin Sang examined it briefly before tossing the fragment aside. He lacked the ability to gather so many precious spirit materials to repair the Yin Thunder Bead.
Even if he could, he wouldn't.
Another person's lifebound treasure is difficult to truly master. Its power will always be slightly diminished, making it less effective than refining a new one. Moreover, the Yin Thunder Bead works best when used in conjunction with the "Ancient Yin Sha Manual" to maximize its power.
Used by others, its power would be further weakened.
Putting down the "Ancient Yin Sha Manual", Qin Sang tirelessly examined each jade slip, but still couldn't find the refining method for the Ten Yama Banners.
Qin Sang frowned slightly.
Patriarch Kui Yin must have passed down the secret method, otherwise Jiu Pao wouldn't have been able to repair the Ten Yama Banners.
Despite its long history, the Kui Yin Sect had been unable to complete the set of ten banners since Patriarch Kui Yin's death, likely because they couldn't find the Nine Nether Devil Fire.
"Huh?"
Qin Sang suddenly noticed a dark, iron-like object. Intrigued, he pulled it closer and discovered it was made of the same material as the banner poles of the Ten Yama Banners!
This piece of dark metal was quite large, a regular cylindrical shape, half a man's height and wide enough to embrace.  If used to refine banner poles, it could probably produce more than a dozen.
Actually, calling it dark metal wasn't quite accurate. Its material was neither iron nor stone, quite peculiar, unlike anything Qin Sang had seen before.
Moreover, the dark metal cylinder's shape was too regular to be naturally formed. It looked artificially refined.
Having navigated the cultivation world for so many years, he was no longer the naive young cultivator he once was, yet he had never heard of a similar material.
Qin Sang tried using his true essence to melt it, but it didn't leave a single mark.
However, when he took out the Ten Yama Banners and used the Nine Nether Devil Fire, he was surprised to find that the fire seemed afraid of the dark metal cylinder, shrinking back hesitantly.
Seeing this, Qin Sang was certain that the banner poles of the Ten Yama Banners were made from a similar material!
Then what about the banner cloths?
Qin Sang immediately began searching extensively, but found nothing similar.
"It seems I can only study it slowly when I have more time. However, this dark metal cylinder is definitely not ordinary. Once I figure out what it is, I might be able to refine a unique magical treasure. Jiu Pao's notes on the Yin Xuan Pagoda in the "Ancient Yin Sha Manual" seem to partially relate to this dark metal cylinder. Could he have planned to use it to refine the pagoda? Unfortunately, there are only a few sentences, with no mention of how to melt it..." Qin Sang mused.
He reminded himself to be careful when using the Ten Yama Banners, so as not to destroy this one.
Jiu Pao's possessions were meager.  Apart from this dark metal cylinder, there were no other treasures that surprised Qin Sang. The items Jiu Pao had taken were all gone, leaving only a pile of jade slips.
It seemed that gathering healing spirit medicines and establishing the Demonic Flame Sect had depleted his resources.
Now, there were still many various healing pills in the iron ring, which Qin Sang carefully sorted and stored. He also found two talisman treasures.
Qin Sang no longer held talisman treasures in high regard.  The two magical treasures and the Ten Yama Formation in his possession were far more powerful. Nevertheless, he carefully stored them away.
Then, he opened his storage pouch and transferred everything into the iron ring.
Finally, a pile of spirit stones remained on the ground.
Qin Sang's divine sense swept over them. His expression suddenly changed, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.  With a wave of his hand, he pulled four spirit stones from the pile: one dark yellow, one wood-green, and two crimson!
All four spirit stones had sealing restrictions on them.
Qin Sang somewhat eagerly picked up one of the crimson spirit stones and carefully opened a crack in the restriction. Immediately, a surge of incredibly pure, astonishing spiritual energy rushed out.
Qin Sang took a deep breath, a look of intoxication on his face, and couldn't help but exclaim, "This is a high-grade spirit stone!"
After so many years in the cultivation world, Qin Sang had finally seen a high-grade spirit stone with his own eyes.
According to common practice in the cultivation world, one high-grade spirit stone could be exchanged for a hundred mid-grade spirit stones, but trying to actually make such an exchange was nothing short of a fool's errand!
Top-grade spirit stones were even more legendary, considered rare treasures even in the ancient cultivation world.
In the current Small Cold Realm cultivation world, spirit stone mines containing high-grade spirit stones had long been exhausted. It was said that such pure spiritual energy was easily detectable and couldn't be hidden underground without sealing restrictions.
If it weren't for the occasional discovery of new secret realms in ancient battlefields, where a few high-grade spirit stones might be unearthed with luck, they would be even rarer now.
Even these weren't enough, and they were mostly divided among the major sects, rarely circulating among individuals.
This was because many powerful spirit arrays and restrictions, especially ancient formations discovered in those secret realms, required high-grade spirit stones. Without high-grade or top-grade spirit stones, even the most powerful spirit arrays and restrictions were useless.
Furthermore, using high-grade spirit stones during battles allowed for faster recovery, potentially providing an advantage that could turn the tide of a fight.
"I knew that old ghost Jiu Pao wouldn't have such meager loot after taking the Kui Yin Sect's treasures!" Qin Sang's face was full of excitement as he played with the four high-grade spirit stones.
The Kui Yin Sect had only been established for a few hundred years, and Patriarch Kui Yin's legacy hadn't been completely depleted yet, so it wasn't surprising that there were high-grade spirit stones.
"No wonder that old ghost, even with damaged treasures and serious injuries, was still so powerful, nearly destroying the Flying Night Devil. So he had high-grade spirit stones!  The final explosion was probably also powered by them.  But..."
Qin Sang muttered to himself, puzzled, "Why didn't he use these four high-grade spirit stones to buy healing pills? Was he afraid of exposing his identity and treasures?"
Qin Sang shook his head, unable to understand Jiu Pao's reasoning.  It was also possible that there were originally more than four, and some had already been used to purchase pills.
After admiring them for a while, Qin Sang carefully put them away.
Cultivating with high-grade spirit stones would certainly be faster, but it would be too wasteful.
For now, he couldn't think of any other use for them besides rapid recovery during battles, but such treasures were definitely good to have.
