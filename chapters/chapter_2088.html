<h1>Chapter 2079: The Golden Toad King</h1><p>“Master Zhenjun’s keen eyes have discerned so much, even though the array’s foundation is incomplete. I am truly impressed.  I’ve had this idea since achieving the Transcendence stage, and working with Junior Brother Shen to design this array has been extremely demanding. We frequently sought guidance from Fairy Liuli, humbly asking for her assistance.  She even helped us with the most crucial parts of the array, contributing immensely. We are deeply indebted to her.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed towards the north, his tone sincere.</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao showed an envious expression.  “A glimpse reveals the whole picture. Once complete, this will be the greatest protective mountain array in the Storm World!  I never expected such remarkable skill from Abbot Li, such profound mastery of array restrictions.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu humbly replied, “Master Zhenjun flatters me. My understanding is limited, and this array has many flaws.  I’ve racked my brains and resorted to crude methods, patching it up to barely maintain its structure. I intend to improve it gradually later. If your sect wishes to refine a new protective mountain array, or if the Three Teach Alliance collaborated, the result would surely surpass this.  Were this not my sect's protective array, I would have certainly sought your guidance.”</p><p>As a sect’s protective array, it’s natural to avoid outside involvement. This is only reasonable.</p><p>He sighed again, “The Qingyang Sect is still young, and even though we know the task is incredibly difficult, we must do this to provide a place for our future disciples.”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao chuckled, not detecting anything unusual; Li Yu Fu’s explanation seemed perfectly plausible to him.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect already has the appearance of a major sect, with countless disciples. Luye is overcrowded, and the other subsidiary temples cannot accommodate many more. Moreover, having the disciples scattered across different locations leaves them unsettled and hinders unity.</p><p>With the situation gradually improving, Qingyang Sect's decision to establish a new mountain gate, while seemingly sudden, is perfectly justified.</p><p>He had indeed been surprised by the scale of the array, not expecting such a grand project from Qingyang Sect. But on second thought, only a small portion of the foundation had been laid, so extrapolating from this was bound to be inaccurate.</p><p>A large-scale spiritual array doesn't automatically mean it's refined; it might simply be packed with everything to maximize power. It might be as Li Yu Fu suggested: an unwieldy array once completed.</p><p>Of course, Fairy Liuli also participated in the design, so Zhenjun He Gao hesitated to reach a conclusion. Together with Li Yu Fu, he slowly flew towards the palace, his eyes constantly scanning the ground, searching for clues.</p><p>This is the preparation phase; Qingyang Sect still allows outsiders like them in;  this won't last.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao noticed something else.  “This layout…Abbot Li seems to be dividing the entire array into smaller sub-arrays, which are then integrated?”</p><p>“You have incredibly sharp eyes, Master Zhenjun,” Li Yu Fu admired. “That is exactly my intention.  What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao stroked his beard.  “Every spiritual array can be divided; at its core, any spiritual array is created through division and unification. But Abbot Li seems to have divided the array too finely. So many sub-arrays… hmm…”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao fell silent for a moment, mentally calculating, then shook his head slightly.  “This approach simplifies the initial stages.  However, the integration stage will be exponentially more difficult. Unless Fairy Liuli personally intervenes… Abbot Li, what is your plan?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu answered calmly, “Fairy Liuli is a pillar of our world; we wouldn’t dare disturb her seclusion for such a minor matter.  I don’t have a clever plan. At the final stage, we will mobilize the entire sect, with each disciple overseeing a sub-array, allowing them to comprehend their section beforehand. With united efforts, we will overcome this challenge!”</p><p>“That…”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao hesitated. Without a complete picture of the array, he couldn't judge its feasibility.  Since Li Yu Fu dared to proceed, he must have some confidence.</p><p>However…</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao frowned.  “If you do this, your sect will be hard-pressed to focus on anything else, and this process will likely take a considerable time.”</p><p>“Correct,” Li Yu Fu nodded. “I planned to visit and discuss something with the Three Teach Alliance soon. Since I have the chance today, I'd like to hear your opinion first.”</p><p>Zhenjun He Gao had already guessed the matter.  He calmly responded, “Abbot Li, please proceed.”</p><p>They had just flown near the palace.</p><p>Li Yu Fu instructed his disciples to attend to the spirit cranes carrying the palanquin, then invited Master He Gao to enter the hall and be seated.  He began, "In the past few years, we've launched several counter-offensives.  Do you believe we've gained any real benefit, Master?"</p><p>Master He Gao pondered, "Aside from dampening the Changyou's arrogance, disrupting their plans, and achieving temporary stability, I don't see any substantial gains.  The territories we recapture are soon lost again."</p><p>"Precisely!" Li Yu Fu nodded.  "Some incessantly advocate for further counter-attacks, but I believe it's counterproductive.  Fairy Liuli is in seclusion and mustn't be disturbed. The Changyou forces occupy the Western Wastelands, but it seems to be mere harassment; they show no desire for a full-scale invasion.  We should use this opportunity to recuperate, build our strength, and avoid provoking them."</p><p>Master He Gao fell into thought. He understood Li Yu Fu's self-interest: only by avoiding a major war with the Changyou could the Qingyang Temple recall its disciples and have ample time to strengthen its mountain-protecting formations.</p><p>He had anticipated this, but Li Yu Fu's words revealed another piece of information.  Since the last struggle for the Qingling Energy, Fairy Liuli had been in seclusion, but the reason remained undisclosed.</p><p>From Li Yu Fu's tone, it seemed that even a full-scale war wouldn't easily force her out of seclusion. What could be so important?</p><p>Rumors circulated that Fairy Liuli had single-handedly intercepted the Changyou leader, sustaining serious injuries. But Master He Gao had observed nothing unusual about her after the battle, wondering if she was simply concealing her condition masterfully.</p><p>"Is the rumor true that Fairy Liuli's seclusion is aimed at breaking through to the Transcendent Void Realm?" Master He Gao asked directly.</p><p>"I don't know the source of that rumor," Li Yu Fu shook his head slightly. "Even Palace Master Tong isn't sure about Fairy Liuli's current cultivation level.  Reaching the Transcendent Void Realm is certainly not an easy feat."</p><p>"In my opinion," Li Yu Fu continued, "unless the Changyou invade our heartland, we needn't worry.  The Qingling Energy is the key. Our best course of action is to conserve our strength and focus on seizing enough Qingling Energy! Once someone breaks through to the Transcendent Void Realm, we can resolve the external threat once and for all!"</p><p>Seeing Master He Gao's silence, Li Yu Fu added calmly, "Have you noticed that the Changyou leader hasn't been heard from since the last battle?"</p><p>Master He Gao's expression changed subtly, but quickly returned to normal.  After a major battle, it's quite normal for the Changyou leader to enter seclusion to refine the Qingling Energy; it’s unwise to assume he’s on the verge of a breakthrough.</p><p>Even the Metamorphosis God stage is incredibly difficult. Without the Qingling Energy, countless cultivators would have long since perished.  The Transcendent Void Realm is even more challenging.</p><p>The Changyou are not a powerful clan; they are isolated and have limited resources, making it unlikely they possess potent elixirs. Being trapped at a bottleneck for centuries is quite common.</p><p>Just as he was contemplating this, Master He Gao and Li Yu Fu simultaneously looked towards the entrance hall, sensing a powerful aura approaching.</p><p>"Another distinguished guest arrives," Li Yu Fu bowed, "Please excuse me, Master." He went out to greet the visitor.</p><p>The guest arrived from the west.  Crimson clouds filled the sky, as if bathing the heavens in a golden glow.  A man in golden robes appeared, breaking through the air.</p><p>The man, with round eyes and a wide mouth, was slightly short and stout but possessed an imposing air and regal bearing. His golden robes were adorned with swirling, speckled patterns forming strange designs, yet his dignity remained unaffected.</p><p>Li Yu Fu's pupils constricted slightly at the sight of him, and he bowed respectfully from afar. "I did not expect the arrival of the Golden Toad King; my apologies for not having met you at the gate."</p><p>The newcomer was indeed the king of the Golden Toad Clan of the Yao Sea.</p><p>The Yao Sea tribes differed from the Eastern Sea tribes. Their kings were simply addressed as “King,” not “Great Sage” or “Saint King” by outsiders.  To them, the title of King denoted supreme status.  Even the great clans would accord the same respectful title to the rulers of smaller clans.</p><p>The Yao Sea tribes once included the dragons, phoenixes, and golden toads as their strongest members.  The Phoenix King perished during his Metamorphosis God tribulation, leaving no successor. The Phoenix clan declined afterward and while still strong, it paled in comparison to the rapidly rising strength of the Dragon and Golden Toad clans.</p><p>The Golden Toad King's strength was slightly inferior to the Dragon King's, but he remained a formidable force.</p><p>"Haha, I came uninvited.  I hope you don't mind, Master Li,"</p><p>The Golden Toad King's laughter boomed like thunder, causing the Qingyang Temple disciples to feel their blood surge. They looked up, but could only see the golden glow in the sky.</p><p>The laughter soon subsided as the Golden Toad King landed before Li Yu Fu, returning the bow. He then uttered a soft exclamation, noticing Master He Gao emerging from the palace.</p><p>His eyes flickered, and he bowed again.  "Unexpectedly, Master He Gao is also here."</p><p>"I only arrived a short while ago, and the tea is still warm.  Why would King Jinchan have leisure for a trip?"  Master Hegao curiously asked.</p><p>King Jinchan didn't hide it, casually replying, "I've recently been cultivating, and have been fortunate enough to have a breakthrough in understanding. I feel I'm about to overcome a major obstacle, but I lack a certain herb. I remember the Dragon Whale Sage King has it, so I came to request it.  Hearing that Qingyang Temple had rebuilt its gates, I decided to offer my congratulations along the way."</p><p>Hearing this, Li Yufa and Master Hegao were both startled.</p><p>After carefully observing King Jinchan, the two exchanged a silent glance, and then relaxed. King Jinchan was still some distance from breaking through to the late Transcendence stage.</p><p>The emergence of a late Transcendence stage demon in the Storm World is good for the world as a whole, but not necessarily for humanity. Humans lack advanced cultivation techniques, while demons continue to improve, their power growing stronger. But because the external threats remain, humans cannot restrain the demons, and can only watch them grow.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Sage King and the Jiao Dragon King are more powerful than King Jinchan. If even King Jinchan can break through, there's a strong possibility of three late Transcendence stage demons appearing.  And humanity currently only has Lady Liuli.  A one-on-three situation would completely reverse the power balance between humans and demons!</p><p>"My two friends, please come inside," Li Yufa invited.</p><p>"Not yet!"</p><p>King Jinchan waved his hand, gazing downwards, scanning the ground, before his eyes flashed brightly. "What a magnificent array!"</p><p>Master Hegao smiled slightly. "I once said that once this array is complete, it will be the greatest protective array in the world.  King Jinchan, do you agree?"</p><p>King Jinchan said, "Our demons' understanding of array formations is far less than that of humans.  Master, your insight is sharp; it must be true."</p><p>"You're too modest," Master Hegao shook his head, looking at Li Yufa. "Since we've met, why not ask King Jinchan for his opinion?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>King Jinchan looked at both of them. "I wonder what the two of you were discussing earlier?"</p><p>The three returned to the palace. Li Yufa ordered more tea to be served and repeated their earlier conversation.</p><p>King Jinchan didn't state his position directly. "Rest and recuperation, reducing casualties among our people, is a good thing. However, I alone cannot decide. I need to ask the Jiao Dragon King and the Dragon Whale Sage King for their opinions."</p><p>Master Hegao sipped his tea, a fleeting gleam in his eyes.</p><p>The most famous demon kings in the Storm World include the North Sea Feather King, whose cultivation is inferior to these three, but who is still the king of a region's demons, with numerous powerful subordinates, and a strong force.</p><p>King Jinchan didn't mention the Feather King, but specifically singled out the Dragon Whale Sage King, was he deliberately showing closeness to him?</p><p>In fact, the Dragon Whale Sage King is not close to the demons of the Demon Sea, but is closer to the humans of Central State, as they have been neighbors for a long time and know each other well.</p><p>But one can only see the surface, not the heart.  Who knows if the Dragon Whale Sage King has other plans?</p><p>Master Hegao sighed at the complexity of the situation, finding it increasingly difficult.</p><p>In the past, facing a common enemy, everyone was in the same boat, and in the face of life and death, they naturally cooperated, and other contradictions were suppressed. Now that the situation has improved slightly, various problems have begun to emerge.</p><p>The three of them couldn't reach a conclusion. Li Yufa's goal was also to spread the word through them.</p><p>Master Hegao finished a cup of tea and rose to leave. "If Master Li needs anything, just send a letter, and I will have people help you prepare it."</p><p>King Jinchan also said generously, "I also have some resources, Master Li, please don't be polite!"</p><p>"I thank you both," Li Yufa certainly wouldn't take their words literally. Their resources are not easy to obtain.</p><p>Master Hegao looked at King Jinchan. "King Jinchan, won't you travel with me?"</p><p>King Jinchan chuckled. "I'm curious about Qingyang Temple's array, and want to observe it for a few more days, but I'm afraid Master Li won't welcome it."</p><p>Li Yufa was surprised, but kept a calm expression. "How could that be! I would be honored, and want to ask King Jinchan about any flaws or omissions in the array."</p><p>"Haha, then I won't be polite…"</p><p>King Jinchan was true to his word. After seeing Master Hegao off, he informed Li Yufa and then flew to the ground, unceremoniously examining the array, even observing the Qingyang Temple disciples at work.  The array wasn't yet fully active, so he couldn't glean any secrets.</p><p>Li Yufa stood with his hands behind his back in front of the palace, watching King Jinchan appear here and there, secretly thinking, "This fellow is extremely attentive…"</p><p>King Jinchan acted openly, seemingly only out of curiosity, without any ulterior motives.</p><p>Thinking of his master who was in the mountains, Li Yufa felt no anxiety. He quietly watched King Jinchan's actions.</p>
