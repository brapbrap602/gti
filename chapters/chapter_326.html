<h1>Chapter 319 Earthfire Pan-tong</h1><p>Qin Sang sat in the sand for a long time, lost in thought.  He finally stood, brushing the dust from his clothes. The wistful look in his eyes was replaced by calm.</p><p>The young man in warrior's garb lay on the ground. Qin Sang had given him a healing elixir, and his wounds had closed, but his energy center and meridians were still sealed.  Qin Sang roused him and continued to cast the Soul Snatching Curse.</p><p>He learned that the two men were rogue cultivators roaming the Ancient Battlefield, with only a casual acquaintance with Yu Daiyue.  They had no powerful backing. Qin Sang’s concerns were eased.</p><p>The warrior wasn’t as resolute as Yu Daiyue. He wept and pleaded for mercy.  Qin Sang ignored him.</p><p>As the warrior watched in horror, Qin Sang, following the secret method from the Celestial Yin Corpse Manual, first sealed his spirit, then branded him with countless corpse-refining restrictions, turning him into a living corpse embryo. He then placed the body into the Corpse Puppet Sack.</p><p>He just needed to acquire the Soul Guiding Herb, and then he could use this man as a test subject to refine his first living corpse.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang retrieved the scarred man's body. After some effort, he refined him into a Malignant Corpse and stored it away to slowly cultivate.</p><p>Once finished, Qin Sang realized that the Earthly Yin energy and Five Elements Yin objects he had brought with him were almost depleted.</p><p>Refining a living corpse was many times more difficult and resource-intensive than a malignant corpse, and he wasn't sure if the remaining materials would suffice.</p><p>The Five Elements Yin objects were readily available at Suspension Skull Pass, but Earthly Yin energy was exceedingly rare.</p><p>It seemed he would need to return to his sect.  He’d been gone for many years and should visit.  He wondered how the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid was doing.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang opened all three storage pouches.</p><p>To his surprise, the scarred man's pouch contained a section of Earthfire Pan-tong root. It looked fresh, recently unearthed. It seemed the trap had indeed been meticulously set by Yu Daiyue and his companions.</p><p>The best lies, the most undetectable traps, contained a mix of truth and falsehood.</p><p>Back then, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage. If not for his luck in agreeing to help Wanderer Yun, he would have accepted Yu Daiyue's invitation.  That trip would have likely been fatal.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly, picking up the rough, gnarled root.</p><p>There was only the root, no Earthfire Pan-tong fluid.  He wondered if they had sold it or refined it themselves.</p><p>Channeling spiritual energy into a blade, he removed impurities from the root and extracted its purest essence, which he fed directly to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, inscribed with two Killing Talismans, had helped him break through to mid-Foundation Establishment.</p><p>However, two talismans were close to the sword's limit. Without further enhancement, it couldn't withstand the pressure of a third.</p><p>Although Qin Sang possessed the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, refining it could directly enhance his cultivation.  However, without strengthening the Ebony Sword and fully comprehending the third Killing Talisman, even the mushroom wouldn’t enable him to reach late-Foundation Establishment.</p><p>For Qin Sang, his natal sword and the Killing Talismans were his bottlenecks, albeit tangible ones.</p><p>After refining the Earthfire Pan-tong, Qin Sang sorted and stored the spoils, destroying the storage pouches.</p><p>Yu Daiyue's pouch was the most thought-provoking. It was filled with jade slips and manuals, all purportedly containing secrets to enhance cultivation.</p><p>Most, in Qin Sang's view, were baseless and ridiculous.</p><p>For instance, one described an acupuncture technique with silver needles, clearly derived from mortal martial arts.  Yet, Yu Daiyue treasured it, perhaps even trying each method.</p><p>After healing and recovering, Qin Sang opened the sand cave and set off for the Celestial Crystal Secret Realm.</p><p>Teng Nan congratulated him again upon seeing him. Qin Sang stayed and cultivated nearby.</p><p>Ten months later, Qin Sang left the Cloud Beast lair and returned to the secret realm.</p><p>The auction at Gloom Mountain Pass was less than two months away.  Qin Sang decided to consolidate his recent gains before departing.</p><p>In the quiet of his cave, Qin Sang entered meditation.</p><p>Breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment, the Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter of his cultivation technique brought new changes, which Qin Sang had familiarized himself with.</p><p>The most noticeable was the increase in his cultivation speed.  With an additional Killing Talisman, not only was he comprehending the next one faster, but his overall cultivation speed had also increased.  He estimated it to be faster than a four-spiritual-root cultivator.</p><p>Even if he was slightly slower than a three-spiritual-root cultivator now, he would surpass them after inscribing the third talisman.</p><p>At his current pace, with the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, he estimated he could reach late-Foundation Establishment in twenty years.</p><p>The trip to Autumn Wilds Market, though failing to resolve his foundational issues, had yielded three thousand-year-old spiritual herbs. The benefits were substantial and well worth the journey.</p><p>The cultivation time saved by these herbs would give him more opportunities to seek fortune for Core Formation and find ways to repair his foundation.</p><p>This speed was considered above average among his fellow disciples at Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Of course, this was contingent upon strengthening the Ebony Sword and avoiding further distractions.</p><p>If Qin Sang's talent were better, his cultivation speed would be even more astonishing. No wonder Senior Qingzhu had achieved Core Formation in forty years.</p><p>Unfortunately, talent was innate and couldn’t be envied.</p><p>Three days later,</p><p>Qin Sang left seclusion, bid farewell to Teng Nan, and flew towards Everbright Market.</p><p>He decided to travel along the border of the Ancient Battlefield to Gloom Mountain Pass. He stopped at the Everbright branch of the Taiyi Elixir Hall to sell some miscellaneous items and purchase elixirs.</p><p>The shop manager, an elderly man surnamed Liu, was at the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Manager Liu recognized Qin Sang. He hurriedly rose and bowed.  “Fellow Daoist Qin, I recently received news from Junior Brother Yun. He has finished his seclusion and decided to cultivate in his cave for a while.  He learned that you had sought him out and sent a message. If you have any urgent matters, you can visit him directly.”</p><p>Qin Sang did intend to consult Wanderer Yun about his foundational issues and seek his advice on a solution.</p><p>Before going to the Celestial Crystal Secret Realm, he had asked Manager Liu to keep an eye out for Wanderer Yun. He hadn’t expected Yun to have already emerged and sent a message.</p><p>"Senior Liu, did Senior Yun gain anything from his seclusion?  Could he be breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment?"</p><p>Wanderer Yun, achieving Foundation Establishment at such an advanced age, must have had better talent than himself, though his breakthrough had left hidden flaws that hindered his cultivation progress.</p><p>If the Nine Radiance Azure Frost Grass proved effective in healing his injuries, a breakthrough to mid-Foundation Establishment should be within reach.</p><p>"I'm afraid I don't know," Manager Liu shook his head slightly, his tone filled with admiration. "However, Junior Brother Yun often works wonders.  Perhaps, as Fellow Daoist Qin suggests, he has indeed advanced further!"</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Everbright Market, Qin Sang pondered for a moment.  Instead of returning to Suspension Skull Pass, he flew eastward.</p><p>Wanderer Yun would remain cultivating in his cave and wouldn’t leave for a year or two.  He could visit after the auction.</p>
