<h1>Chapter 509: A Casual Stroke</h1><p>Chapter 509: A Casual Stroke</p><p>Truth be told, none of the four had ever met the leader of the Black Robe Sect in person.  This was the sect leader's first public appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, his gaze sweeping across the four. He already knew their temperaments well.  The Black Robe Sect leader remained hidden, his true nature yet unrevealed.  Despite the sect's name, its disciples were unaffected and indistinguishable from those of ordinary cultivation sects.</p><p>Among the four, Mei Gu was the kindest and held the highest prestige within the sect.</p><p>"Rise," Qin Sang said, getting straight to the point.  "I've summoned you and your fellow disciples, Luo and the others, for an urgent matter.  We'll be leaving the mountain and I'm unsure how long we'll be gone.  The four of you will remain behind.  In my absence, Mei Gu will act as sect leader, assisted by the other three…"</p><p>The four were astonished by this announcement from their sect leader.  Regardless of their thoughts, Qin Sang issued his orders decisively.</p><p>The foundation left behind by the Black Robe Sect leader was excellent. Both the mountain's spirit veins and protective formation were top-notch and needed no alteration.</p><p>"After I leave, prioritize your own cultivation and the sect's strength. Continue your usual practices. The protective formation is sufficient to ensure your safety. Remember, when traveling, avoid any provocative actions that might attract enemies to the sect, or I will personally punish you…"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.  A lightning bolt suddenly flashed from his brow, accompanied by earth-shattering thunder. Sword energy, like a cascading waterfall, descended upon the four!</p><p>The killing intent of the sword energy was overwhelming. The aura of the magical artifact fully erupted, shocking the four into terrified silence.  They couldn't believe that the figure beneath the black robe was merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator, using his life-bound sword to bluff.</p><p>This single sword strike left an unforgettable impression.</p><p>When Qin Sang withdrew his ebony sword, and the sword energy dissipated, the four were drenched in cold sweat, looking as if they had been washed. Lu Xing and the others even trembled.</p><p>"We dare not!"</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing their fearful state, Qin Sang softened his tone slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of becoming a true sect leader.  His talent was mediocre, his own safety precarious; he would never focus on something he couldn't control, so he wouldn't invest extra energy into the Black Robe Sect.</p><p>This was merely a casual endeavor by Qin Sang. It might prove useful, it might not.</p><p>The foundation cultivated by the Black Robe Sect leader was nearly complete.  Since there were no hidden dangers, leaving it as it was was better than destroying it.</p><p>The Black Robe Sect was still weak. Its future development depended entirely on its members.  However, since Qin Sang had intervened, he had to leave his mark before departing, lest the future disciples only know the acting sect leader and not the true one.</p><p>"Summon all disciples under fifty who have reached the tenth level of Qi Condensation…" Qin Sang instructed Mei Gu.</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Mei Gu, much calmer than the others, readily obeyed and went to carry out his orders.</p><p>Soon, all eligible disciples were gathered. Qin Sang distributed some of his spoils of war, personally bestowing each with a high-grade magic weapon as an incentive. Mei Gu and the others received top-grade magic weapons.</p><p>Though they were only ordinary top-grade artifacts, they still excited Mei Gu and the others.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang dismissed the others, and spoke privately with Mei Gu for a while, leaving her with some items before departing.</p><p>Leaving the volcano, Qin Sang put the Black Robe Sect out of his mind. The minimal time spent there allowed him more time for preparations; infiltrating the Qingyang Demon Sect was the real priority.</p><p>After descending the mountain, Qin Sang returned to the cave.  He sat down on a rock and opened the corpse puppet bag. Fourteen corpses lay in a row before him.</p><p>Soul-Attracting Grass was rare. Qin Sang only had two Heavenly Corpse Talismans left and was unwilling to waste them on these corpses, so he had killed them.  He planned to use the two Foundation Establishment cultivators to create煞尸 (corpse puppets) for his own use.</p><p>The remaining twelve would mostly be made into zombies, with a few more煞尸.  Qin Sang's plan to infiltrate the Qingyang Demon Sect was closely related to these zombies, which he intended to sell to the disciples of the Qingyang Demon Sect in Qingyang Market!</p><p>煞尸 were too conspicuous to have too many of. Zombies, however, posed no problem, their strength comparable to that of Qi Condensation cultivators. The corpse refinement methods of the Heavenly Corpse Sect were not very different from other corpse refinement sects, but they could borrow a wisp of earth煞之气(earthly evil energy) to quickly create them.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect, unlike other demon sects, wasn't inherently bloodthirsty or reckless.  However, having grown up in the demon world, they were desensitized to many things.</p><p>Raising and trading corpses wasn't unusual; disciples often bought them for self-defense, a practice the Sect didn't heavily regulate.</p><p>However, with the current unstable situation, the Sect was cautious.  Even Qin Sang wasn't sure if disciples were allowed to bring in corpses of unknown origin.</p><p>These corpses were Qin Sang's scouts.  If they could enter the Qingyang Demon Sect, he could easily follow.</p><p>Since obtaining the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, Qin Sang, now a Foundation Establishment cultivator, had never crafted a zombie before, but he was already highly skilled in creating煞尸 (煞 corpses), making zombies a simple task.</p><p>Qin Sang chose a cultivator, destroyed his dantian, erased all traces of his Foundation Establishment cultivation, then drew in negative energy, beginning to inscribe corpse control talismans.</p><p>The process was swift and effortless.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang added the prepared demonic beast soul and earth煞 energy.</p><p>This step required more care, but posed no challenge to Qin Sang. He methodically followed each step, finally completing another zombie.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang caught the zombie's punch with one hand and sensed its power.</p><p>Its strength was comparable to an eleventh-level Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p>Zombies made from Foundation Establishment cultivators typically possessed at least tenth-level Qi Condensation strength.  Qin Sang deliberately varied the power levels to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang channeled corpse energy throughout the zombie, completely obliterating its former appearance, transforming it into a truly monstrous, fanged creature.</p><p>Qin Sang spent two days in the cave, completing all the zombies, storing them in his corpse puppet bag, and then heading towards Qingyang City.</p><p>…</p><p>The Spiritual Tide was at its peak; Qingyang City and Tianyou Pass were sealed.</p><p>Many cultivators gathered outside the two passes, waiting for the tide to subside so they could be among the first to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to search for treasures.  It was also a convenient place to gather information.</p><p>With so many cultivators concentrated at the passes, auctions were constantly held, with rare treasures frequently appearing. Surely, even the Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master couldn't ignore such temptations?</p><p>Qin Sang, using the alias Qingfeng Daoist, mingled amongst the crowd. He learned that neither Tianyou Pass nor Qingyang City had seen the Sect Master.</p><p>The Sect Master was incredibly patient.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, resigned to waiting. After meeting with Yunyouzi, they each took a pass, waiting for the opportune moment.</p>
