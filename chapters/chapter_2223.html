<h1>Chapter 2213: Yin and Yang</h1><p>Yu Zhen remained calm under everyone's gaze, appearing confident and fearless.</p><p>Qin Sang sized Yu Zhen up, unsure whether the man was genuinely being friendly or harboring a threat, or perhaps both.</p><p>However, Yu Zhen's appearance and public show of goodwill were clearly advantageous to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>With Zhang Yan captured, and who knew how many more helpers Yu Zhen had, the balance of power had shifted.  Previously, Zhan Yan's group had a numerical advantage, allowing them to exert pressure; now, the situation was reversed.</p><p>Furthermore, Yu Zhen's unexpected arrival introduced a major variable.</p><p>The existence of the Chunqiu Gui might be revealed by Yu Zhen, leading to otherworldly cultivators vying for it – something the few of them couldn't possibly prevent!</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, don't play games.  As long as you join forces with us to eliminate this person, we'll believe he wasn't brought here by you! Otherwise, if the Chunqiu Gui falls into the hands of the otherworldly, you'll be the sinner of all the Taishang Dao lineages!" Zhan Yan hissed, transmitting his voice.</p><p>Even he, with his temperament, found it difficult to remain calm. Jing Zheng and Xu Mu were also shocked and enraged.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang remained unmoved. Unlike Zhan Yan and the others, he wasn't from the Taishang Dao lineage and had no attachment to the treasure. He didn't care who got the Chunqiu Gui, unless it chose him or Liuli as its master, but that possibility was extremely slim.</p><p>Although Liuli was Ning Zhenren's disciple, among those Transcending Void cultivators, who could expect a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator to protect the Chunqiu Gui?</p><p>The Chunqiu Gui was a postnatal spiritual treasure, possessing a spirit. No one could control the spirit's will. If it truly chose an otherworldly cultivator, it meant the cultivator had the destined opportunity, and there was nothing anyone could do.</p><p>Besides, since Yu Zhen dared to appear, he must have a backup plan and confidence in his ability to escape unscathed.</p><p>"This man claims he followed Daoist Jing Zheng here.  The three of you met halfway and still failed to notice him.  You should think about how to clear your names first! I suspect you're acting with ulterior motives and trying to frame me!" Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>"Don't you dare slander us!"</p><p>Jing Zheng was ashamed and furious; if things were truly investigated, her guilt would be the greatest.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal wasn't to provoke them, so he softened his tone.  "In my opinion, the situation is irreversible.  We should put aside our differences and think about how to remedy the situation. Even if we kill this person, we can't stop him from spreading the news; it would only waste precious time.  Perhaps the news has already spread, and otherworldly experts are on their way…"</p><p>He paused, looking at Zhan Yan and the other two, seeing a flicker of hesitation in their eyes.  He continued, "The Chunqiu Gui is a postnatal spiritual treasure; its spirit has its own will. Since it's our Taishang treasure, it won't be easily taken by outsiders. Even if... the spirit chooses someone else, that's the spirit's own will; how could the sect blame us?"</p><p>Zhan Yan's expression shifted slightly.  "Qin Zhenren means…"</p><p>"Let's take turns trying. We're willing to take a step back and let your group go first," Qin Sang conceded.</p><p>He didn't know how long before the talismans in his sleeve would react. He had to act according to Hong Tian's instructions; failing to do so would have unimaginable consequences.</p><p>Therefore, they had to find that secret realm before then. Time was precious, and Qin Sang didn't want to get entangled with Zhan Yan and the others for too long.</p><p>If the Chunqiu Gui recognized a master, the order wouldn't matter.</p><p>Zhan Yan's gaze flickered, glancing at Yu Zhen, who remained calm.  If it were only Qin Sang and Liuli, they could still fight. But now, the other side had at least three people.  Even if they won, as Qin Sang said, it would waste too much time.</p><p>After a brief private discussion, Zhan Yan transmitted his voice, "Fine! We'll follow Qin Zhenren's suggestion. But what should we do with this person?"</p><p>Everyone looked at Yu Zhen again.</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands. "We have important matters to discuss. Could Daoist Yu please excuse yourself for a moment?"</p><p>"My apologies," Yu Zhen readily complied, returning a bow. He produced a jade slip. "The information about that Zhenren is recorded in this jade slip.  Qin Zhenren can handle it."</p><p>He tossed the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it, pondering. "Daoist Yu, please wait for me nearby. After we're finished, I'll discuss this further with you."</p><p>Yu Zhen was delighted.  "Good! I'll wait for Qin Zhenren on that mountain over there!"</p><p>With that, Yu Zhen turned and flew away, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After Yu Zhen left, everyone looked at each other and jointly laid down a restriction, isolating the white cloud from the outside world.</p><p>The Chunqiu Gui hadn't appeared yet. Even if Yu Zhen guessed there was a big secret here, he likely didn't know it was a postnatal spiritual treasure.  Delaying the revelation was a priority.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the jade slip. He wasn't planning to do anything to Zhang Yan, but he wouldn't hand over the jade slip either; it would serve as a warning to Zhan Yan and the others.</p><p>"Who shall go first?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Three cultivators exchanged glances.  Zhan Yan stepped forward. "I shall approach the spirit first.  Please, fellow cultivators, protect me."</p><p>With that, Zhan Yan flew into the clouds.  The clouds shifted, swallowing him whole.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the others flew to the edge of the cloud, activating their spiritual sight.  They vaguely saw what lay within.</p><p>At the cloud's center, where the cloud thinned, an ancient temple hung suspended.  It was a three-tiered round hall, its architecture ancient and reminiscent of a sacrificial temple.</p><p>A plaque hung above the entrance, bearing two ancient characters, "Sun Moon," their forms echoing the celestial bodies.  The hall was clearly named the Sun Moon Hall.</p><p>The Sun Moon Hall's doors were sealed shut. The Spring and Autumn Gnomon, a powerful spiritual treasure, lay within.  Only with the spirit's consent could the hall be opened and the gnomon obtained.</p><p>Zhan Yan reached the hall's entrance, encountering some kind of resistance, stopping him in his tracks. He waited for the resistance to subside, and the others watched patiently. After a short while, Zhan Yan stepped forward, finally reaching the steps.</p><p>"Disciple Zhan Yan, of the Bi Chen Xuan lineage of the Taishang Dao, greets the esteemed spirit."</p><p>Zhan Yan performed a deep Daoist bow. He waited, but the hall remained unresponsive.</p><p>Disappointed, he adjusted his robes, sat cross-legged before the entrance, and sent out his spiritual sense towards the Sun Moon Hall.</p><p>Whether a common treasure or a powerful one, the acceptance of an owner is usually instantaneous.</p><p>Earlier, they'd agreed to a time limit of one cup of tea per person.</p><p>Zhan Yan remained motionless.  His expression shifted from puzzled to contemplative.  As the time limit neared, receiving no response, he grew anxious, urgently transmitting a message about the situation outside, hoping to persuade the spirit.</p><p>"Daoist Zhan Yan, your time is up."</p><p>Qin Sang's voice sounded in his ear.</p><p>Zhan Yan opened his eyes, disappointment flashing in them. The spirit had remained unresponsive; he couldn't enter the Sun Moon Hall.</p><p>Hesitantly, respecting their agreement, Zhan Yan left the cloud.</p><p>Liuli and Qin Sang exchanged a look and flew inside.</p><p>"Disciple Liuli, a student of Ning Xuanzhen, greets the esteemed spirit." Liuli also bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed Zhan Yan and the others. He noticed their initial confusion, then Zhan Yan's sudden shock.</p><p>"Ning Zhenren truly holds a high position within the Taishang Dao," Qin Sang mused, turning his attention back to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli sat before the Sun Moon Hall, not activating the Ce Yi Tian Huang Talisman.  Powerful as it was, it was useless now. Whether she gained the spirit's acceptance depended on her.</p><p>Initially, like Zhan Yan, Liuli sat still.</p><p>Midway through the allotted time, Liuli's face paled, and she vomited blood.</p><p>Blood stained the steps, a shocking sight.</p><p>Everyone's hearts leaped, Zhan Yan and the others recalling various legends of blood sacrifices.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's expression remained grave. He suspected Liuli's cultivation was insufficient to withstand the hall's power.</p><p>The Daoist sect valued the Spring and Autumn Gnomon highly; it ranked among the most powerful spiritual treasures. Even its residual energy was too much for a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Liuli's face was ashen, blood staining her white robes, making her look unusually vulnerable.  She slowly stood, gazing at the hall's apex. After a moment, she tapped the hall's restrictions with her jade fingers.</p><p>Zhan Yan and the others frowned but didn't stop her.</p><p>Next was Jing Zhen.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liuli, noticing her restored complexion and steady breath, and felt relieved. He asked, "How is it?"</p><p>Liuli nodded, indicating progress.</p><p>Legend held that all the arrangements here were for the Spring and Autumn Gnomon.  Several key locations were intricately connected to the Sun Moon Hall. Their goal was to locate one; finding the Sun Moon Hall would reveal the others, and vice versa.</p><p>Finally confirming the target's location, both breathed a sigh of relief, but didn't leave immediately.</p><p>A powerful spiritual treasure lay before them; even if hope was slim, Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>After another cup of tea, Jing Zhen returned empty-handed.  It was Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>He flashed through the clouds, arriving before the Sun Moon Hall.</p><p>"Junior Qin Sang, greets the esteemed spirit."</p><p>Unlike the others, he didn't state his lineage. After waiting without response, he sat down.</p><p>Then, following Liuli's instructions, Qin Sang sent out a strand of spiritual sense to touch the door.</p><p>He encountered no resistance; it felt as though nothing was there; his spiritual sense passed through easily.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang saw a pure white expanse!</p><p>Above, below, left, right, in every direction, there was nothing but a pure white light. It wasn't the scorching heat of the sun, nor the cool light of the moon; Qin Sang felt a gentle warmth.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's only sensation. He understood why Zhan Yan and the others were lost in confusion.</p><p>There was nothing here, an immense emptiness.  Qin Sang allowed his spiritual sense to roam, but the emptiness remained.</p><p>"What meaning does this image hold?"</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>In fact, this was the question that plagued all of the Taishang lineage. Countless cultivation geniuses had been sent here over the centuries, yet none had been able to unravel its mystery and obtain the Chunqiu Gui.</p><p>They surmised that this might be a trial left by the Taishang ancestor, a test that only those who passed could receive the Chunqiu Gui's acknowledgement.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was lost in contemplation, he saw darkness approaching from one direction, and the familiar cycle of day and night reappeared.</p><p>Darkness surged, pushing back the light, instantly plunging him into night.</p><p>The cycle of day and night here was far faster than in the outside world, completing three cycles in a flash.</p><p>The alternation of day and night, the turning of Yin and Yang…</p><p>Countless thoughts flooded Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The Sun-Moon Palace, the Chunqiu Gui, spring's birth and autumn's death…</p><p>The Dao of Yin and Yang was the very foundation of Daoist cultivation!</p><p>Qin Sang believed that countless ancestors of the Taishang lineage had come before him, and surely not just he had made the connection to Yin and Yang. Nor could his understanding surpass that of the orthodox Daoist inheritors.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang fell into thought, but he wasn't thinking about how to unravel the secrets of this place.  His mind was on the two treasures he carried—the black and white pieces!</p><p>The white piece came from the Lan Dou Gate.</p><p>The black piece came from a piece of jade he received from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  The Ferryman of the Nie River had broken the jade, revealing the two pieces.</p><p>Having possessed the black and white pieces for years, Qin Sang was certain of their connection to the Dao of Yin and Yang. He had even considered them as an alternative path in his cultivation, but had yet to unlock their secrets.</p><p>In recent years, Qin Sang had almost ignored these two treasures.</p><p>He had already grasped the Dao of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* for the Transcendence stage. His past experiences had proven him right; if he continued along this path, a smooth road lay ahead.</p><p>At least before the Unity stage, he saw no need to change paths.</p><p>The higher his cultivation, the more Qin Sang understood the difficulties of the Dao.  With his current energy, he couldn’t manage everything, and had to make choices. Even the *Tianyao Refining Form* technique was gradually falling behind.</p><p>Even though the black and white pieces might contain the Great Dao of Yin and Yang, he had put them aside, making little progress.</p><p>Since they belonged to the Dao of Yin and Yang, could he use this place to understand the pieces better?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare hope for the Chunqiu Gui to acknowledge him.  If he could unravel some secrets of the black and white pieces, the journey wouldn't be in vain.</p><p>He wouldn't change his cultivation path now, but perhaps after reaching the Unity stage, they might prove useful.  Preparing in advance wasn't a bad thing.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The black and white pieces revolved around his primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang connected his mind to the pieces, and his spiritual sense within the Sun-Moon Palace also took on his form.</p><p>The spiritual sense embodiment looked down at his own palm, where a black and a white vortex appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to make them spin, but failed. The black vortex shattered as soon as it appeared, while the white vortex remained.</p><p>It was daytime!</p><p>The vortex expanded, solidifying, finally forming a phantom white piece.</p><p>"It really works!"</p><p>Qin Sang joyfully discovered that the surrounding light was drawn to the white piece, automatically gathering in his palm.</p><p>This was the first time he had caused a change here.  Immediately, he immersed his mind fully into the white piece. As the white light gathered, a distinct halo formed around the piece, the light seeming to penetrate into its interior.</p><p>At that moment, darkness dispelled the light, and the white piece shattered. Qin Sang immediately switched to the black piece, and a similar phenomenon occurred.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang still didn't receive any response from a spirit, but as the power of this place continuously permeated the pieces, his mind sank deeper and deeper, as if passing through invisible membranes, gradually peering into their interiors.</p><p>Astonishingly, the black and white pieces were unfathomably deep, vast beyond measure; Qin Sang felt an immeasurable profundity, with no discernible source.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, time's up. It's my turn," Xu Mu's voice interrupted, jolting Qin Sang awake.</p>
