<h1></h1><p>Inside the room.</p><p>Shi Xue, accompanied by the ice sculpture, sat restlessly.</p><p>She worried that the ungrateful scoundrel would not recognize his relatives and friends, not appreciate good intentions, and ruthlessly destroy beauty. She also worried that her younger sister would enter a wolf's den, unable to resist the scoundrel's sweet talk, and be abducted.</p><p>While lost in her wild thoughts, she finally saw a faint silhouette slowly appearing at the doorway.</p><p>"Junior Sister!"</p><p>Shi Xue stood up quickly, stepped forward, and sized up her junior sister, ensuring she hadn't suffered any losses.</p><p>Luli's expression was unchanged from when she left, seemingly unaware of Shi Xue's strange gaze, and she softly asked, "When will the Grand Elder return?"</p><p>"Did you convince that ungrateful wretch to return the sacred object?"</p><p>Shi Xue was suspicious.</p><p>That fellow was unruly and ungrateful; how could he be persuaded with mere words?</p><p>Luli said, "He wants to discuss it in detail with the Grand Elder."</p><p>"I knew it!"</p><p>Shi Xue snorted, "Elder Mei has already sent a message to the Grand Elder, and she won't arrive for at least ten days."</p><p>Luli nodded, waved to dispel the ice sculpture, and returned to her prayer mat to sit in the lotus position.</p><p>Shi Xue's gaze followed Luli's movements, her red lips slightly parted, wanting to ask something but refraining.</p><p>...</p><p>Pearl Island.</p><p>The Fire Chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat beside the furnace, oblivious to the passage of time, not moving an inch.</p><p>At this moment, the Fire Chamber did not have the intense heat it once did, nor was it as brightly lit with fiery red light.</p><p>Inside the furnace in front of him burned black flames, like a dormant black dragon; it was none other than Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Using demonic fire to refine a supreme-grade magic treasure, even though Qin Sang had already cultivated the first level of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, the consumption was truly astonishing, beads of sweat forming on his brow.</p><p>At the center of the demonic fire, a ball of golden liquid formed a perfect sphere, suspended in the air.</p><p>The surface of the sphere was mottled, like patches of red clouds, transformed from the Fallen Phoenix Jade.</p><p>Between the red clouds, blue stars were dotted, which was none other than Azure Star Gold.</p><p>Between the azure stars were connected silver threads, which was the Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid.</p><p>All three spiritual objects were thrown into the furnace by Qin Sang, to be melted together into the spirit sword's body. As time passed, the sphere stretched, revealing the shape of a sword; the red clouds, azure stars, and silver threads gradually merged with the spirit sword, the brilliance slowly fading.</p><p>One could see:</p><p>The sword body gleamed with golden radiance, dotted with azure stars.</p><p>The red jade carved the sword hilt, silver threads depicted its design.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang threw another drop of Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid into the furnace, his palm gripping tightly. The surface of the spirit sword was instantly coated with a layer of silver paint, completely permeating it, truly embodying "golden splendor sinking, silver light appearing."</p><p>Then, the sword hilt and guard melted, transforming into a hiltless, three-inch-long small sword, shimmering with silver light.</p><p>Compared to when he fought the Old Fiend Hunmo, its form was completely different, and not a trace of the Gold Submergence Sword could be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, reached out, and the Gold Submergence Sword landed in his palm like a swimming fish. Because he had used it for many years and had personally refined it, there was no need for too much trouble to be able to refine it as he wished.</p><p>"Finally, a supreme-grade magic treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled lightly, a sense of blood connection emanating from the spirit sword, and he smiled.</p><p>Only then did he feel utterly exhausted. He left the Fire Chamber, returned to his cave, and sat in meditation to recover. Once he felt refreshed, he summoned the Gold Submergence Sword and focused on refining it.</p><p>When that Grand Elder found out, she would definitely come to demand the sacred object immediately. Qin Sang seized the time, lest there be a rift at that time, preventing him from using the sword array, and weakening his strength instead of increasing it.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang expected, within two days, the new Gold Submergence Sword was already as responsive as his own limbs.</p><p>*‘Swoosh! Swoosh!’*</p><p>The spirit sword circled around his body, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, leaving behind trails of afterimages, weaving a sword net.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to activate the Seven Soul Killing Array, practicing briefly. Although there was no opponent, he could sense that the power was indeed on a different level, and he couldn't help but nod secretly.</p><p>After trying it out.</p><p>He put away the spirit sword and took out a jade slip.</p><p>Recorded within the jade slip was the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*. Qin Sang was about to read it, comprehending this body refinement divine ability, when he suddenly felt an unusual fluctuation coming from a sound transmission talisman inside the Thousand钧 Ring. </p><p>"The Grand Elder of the Profound Heaven Palace has arrived,"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He took out the sound transmission talisman and crushed it, then left the cave and escaped from Pearl Island.</p><p>He had already chosen a place and made preparations. He flew south for a while and found a deserted island. He landed on the shore, gazed east, and patiently waited for the arrival of his guests.</p><p>Before long, he saw two figures gracefully approaching from the horizon, like two celestial maidens descending to the mortal realm.</p><p>One of them was Luli.</p><p>The other was a beautifully dressed woman in palace attire, also wearing a white dress and a phoenix crown, with a dignified aura, clearly a person who had long been in a high position.</p><p>Qin Sang looked behind them, but did not find any other figures; surprisingly, only the two of them had come.</p><p>The other party also noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Luli's lips moved slightly, silently saying something. The Grand Elder opened her eyes and looked over, her eyes bright and captivating, with a forceful aura in her gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, facing the Grand Elder with composure.</p><p>With just a single glance, Qin Sang felt a sense of apprehension toward this Grand Elder and did not dare to underestimate her in the slightest.</p><p>Nothing could be discerned from her appearance.</p><p>The Grand Elder's aura was complete, and her injuries seemed to have healed.</p><p>As for spiritual treasures, it was even more impossible to keep them outside at all times.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two women flew over. The Grand Elder quickly scanned the small island and landed directly on the shore.</p><p>"This place is desolate, and I have not prepared immortal tea. Please forgive me, Grand Elder."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and cupped his hands in a salute.</p><p>"Daoist Qin is too polite."</p><p>The Grand Elder's voice was as clear as a young girl's, and she returned the salute, her tone quite amiable, but unconsciously carrying a hint of majesty, "Grand Elder is merely an honorary title within the sect, and I dare not flaunt it outside. My surname is Tong, and my given name is Lingyu. I have already learned about Daoist Qin's deeds from Elder Mei and Luli and admire them."</p><p>"Daoist Tong is too kind. The rumors must be exaggerated. Qin cannot truly take credit!"</p><p>Qin Sang was agreeable and looked at Luli again, not knowing what Luli had told the Grand Elder. He nodded slightly, "Thank you, Immortal Maiden, for your trouble these past few days."</p><p>Luli shook her head and remained silent.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's gaze swept over the two of them. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, she did not ask about the sacred object but spoke of other matters, "That traitor was likely personally eliminated by Daoist Qin. On behalf of the Palace Lord and the entire Profound Heaven Palace, I thank you."</p><p>As she spoke, Tong Lingyu solemnly performed a salute, "I already know the details of what happened on the day of the Myriad Fiend Assembly. Elder Mei and Elder Lan were inconsiderate and actually took action against you in order to understand the situation. I originally wanted them to apologize to you in person, but I was afraid of being abrupt and causing you to misunderstand. When we return to the mountain..."</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue inwardly. He didn't want to be placed on a pedestal. He immediately interrupted Tong Lingyu, saying, "Before the Myriad Fiend Assembly, I was not aware of any connection between that person and the Profound Heaven Palace, and I had no grudges against him. Moreover, I was hunting a Rainbow Rat demon king that day and didn't expect that the demon king's body housed the spiritual body of a human cultivator. It was purely accidental."</p><p>"Rainbow Rat?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu and Luli exchanged a glance, understanding dawning on them.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's cave was in the eastern region of the demon realm. The Profound Heaven Palace was no stranger to it. They were chasing the traitor into the demon realm and happened to pass near the Rainbow Rat demon king's territory. Without Qin Sang explaining the details, they could guess the truth.</p><p>The traitor had likely been near the demon realm all along and had been entangled by the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Tong Lingyu seemed relieved, "Fortunately, the sacred object did not fall into the hands of the demon race."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was not someone who could be manipulated with words, she stopped beating around the bush and directly mentioned the sacred object, "Forgive me for being presumptuous, but Luli said that you intend to return the sacred object. You haven't changed your mind these days, have you?"</p><p>Qin Sang did not take it to heart and smiled, "If I had changed my mind, you two wouldn't be seeing me today! Fortunately, Immortal Maiden Luli persuaded me earnestly, and I realized the significance of this object. The Profound Heaven Palace upholds the heart of righteousness, suppressing the demon race in the north and preventing the Great Sages from acting recklessly, and restraining the Old Fiend Hunmo and controlling his demonic flames in the south. Only in this way can the cultivation world maintain stability, and we rogue cultivators will not fall into slaughter. If I were to seize the sacred object of the Profound Heaven Palace, wouldn't I be making those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice?"</p><p>His words were righteous and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Luli kept looking at him.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression paused slightly. After a moment of silence, she said, "Daoist Qin's words are very true. However, that traitor possessed some divine abilities. Daoist Qin must have taken many risks to eliminate him. We cannot let you make such a sacrifice in vain."</p><p>Qin Sang did not answer, simply looking at Tong Lingyu with anticipation.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Luli next to her and said, "I heard that Daoist Qin is quite interested in the Holy Land and wishes to observe the ceremony. I can agree to that."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could show any joy.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's tone suddenly changed, "But it needs to be done indirectly."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He knew it wouldn't be that simple.</p><p>This condition seemed to require nothing from the Profound Heaven Palace and was the easiest of all the conditions, but Qin Sang knew that this condition was the most difficult to accept.</p><p>"Why?" Qin Sang asked vigilantly.</p><p>Tong Lingyu said frankly, "How important the Holy Land is to a sect, I need not elaborate. In particular, the Holy Land of the Profound Heaven Palace is related to the fundamental cultivation methods of each lineage and must not be lost. Daoist Qin should understand how important the Holy Land is to each lineage. On the day the Holy Land opens, with a figure of your stature observing nearby, how could each lineage not be suspicious? This place is far from the Hidden Sun Realm. By the time we return to the mountain and summon each lineage to discuss a plan, Daoist Qin would likely have lost patience."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang pondered to himself.</p><p>Earlier, he had subtly questioned Luli and roughly understood the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Such a colossal being dominating a realm must inevitably have factions and contradictions within it. The Palace Lord and the Grand Elder could not ignore the wishes of each lineage, and there were even checks and balances between them.</p><p>He did not rashly agree, "How does Daoist Tong want to do it indirectly?"</p><p>"It's very simple!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed at Luli, "If Daoist Qin doesn't mind, you can become a guest elder of the Listening Snow Tower. You only need to perform a reasonable play. Before the Holy Land opens, I will find a reason to give Daoist Qin a chance to observe the ceremony so that it will not attract attention. Of course, during this time, you need to disguise yourself as another identity and not reveal your true strength."</p><p>She only wanted to retrieve the sacred object as soon as possible to avoid any complications.</p><p>The sacred object had been lost for so long. Although they had tried their best to block the news, turmoil had still arisen within the Profound Heaven Palace. Some people were beginning to stir, and the pressure on her was great.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was not worried that Qin Sang would cause trouble in the Holy Land.</p><p>First, she could see that there was a close relationship between him and Luli, and she would have him swear an oath to his inner demon before the Holy Land opened.</p><p>Second, she would not let him truly enter the Holy Land, and the Palace Lord would also appear on that day.</p><p>"A guest elder of the Listening Snow Tower?"</p><p>Qin Sang was not averse to becoming a guest elder. Anyway, it was just an honorary title. He could enjoy some benefits in advance, and whether he contributed in the future was entirely up to him.</p><p>However, he keenly noticed the strangeness in Tong Lingyu's words, "What's the difference between that and a guest elder of the Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu explained, "Daoist Qin may not know that the lineages within the Profound Heaven Palace were actually independent sects in the Hidden Sun Realm before joining the Profound Heaven Palace. Now that they belong to the same sect, they still maintain a certain degree of autonomy and can independently invite guest elders. If you only join the Listening Snow Tower, it will not attract too much attention."</p><p>Luli interjected at the right time, explaining the benefits of a guest elder of the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Because it was part of a deal, the benefits were provided, but Qin Sang was not required to fulfill any responsibilities to the Listening Snow Tower, making him more of a guest than a guest elder.</p><p>Finally, Tong Lingyu added, "Those divine abilities that you demonstrated before left a deep impression on Elder Mei and the others, and they have been talking about them. Hehe... During this time, it's best to restrain yourself and not take action."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered secretly.</p><p>Disguising his identity was not difficult. Within the Profound Heaven Palace, only the divine senses of the Grand Elder and the Palace Lord could match his. Unless others had special divine abilities, it would be difficult to see through his disguise.</p><p>Thunderous Escape, Sword Array, Thunder Manipulation Technique, and Demonic Fire had all been exposed.</p><p>However, his methods were not limited to these.</p><p>He knew more than just one sword technique. The *Azure Bamboo Sword Scripture* was also a top-tier sword scripture. The part that Qingzhu had comprehended on his own was very different from the *Primal Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, which was entirely capable of confusing others.</p><p>He only needed to use the Seven Soul Killing Array to deal with the Grand Elder and the Palace Lord. There was no need to hide it at that point.</p><p>In addition, there was the newly acquired *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*, which he could use to disguise himself as a body refiner.</p><p>If the Nascent Soul Puppet could be refined into an external avatar using the *Nine Nether Returning Yin Jade Chapter*, he could also pretend to be a cultivator who relied on an avatar.</p><p>At worst, he could be more low-key.</p><p>Thinking of the Nascent Soul Puppet, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the various pieces of information he had gathered through the Pill Cauldron Society these days.</p><p>After the Myriad Fiend Assembly, the Old Fiend Hunmo chased a mysterious expert for three thousand miles but was thrown off.</p><p>This matter had already swept through the Boundless Sea and become a legend.</p><p>Strangely, no more information had been leaked. The details of the chase, as well as Qin Sang's Demonic Fire, Nascent Soul Puppet, and other divine abilities, had not spread to the outside world.</p><p>It was still understandable that the Profound Heaven Palace did not want any complications and concealed the information.</p><p>The Old Fiend Hunmo did not promote the matter, perhaps because he felt it was damaging to his reputation or because he had other plans.</p><p>"I agree."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. As long as he could achieve his goal, the process was not important.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's face lit up, "Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Qin. In addition to this small matter, I can allow you to enter the treasure vault and select three treasures!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu was very decisive.</p><p>Qin Sang was also very surprised. He did not expect this Grand Elder to be so generous. He hesitated and asked, "Can I choose any treasure?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu's lips curved slightly, "Luli mentioned that you intend to refine an external avatar. As long as you swear never to spread it, I will give you the *Nine Nether Returning Yin Jade Chapter*. However, the Yin Sea Shell Pearls in the treasure vault have been exhausted. We need to wait for the new ones to be harvested from the Holy Land before sending them to you. Of course, that will count as two items!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the Profound Heaven Palace's top treasures could not be stored in the treasure vault, but treasures of the level of Yin Sea Shell Pearls and the *Nine Nether Returning Yin Jade Chapter* were tempting enough.</p><p>"Daoist Tong has brought too many surprises. I can't make a decision for a while!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew his limits and did not ask for more.</p><p>However, the one thing he wanted most was not mentioned by Tong Lingyu, "There is one more thing..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish speaking, Tong Lingyu already understood and said solemnly, "I am sorry to disappoint you, but the Palace Lord and I have both heard of Central Continent, but there are no sea charts in the palace."</p>
