<h1>Chapter 754: Peril</h1><p>“He was waiting for me!” Qin Sang had been wary of Cui Ji ever since they met and started traveling together.  Regardless of Cui Ji's intentions, Qin Sang wouldn't give him any opportunity.</p><p>Surrounded by demons, escape was uncertain.  Qin Sang hadn't expected Cui Ji to be mad enough to turn on him at this moment.</p><p>Even stranger, how did the Bone Lotus end up in Cui Ji's hands?</p><p>Xiang Yi was arguably the strongest of the eight present. Qin Sang admitted he wasn't Xiang Yi's match, but even against the subterranean beast, Xiang Yi shouldn't have perished and lost the treasure so quickly.</p><p>Unless there was something else afoot!</p><p>Suspicion and unease arose in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Overwhelming violet light filled Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>The Violet Orb's light, gentle yet powerful, had previously formed a cage, easily trapping the Night Devil. Now, it was as sharp as sword energy, fiercely aggressive.</p><p>The violet light was like a bolt of silk.  If struck, Qin Sang had no doubt his body would be riddled with holes.</p><p>Cui Ji had planned this for a long time, while Qin Sang was almost completely unprepared.</p><p>The distance between them was short, and Qin Sang was surrounded by Violet Star Eagles. Cui Ji's timing was impeccable, leaving no room for escape.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim. His first reaction was to open the Corpse Puppet Sack.</p><p>As the Night Devil leaped out, the violet light descended.</p><p>Dense corpse energy gathered in front of the Night Devil's chest. It stood before Qin Sang, shielding him from the attack, its fierce eyes wide, fearless.</p><p>Unfortunately, the time was too short. The corpse energy couldn't form a shield. Still thin and weak, it was pierced by the violet light and instantly dispersed.</p><p>All that remained was its physical body!</p><p>The Night Devil's body was tough, but it had its limits. Cui Ji, at the peak of mid-Core Formation, was stronger than twenty years ago, and the Violet Orb's power was also incomparable.</p><p>*Thud…*</p><p>The Night Devil's body, taking the brunt of the violet light, was instantly pierced with several large holes, a gruesome sight.</p><p>In that critical moment, Qin Sang tried to make the Night Devil avoid vital points, but the situation was too dire.  He didn't know and couldn't care about the Night Devil's condition.</p><p>The Night Devil blocked part of the violet light, buying Qin Sang precious time.</p><p>He frantically poured his True Essence into the Golden Radiance Armor. Golden light surged, condensing into a thick protective layer around him, like a war god.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Qin Sang was hit hard, his face turning pale. He was sent flying, crashing heavily into a Violet Star Eagle.</p><p>The eagle suffered the most. First injured by the impact, it fainted, then was pierced through the heart by the violet light, dying instantly.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and several Violet Star Eagles were engulfed by violet light.</p><p>*Clang! Clang!*</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out.</p><p>Within the violet light, Qin Sang fell to the ground, groaning. Violet light filled his chest. His face was drained of color.  His robes were torn, revealing the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>A deep dent appeared on the armor's chest, surrounded by small cracks spreading outwards.</p><p>Two strands of violet light, having penetrated the armor, struck the same spot.</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor was actually damaged!</p><p>Without it, Qin Sang would be in dire straits.</p><p>Cui Ji's sneak attack was vicious. If Qin Sang hadn't reacted quickly, the damage wouldn't be limited to a dent and cracks. This armor, comparable to a mid-grade magical treasure, might have been destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, suppressing the turbulent energy within him. Just as he was about to get up, a white light suddenly appeared behind the violet light – a flying knife.</p><p>The white light was the knife's aura. The blade was sleek, its speed faster than the violet light, flashing towards Qin Sang's neck.</p><p>The knife's long, slender form, with its chillingly sharp tip, was clearly a deadly weapon!</p><p>Cui Ji didn't possess this magical treasure twenty years ago. It was a new acquisition.</p><p>A flying knife after the violet light!</p><p>This was the true killing blow, incredibly vicious. It exploited the moment Qin Sang relaxed after blocking the violet light, arriving with lightning speed.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. The violet light was within his expectations, so he hadn't released his Twin-Headed Azure Serpent, intending to surprise Cui Ji.</p><p>Now, it was too late!</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sword's cry echoed.</p><p>The Ebony Sword appeared, accompanied by thunder. Simultaneously, serpent souls coiled around Qin Sang, radiating a bright red light.</p><p>Still on the ground, without even a chance to stand, he activated both the Sword Escape and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, exploding with incredible speed.</p><p>The flying knife slashed towards his neck.</p><p>In this suffocating moment, Qin Sang sprang up.  He could feel the chilling sensation on his neck, the icy blade almost touching his skin.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang narrowly avoided a fatal blow, but he still couldn't completely dodge the knife.  He was injured.</p><p>Excruciating pain shot through his shoulder, blood spurting.</p><p>The flying knife deeply sliced into his shoulder, almost severing his arm. Bone was visible, the knife stained crimson.</p><p>Qin Sang's arm went limp.  The True Essence within him vibrated violently, repelling the exhausted flying knife.</p><p>Pain contorted Qin Sang's face. He gritted his teeth, glaring fiercely at Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji looked surprised. He knew Qin Sang was fast, able to keep pace with Xiang Yi, but he hadn't expected such an explosive burst of speed, even faster than before, dodging a sure-kill attack.</p><p>This injury, though horrific, wasn't critical for a cultivator. Once the residual knife energy was purged, he could heal quickly.</p><p>Yet, Cui Ji smiled confidently, looking completely assured.</p><p>No matter how good his escape technique, it couldn't change anything!</p><p>This was the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone, unlike any other place. They were surrounded by endless poisonous mist. The knife strike not only severed Qin Sang's arm but also pierced his protective aura.</p><p>Poisonous mist, mixed with knife energy, had already invaded Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Adding insult to injury!</p><p>Poison in his internal organs, incurable.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang immediately circulated his cultivation technique to suppress the knife energy and expel the poison.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither the Violet Star Eagles nor Cui Ji would give him the chance.</p><p>Cui Ji beckoned, retrieving the flying knife.  This magical treasure, acquired at great cost, couldn't be tainted by Qin Sang's strange methods.</p><p>"Demon! Today is your death day!"</p><p>Cui Ji's expression was crazed, venting his malice.</p><p>Holding the Violet Orb, he attacked again relentlessly, giving Qin Sang no respite. He didn't need to kill Qin Sang himself; he only needed to keep him occupied until the poison took effect.</p><p>Being forced into such a perilous situation by a cultivator of the same realm was a long-forgotten experience.  After forming his Core, Qin Sang, with his various methods, had mostly dominated opponents of similar cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admire Cui Ji's deep scheming, perfect timing, and the devastating power of his attack that broke through his defenses.</p>
