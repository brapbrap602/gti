Chapter 203: Dry Sun Crystal

Qi Yuanchou was a man of ordinary appearance, clad in a white robe. Although he was three levels above Qin Sang, his demeanor was unassuming. He exuded no sense of oppression, but rather a certain warmth.

"Greetings, Elder Brother Qi," said Qin Sang.

Together with Jade Sun, Qin Sang bowed to Qi Yuanchou. Jade Sun introduced Qin Sang's origins to Qi Yuanchou before taking his leave.

"Younger Brother Qin, since we are fellow disciples, you need not participate in the Shadow Guard assessment. This is a Shadow Guard token. Take it. You are now a member of the Shadow Guard. Please fulfill the responsibilities given to you by both the sect and Xuanlan Pass."

Qi Yuanchou produced a token. He spoke in a gentle and friendly manner.

Qin Sang received the token. It was a magical device with a very different appearance from Jade Sun's. It was a black iron token with only the word 'Shadow' carved on it. Nothing else.

"Simply drip your blood essence on the token," Qi Yuanchou said.

Qin Sang did as instructed. When his blood essence landed on the token, it was automatically absorbed into it. Qin Sang felt an intimate connection with the token. He could easily send it into his body.

"You can use the token to see me directly. After you enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, there should be Shadow Guard outposts in the towns and markets along the road. Simply activate the token, and someone will contact you. They can deliver messages and provide some assistance..."

After patiently listening to Qi Yuanchou's introduction to Shadow Guard affairs, Qin Sang cupped his hands and said, "Many thanks for your detailed instructions, Elder Brother Qi. Qin Sang will definitely obey your commands and follow your lead."

Qi Yuanchou smiled and shook his head. "This is within my duty... Younger Brother Qin, since you have just joined the Shadow Guard, there's no rush for you to carry out a mission. You should enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and gain some experience first. Once you have familiarized yourself with the land, come to me within five years to take on a mission. That should be enough to silence any gossip."

Qin Sang was puzzled. Not only did Qi Yuanchou handle the miscellaneous affairs of Xuanlan Pass, but he also seemed to be always available. Did he not need to go into seclusion to cultivate?

Then he remembered that Qi Yuanchou was already a Nascent Soul realm expert. Unless he successfully formed his Golden Core, even if he went into seclusion for hundreds of years, his cultivation would not progress.

Perhaps for Nascent Soul realm experts, cultivating in seclusion was less effective than leaving their cave abodes and searching for the opportunity to form their Golden Cores.

"Thank you for your care, Elder Brother Qi. However..."

With that, Qin Sang repeated to Qi Yuanchou what he had just told Jade Sun. They were fellow disciples, so there was no need to hide anything.

"Oh? Is that so? It seems that the cultivation technique Younger Brother Qin has chosen is quite unique. You are very courageous. Since you are so determined, let me see..."

Qi Yuanchou was slightly surprised but did not ask any further questions. He placed his palm on a warm piece of jade on the table. After a while, he said with some regret, "Younger Brother Qin, you've come at an unfortunate time. The few missions in the outer region have already been assigned. I'm afraid there won't be any more available in the near future... If Younger Brother Qin is unable to wait, there is a mission that is not bad, but it requires us to go into the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. However, the purpose of the mission is to mine a spirit mine, which is not very dangerous. Ten people will go with you, including Fellow Disciple Mu Yifeng."

Qin Sang did not know Mu Yifeng and had no intention of relying on others to protect him. Based on what had happened to Sun De and Wu Yuesheng, the so-called camaraderie between fellow disciples could not always be trusted. The only one he could rely on was himself.

"Elder Brother Qi, I wonder which region this mission is in?"

"The middle region."

Upon hearing this, Qin Sang nodded slightly. Xuanlan Pass and the Demon Sect's territory were separated by Yinshan Pass and Chunyang City. Such a barrier was still effective to some extent in the middle region.

If they entered the inner region, it would become a chaotic land, completely out of the control of the major sects. They would have a high chance of encountering Demon Sect cultivators, perhaps even remnants of the Kuiying Sect.

Qin Sang had several good magical devices with him, which meant he was not afraid of Foundation Establishment cultivators in the early stage. However, if he encountered opponents who were even stronger, he could only try to escape.

"Everything will be as Elder Brother Qi decides," Qin Sang said with cupped hands.

...

There was a rapid sound of footsteps outside the door.

Qi Yuanchou was introducing the mission to Qin Sang when he suddenly stopped. "Younger Brother Mu, please come in."

Qin Sang stepped aside to make way.

The door was pushed open from the outside, and a burly man strode in. He was a rather粗犷, unkempt man, but his expression was calm, and his aura was not inferior to that of Senior Sister Qingting. He had already reached the threshold of the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment realm.

"Greetings, Elder Brother Qi!"

Mu Yifeng glanced at Qin Sang before clasping his hands at Qi Yuanchou in greeting. His voice was loud and reverberating.

"Junior Apprentice Brother Qin, this is Junior Apprentice Brother Mu Yifeng... This is Junior Apprentice Brother Qin Sang Qin..."
Qi Yuan Shou introduced the two to each other, then said to Mu Yifeng: "Junior Apprentice Brother Mu, Junior Apprentice Brother Qin also accepted this task, to gather the dry sun quartz. You two will travel together, which will provide more protection."
Mu Yifeng greeted Qin Sang warmly and laughed: "It would be best if Junior Apprentice Brother Qin could help me. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to control those little fellows! Senior Apprentice Brother Qi must have told Junior Apprentice Brother Qin, right? To gather the dry sun quartz, we have to sneak into a Cloud Beast den. We can't be careless at all. If they cause trouble and are discovered by the Cloud Beasts, not only will we fail the mission, we will also lose our lives."
Qin Sang replied: "I know very little about the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. I would like to ask Senior Apprentice Brother Mu to teach me on the way. I will definitely follow Senior Apprentice Brother Mu's instructions on this trip."
At the same time, Qin Sang also recalled the situation that Qi Yuan Shou had introduced earlier.
Dry sun quartz was a precious spiritual ore that contained dry sun energy. It was a necessity for refining some magic weapons that contained extremely yang energy. This spiritual ore was difficult to find in the Small Cold Region, and only a few scattered veins could be found in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
However, the spiritual ores in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield were occupied by Cloud Beasts, so it was not easy to mine them.
This dry sun quartz ore vein was not only hidden deep underground, but also had a huge Cloud Beast den above it. Within it, lived hundreds of thousands of Cloud Beasts. They were numerous and powerful. Even Golden Core cultivators had to avoid them, so it was impossible to openly mine the spiritual ores under the den. They could only look on with regret.
Unexpectedly, this dry sun quartz would 'grow' on its own.
This was not uncommon in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The spiritual materials and herbs deep underground were contaminated by the Cloud Beast's essence, and they would slowly emerge from the ground during the transformation process.
Before the Cloud Beasts completely transformed, the spiritual materials, herbs, and the Cloud Beast's essence had yet to fuse together. If they were captured, there would be a way to remove the Cloud Beast's essence and restore their original appearance. As long as the damage was not too great, they could still be used for refining weapons and elixirs.
Later, Xuan Lu Guan found a hidden path that could deceive the Cloud Beasts' senses, allowing them to quietly sneak into the ore vein. Every once in a while, they would send shadow guards to harvest it, and they would reap a good harvest.
The reason why ten shadow guards were dispatched at once was because not only was there dry sun quartz in the ore vein, but also possibly dry sun crystals!
Dry sun crystals could be used to refine magic treasures!
