<h1>Chapter 1026: A Deal</h1><p>After waiting for a while, the young woman, unable to contain her curiosity, stealthily moved towards the other presence.</p><p>She was extremely cautious, not daring to approach directly, continuously calculating the workings of the illusion formation.</p><p>Finally, to her surprise, she discovered that it was indeed a path leading out.</p><p>The young woman wasn't sure if the other person had noticed her.</p><p>She had two choices: either follow this path or calculate another escape route, as there was more than one way out of the illusion formation.</p><p>Following the other person might lead to an ambush.</p><p>Just then, a voice suddenly echoed from the nearby woods.</p><p>“Trapped in this illusion formation, we should each go our own way. Yet, fellow Daoist, you've been following me. What are your intentions?”</p><p>The young woman was startled, but surprisingly, she didn't retreat. Instead, she looked towards the source of the voice and calmly replied, “Fellow Daoist, please don't misunderstand. I've been trapped here for too long and grew anxious. Seeing that you'd found a way out, I hoped to benefit from your discovery. I didn't expect you to still be here.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, the voice spoke again.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, with a Life Talisman in hand, are you still afraid of a mere illusion formation?”</p><p>Behind an ancient tree, Qin Sang watched the young woman with a cold gaze.</p><p>He knew the commotion he'd caused while traversing the formation would likely be noticed.  He didn't want a tail, so he feigned departure, waiting to see if she would follow.</p><p>If she dared to follow, she wouldn't be leaving.</p><p>However, he was surprised by the young woman's identity.</p><p>Before the trial began, Old Man Mu had exchanged his own qualification for a Life Talisman, which he gave to this young woman.</p><p>Unsure of the Life Talisman's function, Qin Sang didn't act rashly.</p><p>An item sought by a Nascent Soul ancestor was certainly not simple and might possess power surpassing the Core Formation stage.</p><p>His caution proved justified.</p><p>Although the young woman was at the late Core Formation stage, judging by her aura, her strength wasn't exceptional. Yet, facing a potential ambush, she remained remarkably calm and confident.</p><p>This confidence stemmed either from a life-saving treasure bestowed by a Nascent Soul ancestor or the Life Talisman itself.</p><p>There was more than one portion of Soul Cleansing Liquid within the trial grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want a conflict and hoped to scare her away.</p><p>But the young woman showed no intention of leaving. She retracted her defensive posture and spoke, “Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand. While the Life Talisman can protect me, it's not very effective within this Thousand Mountains Formation. My current concern is how to escape this formation quickly, lest the treasure be claimed by others, rendering my Grandmaster's efforts futile.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and said coldly, “Whether you obtain the treasure or your Grandmaster's efforts are wasted has nothing to do with me.  Don't you think it's inappropriate to secretly follow me? You're my competitor. Do you expect me to help you?”</p><p>Hearing this, the young woman's lips curled into a slight smile.  She abruptly changed the subject and asked, “My name is Ming Wei. May I know how to address you, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>“My surname is Qin,” Qin Sang replied indifferently. “This is just a warning. Don't repeat this mistake. Don't force my hand.”</p><p>With that, he turned to leave.</p><p>Ming Wei's expression turned anxious.  “Wait, Fellow Daoist Qin! I have a proposition, a deal.  Please hear me out before you decide.”</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang paused. “What deal? Do you intend to hand over the treasure to me?”</p><p>“Hand it over? Absolutely not!” Ming Wei shook her head. “But we can cooperate. You've reached this point so quickly, demonstrating extraordinary ability.  You must also be interested in the Soul Cleansing Liquid, right? There's more than one portion. Why can't we work together? The disciples from those major sects came in groups. We're both fighting alone, at a significant disadvantage.”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, “While there's more than one portion, there won't be many. You can't even pass the Thousand Mountains Formation. I can leave you far behind by simply continuing forward.  Taking you along adds a competitor. What's in it for me?”</p><p>Ming Wei felt a surge of anger. She gritted her teeth and said, “I can pass it!  Calculating the changes in the illusion formation consumes too much mental energy and time!  If not for your proficiency with illusion formations, do you think I would need your help? If it weren't for this Thousand Illusions Formation, I would have left you in the dust!”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, why dwell on such hypothetical scenarios? There are no 'ifs' in this world.  Cooperating with you isn't out of the question, but what can you offer me?” Qin Sang stroked his chin.</p><p>“The Life Talisman isn't just for my use; it can protect you too! As long as it's activated within the trial grounds, no danger can harm us. Is that enough?” Ming Wei lifted her chin confidently.</p><p>“No danger?”  Qin Sang was inwardly shocked. No wonder Old Man Mu was willing to pay such a high price for the Life Talisman; he was paving the way for his descendant.</p><p>It seemed a single Life Talisman was almost equivalent to a portion of Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>“Indeed! We'll swear a Heart Demon Oath. You guide me through this stage, and in the final trial, we'll cooperate to obtain the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  In times of danger, I'll activate the Life Talisman to protect us. You know how dangerous the final stage is. But I have a condition…” Ming Wei's voice turned serious.  She paused, then continued, “If there are two or more portions of Soul Cleansing Liquid, we naturally won't have to fight. But if there's only one left, you must give it to me!”  Her tone was firm.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang flatly refused, “No!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“I'm confident in obtaining a portion even without you.  I want to see just how capable those sect disciples are,” Qin Sang sneered. “I'm only agreeing to cooperate as a precaution.  Handing over the Soul Cleansing Liquid is absolutely impossible.  However, we can agree in advance that if such a situation arises, our agreement is void.  Whoever gets the Soul Cleansing Liquid will depend entirely on their own ability. How about that?”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed to Ming Wei's proposal because he believed, as Old Man Mu's direct disciple, she was highly valued and likely knew more about the trial grounds than others. His own knowledge was limited, putting him at a disadvantage compared to the sect disciples.  Having Ming Wei's assistance would save him a lot of trouble.</p><p>His confidence stemmed from his strength.</p><p>Even with the Life Talisman, Ming Wei would be of little help when competing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Ming Wei nodded. “Fine, I accept your terms. Let's swear the Heart Demon Oath now. After leaving the Thousand Mountains Formation and entering the final trial, we'll meet at the agreed-upon location.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>After discussing the details, they made their oaths.</p><p>Ming Wei's expression relaxed as she looked towards the depths of the dense fog.  “You can show yourself now, Fellow Daoist. We should hurry.”</p><p>The fog stirred.</p><p>Wearing a mask, Qin Sang appeared.</p><p>They sized each other up and departed together.</p>
