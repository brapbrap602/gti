<h1>Chapter 1379:  The Transcendent Master Tianyue</h1><p>Chapter 1379:  The Transcendent Master Tianyue</p><p>“A Xuan Tian Palace traitor… I wonder what he’s done…”</p><p>The black-robed swordsman turned to Feng Shangshi, “Daoist Feng, your connections are extensive and your information impeccable. Have you heard anything?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Feng Shangshi shook his head. “A Yuan Ying cultivator defecting from Xuan Tian Palace… such a scandal, would the Palace widely publicize it? Besides, the Boundless Sea lies between us. Even if rumors reached us, it would be years later, distorted beyond recognition.”</p><p>The scholar in white chimed in, “Daoist Feng is right! What he did is unimportant; what matters are the secrets he holds. According to the demonic rat, a host of Xuan Tian Palace experts pursued him into the Demon Realm relentlessly, nearly alarming the Great Saint Tianpeng before grudgingly retreating. The traitor may have brought a treasure from the Palace, though the rat didn't specify what, either due to ignorance or concealment.”</p><p>The woman in a phoenix crown raised an eyebrow, alluringly,  “Something the Xuan Tian Palace considers a treasure…”</p><p>The black-veiled swordsman looked at Feng Shangshi, “The demonic rat is dead, but we are still outnumbered. Should we invite help?”</p><p>Feng Shangshi pondered for a moment.</p><p>“I’ve already contacted cultivators from the Star Sand Islands. The demon race seems aggressive, but their actions lack substance.  Bi Fang seems unwilling to fight; their show of force is a mere pretense to conceal their true intentions. We needn’t escalate matters; inviting too many people risks leaking information and causing more trouble.”</p><p>Pausing, Feng Shangshi continued, “I’ve already sent word to invite that mysterious cultivator. Let's wait and see.”</p><p>The scholar in white curiously asked, “Is this person from the Star Sand Islands? A mid-Yuan Ying cultivator proficient in lightning escape techniques cannot be unknown!”</p><p>Feng Shangshi shook his head, “I've inquired, and there's no record of such a person!”</p><p>At that moment, a streak of light flew into the hall.</p><p>Feng Shangshi caught the light, then smiled, “Speak of the devil! I’ll go meet him. Continue your investigation.”</p><p>…</p><p>Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in his secluded chamber, sensing something, and opened his eyes.</p><p>The chamber's protective formations were triggered.</p><p>Chu Huanqiang reported from outside, “Senior Mingyue, Master has returned to the mountain and awaits you in the main hall.”</p><p>Qin Sang left his chamber and followed Chu Huanqiang to the mountaintop, where he met Feng Shangshi.</p><p>Being fellow powerful cultivators, they exchanged pleasantries warmly. Qin Sang thanked Feng Shangshi for driving away Bi Fang, and Feng Shangshi showed solidarity, quickly becoming friendly like old acquaintances.</p><p>“Forgive my boldness, but I dare ask, Daoist Mingyue, from what mystical land do you hail?”</p><p>Feng Shangshi, without beating around the bush, went straight to the point, inquiring about Qin Sang's origins, “With your cultivation and abilities, you are one of a kind in the entire North Sea. I am unlearned, and have never heard of you.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then decided to be truthful, saying calmly, “I am from a foreign land.”</p><p>If he were only at the early Yuan Ying stage, claiming to have cultivated in seclusion and unexpectedly broken through, thus remaining unknown, would have been plausible.</p><p>A cultivator who only secluded themselves wouldn't reach the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>If Feng Shangshi investigated and found no information about him in the cultivation world, he would surely be suspicious; lies wouldn’t hold up.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of revealing his origins; it was inconsequential.</p><p>“A foreign land?”</p><p>Feng Shangshi was startled, pondering for a moment before suddenly recalling something, exclaiming, “Daoist friend, are you from the Beichen Realm?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, “Daoist Feng is indeed knowledgeable; you guessed right. Are there other cultivators from the Beichen Realm who have crossed the storm?”</p><p>Beichen Realm cultivators knew about the Three Realms of the North Sea.</p><p>This implied prior exchanges between the two regions.</p><p>There must be legends of the Beichen Realm in the Three Realms of the North Sea.</p><p>It was normal for Feng Shangshi to know about the Beichen Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang probed indirectly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Feng Shangshi shook his head repeatedly, “Legend says that thousands of years ago, the Beichen Realm's top expert, Transcendent Master Tianyue, crossed the sea alone, defeating North Sea experts with a single sword, warning the Three Realms not to set foot in the Beichen Realm, and severing contact between the two regions. Daoist Mingyue is the first cultivator from the Beichen Realm I've ever encountered!”</p><p>He spoke with surprise, observing Qin Sang as if he were a curious specimen.</p><p>His expression didn’t seem feigned.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that Chen Yan and the others hadn't appeared on Fengyang Mountain, perhaps deliberately concealing their whereabouts.</p><p>Transcendent Master Tianyue.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling this person's history.</p><p>He was the last great cultivator of the Beichen Realm before Elder Ye!</p><p>It was said that Tianyue was a reclusive cultivator, very low-key, with no descendants, and suddenly vanished, so there were few accounts of him. Qin Sang only learned of him when hearing other Yuan Ying cultivators discuss him.</p><p>“Defeating all the North Sea experts with a single sword…”</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with awe.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Transcendent Master Tianyue, remembered by only a few in the Beichen Realm, had such a formidable reputation in another realm.</p><p>Feng Shangshi’s expression turned solemn when he mentioned Tian Yue Shangren, clearly showing deep respect.</p><p>“No wonder there are so many masters in the North Sea, yet only Master Chen Yan has visited the Bei Chen Realm.  It turns out someone was silently guarding it.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of admiration.</p><p>Unfortunately, his knowledge of Tian Yue Shangren was limited.</p><p>It is said that this person originated from the desert, a prodigious talent with a detached nature, like a carefree hermit, wandering wherever he pleased.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren never publicized his ascension to Grand Cultivator.  It only became known to others through a chance encounter, spreading by word of mouth, but then he vanished without a trace.</p><p>There are many different stories about Tian Yue Shangren’s whereabouts.</p><p>Some say he perished in some hidden realm.</p><p>Many ancient hidden realms in the Bei Chen Realm are fraught with danger, even Grand Cultivators dare not be careless.</p><p>Others say he may have quietly broken through to the Transcendence stage, crossed the Storm Belt, and is now wandering the world.</p><p>Given his personality, it's quite possible.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, feeling curious.</p><p>So much time has passed, if Tian Yue Shangren hadn’t advanced to Transcendence, he must have perished. Besides Master Chen Yan, hasn't anyone else tried to go and see?</p><p>Feng Shangshi said, “Back then, Senior Tian Yue planted his sword at the Tip of Heaven, then disappeared, and no one dared to approach it since, not even the Xuan Tian Palace. Later, the demon race grew stronger, conquering most of the Star Sand Islands, and seizing the Tip of Heaven. Without the Tip of Heaven route, even if we wanted to reach the Bei Chen Realm, we are powerless. I once considered it, but after one attempt, I encountered incredibly chaotic turbulent currents and almost lost my way, so I had to return.  Latter generations are unworthy and don’t even know if the sword Senior Tian Yue planted is still there…”</p><p>Feng Shangshi sighed.</p><p>The Tip of Heaven is located in the northern part of the Star Sea Islands, a corner jutting out towards the Storm Belt.</p><p>It is said that there’s a relatively safe path leading to the Bei Chen Realm, but it’s only relatively safe; it still demands extremely high cultivation from those who attempt it.</p>
