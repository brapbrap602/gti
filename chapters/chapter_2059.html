<h1>Chapter 2050: Origin, Emptiness, Sage, Ancestor</h1><p>Merit.</p><p>It sounds quite similar to the Dao Court's merit, and even more convenient to use.  Exchanging Dao Court merit for treasures requires visiting the Heavenly Hub Institute or the North Star Exorcism Institute to find a Dao official for the transaction. But in Qian Prefecture, one simply establishes an altar on the spot, and the treasures arrive.</p><p>Could the Merit system be an imitation of the Dao Court?</p><p>Behind Merit, there must be an existence similar to a Divine Court, otherwise, such profound mysteries wouldn't be possible.</p><p>The Divine Court could accept vows, transmit Dharma, and summon deities. This one can transmit objects, and there should be other wondrous uses as well.  The methods are quite similar, yet the consequences are vastly different.</p><p>With the Divine Court's decline and the Dao Court forced into the Four Separate Domains, the Great Thousand World seems to have tacitly permitted Qian Prefecture to implement the Merit system.</p><p>“If Merit is as convenient as Fellow Daoist says, why not expand it, implementing it throughout the Eight Great Celestial Prefectures, and even all human territories?” Qin Sang asked, feigning a puzzled expression.</p><p>Master Songfeng chuckled, as if laughing at Qin Sang's naiveté. “Let's not discuss whether Merit has all benefits and no drawbacks.  It's said that to enter this system, one must have a strand of their vital essence extracted to be able to accept the Merit Dharma. Although it's only a strand of ordinary vital essence, and no inconveniences have been heard of, who can guarantee there are no hidden dangers?  Moreover, once we cultivators become accustomed to Merit, relying on it for everything, we will be controlled by it. At that time, wouldn't Merit, or rather the person controlling Merit, be able to reign supreme over all cultivators? We with low cultivation levels, the sky falling wouldn't be our concern. We can disregard it. But those powerful experts and great ones would never tolerate such a thing.”</p><p>“Just extracting a strand of vital essence?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. Qian Prefecture’s Merit and the Dao Court’s Divine Court indeed had many differences.  He didn't know what the so-called 'vital essence' specifically referred to. If it included Divine Sense power, he would absolutely not agree.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t as he suspected, there were countless mysterious and secret techniques in the Great Thousand World. Perhaps cause and effect would be generated as a result, unknowingly falling under someone else's control.</p><p>He felt that there was a great secret behind Merit, perhaps related to the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle conflict. He couldn't help but feel that his previous observations were too superficial, merely scratching the surface.</p><p>The two didn't chat for too long. Turning to the main topic, Master Songfeng began to describe the item he wished to refine to Qin Sang.</p><p>"I haven't named the spirit array yet, but there's a reference for the item it will suppress, which is our sect's Taiyuan Token. In the future, it will be named the Taiyuan Traveling Banner. If I fail to refine it this time, I’ll definitely be mocked by my senior brothers for a thousand years.  If I succeed, I’ll be able to mock them for a thousand years. Elder Qin, please be meticulous.”</p><p>Seeing Master Songfeng's serious expression, Qin Sang glanced outside the cave dwelling, sighing inwardly.  Indeed, it was good to have a powerful backing. He valued this rivalry with his fellow disciples more than anything. Some might call it a pure heart, but those cultivators from small sects and rogue cultivators could never possess such a mentality.</p><p>He also had a powerful backing, but currently, not only could he not rely on it, he was also implicated by it, walking on thin ice.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't seen the Taiyuan Token.  He listened carefully to Master Songfeng's description of the Taiyuan Traveling Banner's design, feeling that they had a seventy percent chance of refining it together. Upon learning this, Master Songfeng was overjoyed and immediately pulled Qin Sang towards the inner chamber.</p><p>An Earthfire Furnace had already been set up here, and all sorts of spiritual materials were prepared. Qin Sang stopped Master Songfeng from immediately starting the furnace and discussed the Taiyuan Traveling Banner with him further.</p><p>Master Songfeng already had a clear vision for this treasure. Qin Sang couldn't change the treasure itself, but he could offer suggestions on the refining method, greatly benefiting Master Songfeng, who exclaimed that he had found the right helper.</p><p>For the next period, firelight occasionally flickered within the cave dwelling, and tremors occasionally emanated from the island, arousing the curiosity of others. However, with the island-protecting grand formation activated, no one dared to intrude. After lingering for a while, they dispersed, later becoming accustomed to it.</p><p>One day, a burst of unrestrained laughter erupted from the cave dwelling. If not for the grand formation's isolation, it would have startled the entire Qiandie Divine Precipice.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the front hall with a smile, poured himself a cup of clear water, and savored it.</p><p>A moment later, Master Songfeng also emerged, exhaustion lingering between his brows, yet he was refreshed.  With a flick of his sleeve, a beam of purple-gold light flew out. “This gourd of Nine-Melody Earth belongs to Elder Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, seeing a purple-gold gourd.  Upon opening it, a rich earthy spiritual Qi rushed towards him.  Visible to the naked eye was a swirling mass of Primordial Yellow Qi—it was indeed Nine-Melody Earth!</p><p>"Many thanks, Master," Qin Sang bowed and put it away.</p><p>“If not for Elder Qin's full assistance, this treasure would never have been refined so easily. I should be thanking you,” Master Songfeng waved his hand, his eyes flashing. “I recall Elder Qin mentioning wanting to go to Lansha Prefecture?”</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>“I happen to have a letter to deliver to a fellow Daoist in Lansha Prefecture. Could I trouble Elder Qin to deliver it for me?” Master Songfeng asked.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. If it was just delivering a letter, Qiandie Divine Precipice certainly wouldn't lack channels for communication.  Why ask him, an outsider? This clearly had a deeper meaning.  Master Songfeng must be grateful for his help in refining the Taiyuan Traveling Banner and was using this as an excuse to introduce him to a Lansha Prefecture power, forming a beneficial connection.</p><p>Of course, this letter was just a stepping stone. How far he could go depended on himself, but it undoubtedly gave him an opportunity to invoke a powerful name.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang immediately agreed.</p><p>Master Songfeng channeled his True Essence, waved his hand, and wrote a letter, handing it to Qin Sang. The two then left the cave dwelling.</p><p>Seeing Master Songfeng excitedly going to show off to his fellow disciples, Qin Sang shook his head, summoned his escape light, and continued on his journey.</p><p>Without pausing midway, he smoothly arrived at Sleepless City.</p><p>Like other immortal cities in Kan Prefecture, Sleepless City was prosperous but lacked elegance.  The spiritual energy within the city was far inferior to that of Qiandie Divine Precipice.</p><p>Having previously exchanged letters with the two women, Qin Sang already knew where they were staying. He quickly found the place, seeing a mansion built by the side of a spiritual lake.  Backed by an immortal mountain to the north, facing the spiritual lake to the south, surrounded by willows on three sides and lotuses on four, although not a cultivation sanctuary, it was a rare tranquil spot in the city.</p><p>A plaque hung on the gatehouse, reading:  Ethereal Spirit Manor.</p><p>Arriving at the front of the manor, he saw the gate tightly closed, the manor seemingly empty. Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending out a beam of spiritual light.</p><p>The spiritual light triggered the restrictions, and immediately someone hurried out of the manor. It was Gu Ya.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Gu Ya was overjoyed. “Senior Qin, you’re finally here!”</p><p>The group entered the manor. Qin Sang didn't sense Su Nu's presence. “Su Nu isn’t here?”</p><p>Gu Ya said, “Senior Su Nu has been in Lansha Prefecture.  My cultivation is low, unable to assist Senior.  Senior instructed me to remain in Sleepless City to manage things, while she went to Lansha Prefecture alone to investigate, sending messages at intervals.  Half a year ago, Senior sent a talisman message, saying she had something to do, returning in six months to a year at most.”</p><p>Saying this, Gu Ya took out the talisman message and presented it.</p><p>Qin Sang read it, seeing that the letter didn't mention what the matter was, but he believed that with Su Nu’s wisdom, there was no need to worry about her.</p><p>He asked Gu Ya a few more questions, learning that she had stayed in Sleepless City the entire time, knowing very little about Su Nu's plans. He would have to wait for Su Nu's return to know how much information she had gathered.</p><p>Calculating the time, Su Nu should have news soon.  Qin Sang thought for a moment, deciding not to rush to Lansha Prefecture and wait a little longer.</p><p>He turned and entered the inner courtyard.</p><p>There was another inner lake in the courtyard, filled with abundant spiritual energy. On an island in the center of the lake, several young men and women, either sitting in a pavilion or cross-legged on stones, were cultivating some kind of incantation.</p><p>Seeing the group, the young men and women hurriedly stood up, forming a neat row. When the group boarded the island, they bowed and saluted. “Greetings, Ancestor.”</p><p>Following Gu Ya, the Ethereal Spirit Sect’s main branch had passed through many generations. She established a branch here but didn't take disciples, instead opening a manor in the name of Ancestor.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed an elderly man among the youths, also the one with the highest cultivation—a Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>“Senior instructed me to find some helpers, preferably establishing roots in Sleepless City, to serve as a point of contact in the future. After much thought, I decided it would be best to take a few disciples here, passing down a lineage and establishing a branch.  My own descendants are trustworthy, and it can also expand the sect.  Unsure of Senior’s intentions, I took the liberty of passing down the sect’s Dharma, establishing this Ethereal Spirit Manor, and teaching them the Dao of Refining.”</p><p>Gu Ya pointed to the old man and the young man beside him. “This grandfather and grandson are surnamed Peng.  Their family passed down a fragmented Dharma, through which they entered the immortal path. I saw that their aptitudes were not bad, so I took them both as disciples.  The others were also found and selected by me from various places.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. With the Ethereal Spirit Sect's lineage, he didn't need to make other arrangements. However, these juniors' cultivation levels were still insufficient. After settling down, he would need to send a powerful expert to oversee them.</p><p>“I have also studied the Ethereal Spirit Sect’s Dharma and benefited greatly. You should cultivate diligently and not disappoint your Ancestor.  Upon this first meeting, I shall impart a technique to you.  When your cultivation reaches a certain level, continuously study it and compare it with your sect’s Dharma. You should be able to comprehend its profound mysteries."  As Qin Sang spoke, he flicked his finger, several beams of azure light entering the foreheads of everyone.</p><p>Everyone trembled slightly, suddenly feeling a profound secret technique appear in their minds, far beyond their current understanding.</p><p>Seeing this technique, Gu Ya's face revealed a look of pleasant surprise, discovering that this technique was incredibly compatible with the Ethereal Spirit Sect's refining techniques. Many of the Ethereal Spirit Sect's Dharma relied on the Dao of Refining. Progress in refining greatly benefited one's own cultivation.  Perhaps this secret technique could help propel the sect's Dharma to a new level.</p><p>After ascension, the Ethereal Spirit Sect, like many sects from the Storm Realm, faced the awkward situation of greatly increased cultivation but a lack of Dharma to cultivate.</p><p>Due to the lack of ascended cultivators supporting the lower realm, even the renowned sects of the Storm Realm wouldn't possess Dharma exceeding the Nascent Soul realm. Of course, if someone brought out a Grand Inheritance from the Sword Pavilion, it would be a different story.</p><p>Gu Ya had always had this thought but hadn’t found the opportunity. Unexpectedly, Qin Sang thought of it first. She remembered that her Master had promised Qin Sang access to the Ethereal Spirit Sect's scriptures, sighing inwardly.  Because of that day's cause, there was today's effect.</p><p>"What I gave them was the first part. This is the second part," Qin Sang handed Gu Ya a jade slip.</p><p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect originally only had a Nascent Soul inheritance.  Creating this secret technique was a simple task for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but consider the future path of sects like the Ethereal Spirit Sect.  He couldn’t deduce Dharma for each of them individually.  He needed a universal strategy, giving those unwilling to accept a dead end in their cultivation path a choice, such as establishing altars to transmit Dharma and bestowing orthodox Thunder Department Dharma.</p><p>He didn’t only possess the Dao Court’s Thunder Department cultivation methods but also inheritances like the Azure Water Village. As long as it was Nascent Soul level Dharma, it was sufficient for cultivation in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Those lineages unable to achieve breakthroughs would only gradually fade into obscurity, dispersing like smoke.</p><p>Of course, Dharma wouldn't be bestowed for free. This way, he could subtly influence people and resolve internal strife.</p><p>Gu Ya composed herself, solemnly bowing. “Thank you, Senior, for bestowing the Dharma!”</p><p>Instructing the disciples to return to their cultivation, Gu Ya took out a storage pouch. "These are the spiritual materials that Senior Su Nu and I have acquired.  Senior Qin, please see if there are any omissions."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly inspected them, greatly satisfied. With this, all the spiritual materials for constructing the Thunder Altar and the Dharma Transmission Altar were gathered. Next, he could focus on searching for the Storm Realm.</p><p>After instructing Gu Ya to pay attention to Su Nu's messages and watching her leave, Qin Sang called the brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi forward.</p><p>He held a jade slip in his hand, containing information on the Deviant Tribes that Su Nu and the others had gathered over the years.</p><p>Pondering for a moment, Qin Sang looked at the two anxious brothers: "Cultivate your techniques here. Let me see what kind of Dharma your Ju Fu clan practices."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The two brothers didn't dare to refuse, sitting down on the spot and circulating their cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed briefly, already understanding in his heart.</p><p>The Ju Fu clan were born with thick arms bearing strange markings, possessing innate divine strength. Without cultivation, they could tear apart tigers and leopards by the time they reached adolescence. With a little cultivation, activating the divine abilities within their arms, they would undergo further transformations.</p><p>The Ju Fu clan, and even the entire Deviant Tribes’ cultivation, focused on these innate divine abilities.</p><p>This was different from the Demon Race's bloodline power. The Deviant Tribes’ innate divine abilities were often associated with a particular organ or body part.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Body Refining Scripture* drew upon Stellar Origin Essence to purify bloodline power, deepening the connection between the bloodline and the stars, birthing a Dharma Idol that resonated with a dim star in the heavens.  Bloodline power was more like a catalyst for refining Stellar Essence.</p><p>The Deviant Tribes firmly believed that the path of their ancestors was the true path.  Upon birth, each clansman inherited a sliver of their ancestor's origin, some prominent, some faint.</p><p>By continuously exploring their divine abilities, they could gradually approach their ancestors. Other practices, whether body refinement, breath cultivation, or even external objects, all served this goal. It could be said that their innate divine abilities were their Dao Foundation. The higher their cultivation, the closer they were to their ancestors, even transforming into their ancestors!</p><p>The Deviant Tribes' realm divisions were quite different from the human race, divided into four realms: Origin, Emptiness, Sage, and Ancestor, yet there were similarities.</p><p>The so-called Origin Realm referred to the initial origin, the meaning of nascent origin, corresponding to the human race’s Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Gold Core, and Nascent Soul realms. The Deviant Tribes’ Origin Realm was also divided into four stages. Origin Realm cultivation focused on oneself, just like human cultivators. Reaching the Nascent Soul stage was only touching the surface of the ‘Dao.’ They still needed to solidify their own foundation before they could undergo a qualitative change.</p><p>Reaching the Emptiness Realm was similar to the human race’s Nascent Soul realm, able to connect with the power of heaven and earth, reflecting upon their own divine abilities. This corresponded to the human race's Spirit Transformation and Void Refinement realms. It was said that they also possessed the ability to manipulate the world's Yuan Qi to enhance themselves, just like human cultivators.</p><p>The Deviant Tribes’ Sage Realm corresponded to the human race's Body Integration realm.  These powerful experts rarely traveled openly within the Deviant Tribe territories. What changes their cultivation underwent and what abilities they possessed, Su Nu hadn’t been able to discover.</p><p>As for the Ancestor Realm, it was equivalent to the human race's Grand Completion stage.  The Deviant Tribes believed that reaching this level allowed one to return to their true origin, transforming into their ancestor, hence the name Ancestor.</p><p>Like Grand Completion cultivators of the human race, even legends of Ancestor Realm cultivators among the Deviant Tribes were scarce. The world only knew of the existence of this realm.</p>
