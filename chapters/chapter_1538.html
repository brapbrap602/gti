<h1>Chapter 1529: Eight Sceneries (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1529: Eight Sceneries (4k)</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Everyone flew from the islet, intercepting the beast’s path. They arrived at a wide expanse of sea, suspended in mid-air, and began their preparations.</p><p>The elder in purple robes reached to his waist and produced a palm-sized jade pendant.</p><p>The pendant was milky white, smooth to the touch, flawless within, and without any markings or inscriptions— seemingly ordinary.</p><p>Soundlessly, the jade pendant left the elder’s palm and hovered before him.</p><p>Then, the elder's purple robes swelled slightly, emitting a purple glow, revealing countless mysterious thunder patterns, as if woven from pure threads of lightning.</p><p>A faint rumble of thunder echoed.</p><p>Suddenly, purple lightning surged wildly towards the elder's right arm.</p><p>The elder pointed at the pendant with joined fingers, the purple lightning condensing into an extremely intense point of light.  Using his hand as a brush and the lightning as ink, he swiftly drew a complex symbol.</p><p>The small rune contained interacting clouds and lightning, constellations aligned and ever-changing.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The rune merged into the jade pendant.</p><p>In an instant, the jade pendant glowed brightly with purple light, no longer ordinary, resembling a thunder jade born from heaven and earth, absorbing boundless purple lightning, containing terrifying power, held in reserve.</p><p>Meanwhile, the others spread out around the elder, each taking their position, taking out identical golden swords.</p><p>The golden swords were only palm-length, forged from dark gold.</p><p>Clearly trained together, their initial sword stances were identical, using the same sword technique.</p><p>“Swords up!”</p><p>With the sword stance complete, everyone shouted in unison.</p><p>Imbued with sword energy, the golden swords rang sharply, suddenly reversing their blades. The sword tips pointed towards the central purple thunder jade, the blades vibrating slightly with a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>At that moment, the elder in purple robes appeared above the jade pendant, sitting cross-legged in mid-air, muttering incantations.</p><p>At once, the sword energy and purple lightning resonated, two entirely different forces, yet harmoniously combined to form a spirit array, controlling all directions.</p><p>This was one of the renowned formations of the Central State Daoist sect—the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array!</p><p>At this time, the spirit array remained dormant.</p><p>The golden swords had vanished into the void, along with the others, concealed by the array, awaiting activation.</p><p>In the void, only the elder in purple robes and the purple thunder jade beneath him remained. The purple light flowed, sometimes transforming into a ball of lightning, sometimes reverting to the shape of a jade pendant, but the fluctuations were suppressed to a minimum.</p><p>At this time, the elder's attention wasn't on the purple thunder jade.</p><p>His right arm gathered purple lightning, while his left hand rested on his knee, palm facing the sky. A golden bead, engraved with Buddhist Vajra patterns, appeared at some point.</p><p>Having made all the preparations, the elder heard a thunderous roar from deep within the storm, the sound faint and distant.</p><p>They knew little about the ferocious beast.</p><p>Even with the sect's top experts present, mastering two top-tier formations, and having prepared escape routes, they dared not be complacent.</p><p>This was the first time the purple-robed elder had heard such a strange roar, indicating a new beast they had never encountered, making him even more cautious.</p><p>The roar grew closer, the beast lured by the bait.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the purple-robed elder quickly sensed something was wrong. The beast seemed to have changed direction mid-way, its roar becoming increasingly muffled.</p><p>Others noticed the anomaly.  The long-bearded Daoist materialized from the void, gazing into the distance.  A flash of inspiration struck him.  “This lure, though painstakingly found, has limited appeal to the beast. It’s certainly not as effective as fresh blood, a Nascent Soul… There might be a Nascent Soul cultivator nearby!  If we scare the beast away before it reaches the barrier after finally waiting for it, wouldn’t that be a waste of all our efforts?  The higher the cultivation, the stronger the attraction to the beast. Let one of us lure the beast back.”</p><p>“A passing cultivator?”</p><p>The purple-robed elder's expression shifted, about to rise.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist's figure flashed, blocking the elder.  “I'll go, Senior Brother must stay at the array’s core. Though my cultivation is inferior, I've mastered a few more escape techniques than you.”</p><p>The purple-robed elder pondered for a moment. “Very well, be careful, Junior Brother. It's not a crucial matter, simply scare the cultivator away, hunting the beast is the priority.”</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist nodded slightly, transforming into a streak of green light, breaking through the air.  His golden sword was temporarily entrusted to someone else.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Qin Sang was flying towards Central State with all his might.</p><p>The ferocious beast sensed something it intensely disliked ahead, instinctively preventing it from approaching, yet its hunger made it linger over the blood-like lure.</p><p>The beast was frenzied, uncaring of gains and losses, driven purely by instinct.</p><p>The closer it got to Central State, the more restless and erratic the beast became.</p><p>From its roars, Qin Sang picked up clues, further confirming his previous deductions.</p><p>The barrier protecting the cultivation world keeps away the monstrous beasts!</p><p>No wonder I’ve never heard of monstrous beasts attacking the North Sea. Without the barrier's protection, even if humans could withstand the storm belt, they would have long perished.</p><p>He didn't need to risk his life to escape.</p><p>Even with the Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn, being caught in the hurricane would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>It seems approaching the barrier drives the beasts away.</p><p>Qin Sang felt slightly relieved but didn't relax his vigilance, constantly watching the beast's movements.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, the closer he got to the Central Plains, the more agitated the beast became, its roars filled with restlessness, its movements erratic, its instincts clashing.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the beast and pushed forward.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A deafening roar shook the sky from behind.</p><p>The beast let out an unprecedentedly shrill scream.</p><p>The roar drowned out the storm, like a thunderbolt striking above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang felt a powerful energy surge behind him, appearing from nothing, brewing at an alarming rate.</p><p>In an instant, the chaotic elemental energy was stirred.</p><p>The beast was still some distance away, but Qin Sang felt it clearly: the beast was manipulating the elemental energy!</p><p>This is a power only achieved by Nascent Divinity cultivators.</p><p>Upon reaching Nascent Divinity, cultivators can begin to manipulate elemental energy.</p><p>This is a true transformation, a step closer to the Dao of Heaven.</p><p>With a thought, they can summon wind and rain, like gods.</p><p>The legendary terrestrial immortals are said to be Nascent Divinity cultivators; even powerful Soul Formation cultivators are far behind.</p><p>"A Nascent Divinity beast!"</p><p>Although Qin Sang had suspected it, facing this change of fate, he was still shocked.</p><p>Manipulating elemental energy isn't simply a marker for Nascent Divinity cultivators.</p><p>The beast's attack caused elemental energy to fluctuate wildly, seemingly invoking heavenly might.</p><p>Even from such a distance, Qin Sang felt a sense of impending doom, as if there was no place to hide in this world.</p><p>The feeling wasn't overwhelming, not to the point of being repelled or suppressed by Heaven, but the inexplicable pressure was undeniable.</p><p>Nascent Divinity cultivators are still learning, they can manipulate elemental energy, but not control it; they only utilize a fraction of its power.</p><p>Compared to Soul Formation cultivators, the difference is immense.</p><p>Even late-stage Soul Formation cultivators, wielding top-tier abilities and treasures, would naturally be inferior to a Nascent Divinity cultivator if they lacked the means to resist the pressure, feeling intimidated before the battle even begins.</p><p>This is the difference in realm!</p><p>This beast is the strongest enemy Qin Sang has ever encountered!</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace Demon Lord’s original cultivation base was undoubtedly higher than the beast's, but Qin Sang had no chance to face the Demon Lord directly.  The Demon Lord's divided soul, though powerful and overwhelming cultivators, was only defeated with Qingzhu sacrificing their life. But Qin Sang didn't feel this way when the Demon Lord attacked, indicating that the Demon Lord did not surpass the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had overestimated the beast, but now he realized he was too optimistic.</p><p>If not for the barrier of the cultivation world hindering the beast, he might have had no choice but to jump into any place that could help him escape, even if it was extremely dangerous.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A surge of thick blood energy erupted from the depths of the storm.</p><p>The threat Qin Sang felt came from this.</p><p>The surrounding world was stained crimson with blood; below was a sea of blood, with waves crashing against each other. The beast, scarlet red, floated in the bloody sea.</p><p>Its full form was impossible to see.</p><p>On the exposed parts of its body were four bloody holes, which were actually four giant eyes, irregularly positioned, all staring at Qin Sang's escape route, their madness mixed with greed.</p><p>Its skin was incredibly smooth, without scales, sticky, seemingly constantly oozing thick blood, emitting a foul stench and an eerie aura.</p><p>The conflict between its instincts drove the beast to desperation.</p><p>With a furious roar, the beast's speed exploded, plowing a bottomless trench in the sea. Then, its four giant eyes shot out crimson beams of light, forming a pillar of light ahead, exploding outwards!</p><p>Instantly, a crimson corridor appeared in the storm belt, piercing the void, connecting the beast and Qin Sang.  However, the blood light thinned considerably towards the end.</p><p>The threat approached.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed it, turning abruptly, his eyes filled with crimson.</p><p>A foul stench assaulted his nostrils, nauseating him.</p><p>Even across such a distance, the blood light's momentum was still astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced hastily, pushing his escape technique to its limit.</p><p>But the blood light seemed sentient, pursuing him relentlessly like a malignant tumor, faster than him.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>A crimson tide surged, like rolling thunder.  Qin Sang, moving with the speed of lightning, was nonetheless swallowed by the bloody torrent after traversing several storms.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>His external manifestation appeared just in time, unleashing a prepared secret technique.  A wave of cold energy shot towards the void behind Qin Sang, solidifying into a thick ice mirror.</p><p>With a loud ‘bang’, crimson and icy light clashed.  An explosion echoed, shaking both Qin Sang and his manifestation.  Then, a look of relief appeared on their faces.</p><p>The blood light's power wasn't as terrifying as it seemed; it had been weakened by the storms and was at its end.</p><p>Of course, even the lingering power of a Nascent Soul stage beast's attack wasn't to be trifled with. The ice mirror shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang had already activated his Ruyi Treasure Orb, shielding himself with a protective aura.</p><p>A tremendous roar followed, the golden light of the protective aura bursting forth as it collided with the bloody light, creating a sun of crimson and gold.  Qin Sang was flung towards the sea surface like an arrow from a bow, propelled by a powerful force.</p><p>Though seemingly battered, Qin Sang was unharmed; he hadn't even needed to use the demonic fire or the Sun God Tree. The blood light had proved to be all bark and no bite.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could celebrate, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The blood light, which had been dissipating, unexpectedly formed a vortex, its center directly over Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang froze.  The beast still had a trick up its sleeve, employing deception to conceal its true killing move.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, while the beast was ferocious, instinct guided its actions.  Perhaps it had accidentally used this ambush tactic before, successfully killing an enemy, and this action was now imprinted in its instincts.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The crimson vortex formed rapidly, distorting space as if to grind Qin Sang to pulp.</p><p>The sudden change left Qin Sang trapped.  He dared not use the Sun God Tree to blast his way out, for fear of being caught in the blast himself.</p><p>He remained calm.</p><p>His earlier judgment had been correct: the chaotic energies of the storm had weakened the beast's attack from such a distance. He was not yet doomed.</p><p>A fire lotus spun out from Qin Sang's brow, merging with the demonic fire from the magic banner. Years of refinement had greatly improved the Fire Seed Golden Lotus, allowing Qin Sang to control even more demonic fire through the lotus.</p><p>Simultaneously, his manifestation wielded the Jin Chen Sword, unleashing a hundred-zhang-long sword qi.</p><p>A demonic fire dragon plunged into the vortex. Its fiery body twisted, as if about to be torn apart by the crimson whirlpool.</p><p>Fortunately, the demonic fire was formless; even if shattered, it could reform instantly, allowing it to relentlessly assault the vortex.</p><p>The manifestation attacked half a beat later, its sword qi following the demonic fire, cutting into the gap it had created.</p><p>Working together, Qin Sang poured all his strength into the attack, unleashing his divine abilities to resist the vortex's pull and fight his way out.</p><p>Sensing the loss of its prey, the beast roared in fury.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>A long-bearded Daoist was rushing towards the scene, following the beast's roars.</p><p>"Hm? That person has been caught by a beast?"</p><p>Hearing the unusual roars, the long-bearded Daoist's expression changed, and he increased his speed, still keeping his aura suppressed.</p><p>Approaching the battlefield quickly,</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist finally saw the crimson light cutting through the storm.  While he couldn't see the combatants clearly, he sensed the blood light's power.  He clicked his tongue.  "Another Nascent Soul stage beast, indeed. This cultivator's cultivation isn't even in the later stages. It seems likely they'll perish..."</p><p>He waited in the distance, then heard the beast's furious roars.  He chuckled softly. "It seems they escaped.  Quite skillful! But I can't let the beast approach the cultivation world, lest it flee in fright. Otherwise, I'd let you tangle with it a bit longer and test its powers."</p><p>He stroked his long beard, drew a talisman in the air, pointed a finger, and sent the talisman flying towards the end of the crimson light, transforming into a sword.</p><p>Simultaneously, the long-bearded Daoist deliberately approached the beast, releasing his aura.</p><p>The beast roared with delight.</p><p>It sensed new prey, even more alluring than the previous one, and far from the aura it loathed and feared.</p><p>Without hesitation, the beast abandoned Qin Sang and turned towards the long-bearded Daoist.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist dared not get too close and turned to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang and his manifestation burst from the vortex, about to escape, when they saw the beast turn away. They were puzzled by the beast's sudden surrender.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>A green light flew towards them.</p><p>"A sword talisman! Someone's nearby!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted in surprise, and he immediately recalled the demonic fire.</p><p>The sword talisman hung in the air, radiating green light.</p><p>An unquestionable voice echoed from it.</p><p>"Eight Views Daoist Grounds. All unrelated persons, leave immediately. Consider yourselves warned!"</p>
