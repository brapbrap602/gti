<h1></h1><p>After entering Hanging Head Pass, the Nascent Souls observed for another month.</p><p>As they expected, the hurricanes and spiritual tides in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield showed no signs of calming down and had turned into storm belts.</p><p>Fortunately.</p><p>Whether it was due to the lingering power of the Ziwei Palace, or some other unknown reason, the power of the storms in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was much weaker than other storm belts, and there were strong and weak tidal variations.</p><p>The forces of the Northern Chen Realm cooperated to guard the pass, and the pressure was not as great as imagined.</p><p>When the tide was low, low-level cultivators with enough courage, and with sufficient preparation, could also leave the pass and seek opportunities in the outer periphery of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>However, it was no longer possible to venture as deep as before.</p><p>In comparison, the damage to the Abyss of Ruin was more severe, and even Nascent Soul cultivators dared not enter.</p><p>Boundless Valley was not spared.</p><p>Fortunately, only the inner valley was destroyed. The outer valley was impacted, but a portion survived. Jing Yu's cave abode and the Blood Lake disappeared together. From now on, she could only stay safely in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Taking this as an opportunity, the establishment of the Northern Chen Alliance met with almost no resistance.</p><p>Faced with this situation, the Little Cold Region no longer dared to harbor ambitions of monopolizing the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and voluntarily gave up its interests in the Seven Heroes Pass.</p><p>The Heavenly Demon Hill, the Little Cold Region, the Heavenly Hành Alliance, the Abyss of Sin, and the Northern Chen Great Desert—five great territories—rarely formed a defensive alliance, jointly guarding a secret.</p><p>The tendency of the world, after a long period of division, is toward unification.</p><p>Due to the existence of the Northern Chen Alliance, the cultivation world of the Northern Chen Realm ushered in a long period of peace in the future.</p><p>"The enduring spiritual tides have both advantages and disadvantages. Some extremely hidden ancient restrictions may be stimulated by the spiritual tides and reappear in the world. Perhaps there are Immortal Palaces comparable to the Ziwei Palace, with Ascension Platforms..."</p><p>In a small courtyard, Qin Sang and Bing Han, along with several other Nascent Souls, were discussing the Dao while sipping tea.</p><p>They occasionally looked up at the high sky. The spiritual tides constantly impacted the barrier, flashing incessantly.</p><p>The one who spoke was Xiang Qing.</p><p>He was a rising star with a bright future and placed great importance on the Ascension Platform.</p><p>In the future, the Nascent Souls of the Northern Chen Alliance would often explore the Ancient Immortal Battlefield together, seeking opportunities.</p><p>Bing Han's expression flickered slightly when she heard this, and she said, "It is already difficult for present-day cultivators to cultivate. Now, the largest treasure lands in the Northern Chen Realm—the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Abyss of Ruin, and Boundless Valley—have all encountered problems, making it even harder for our disciples to find opportunities. In this palace's opinion, the Northern Chen Alliance should add another rule: Nascent Soul cultivators must not plunder the Ancient Immortal Battlefield indiscriminately, and leave a path for future generations."</p><p>"That makes sense. Most treasures are already useless to us..."</p><p>Everyone chimed in with their thoughts.</p><p>After drinking a pot of tea, Qin Sang rose to take his leave.</p><p>"Where are you going, Fellow Daoist Qin?"</p><p>"Collecting Cloud Beast souls."</p><p>Qin Sang said, flying out of Hanging Head Pass.</p><p>He re-refined a batch of Beast King Banners, adding those he had seized from the Core Formation stage Witches, gathering eighty-one banners in total. With slight modifications, he could collect the souls of the Cloud Beasts.</p><p>The Cloud Beasts of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield were special creatures that appeared intermittently due to the spiritual tides. Now that the spiritual tides were unceasing, Cloud Beasts would become increasingly rare.</p><p>The following ten years.</p><p>The Northern Chen Alliance was established, and communication between the cultivation worlds of each region was unimpeded. The barriers between them gradually disappeared.</p><p>No one could convince everyone.</p><p>The Northern Chen Alliance did not have an alliance leader, but instead had a council of elders, who jointly decided major events in the Northern Chen Realm and balanced the interests of all parties. Qin Sang was also a member.</p><p>After finishing the affairs of the Northern Chen Alliance, Qin Sang began preparing for the establishment of his sect.</p><p>Until today, the grand ceremony was imminent!</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the various events that had occurred in the past ten years, gradually withdrawing his thoughts.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed, and two things flew out.</p><p>One was the eighty-one Beast King Banners, and the other was a futon-shaped magical treasure.</p><p>The futon was another treasure Qin Sang had prepared for the Green Goat Temple to safeguard the sect—the Mind Light Futon.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that the material used to weave the Mind Light Futon was not grass or wood. It shimmered with a faint blue light, as if it were refined from a type of crystal.</p><p>Its main material was a rare spiritual object called Illusion Light Crystal, which Qin Sang had exchanged for from a Nascent Soul in the desert.</p><p>The Nascent Soul talisman puppet's ability to seal soul shadows was due to the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>Bai later provided Qin Sang with an idea. After careful consideration and several attempts, Qin Sang refined the Mind Light Futon using Illusion Light Crystal, which had a similar effect of sealing soul shadows.</p><p>However, the Mind Light Futon was far inferior to the Nascent Soul talisman puppet.</p><p>Firstly, the Mind Light Futon could not devour soul shadows on its own. Qin Sang had to transfer them from the Nascent Soul talisman puppet.</p><p>Secondly, the number of soul shadows the Mind Light Futon could seal was limited, and they would become increasingly weak over time, until they completely dissipated. Qin Sang had no better way.</p><p>This was enough to prove that the Dao Manifestation Tree was indeed of extraordinary origin and could not be replicated.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had already transferred two soul shadows into it, both from the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Activating his divine sense to probe into the Mind Light Futon, the soul shadows inside were very stable. Adding one more would be the limit.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Nascent Soul talisman puppet.</p><p>There was a blood-red, water-droplet-shaped mark between the eyebrows of the Nascent Soul talisman puppet. This was also taught to Qin Sang by Bai, and it could conceal the fluctuations of the Dao Manifestation Tree, so as not to be seen by those with ulterior motives regarding the material of the Nascent Soul talisman puppet.</p><p>Even an immature and polluted Dao Manifestation Tree was a rare and precious treasure in the world, so caution was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the Beast King Banners aside and guided a soul shadow from the Nascent Soul talisman puppet into the Mind Light Futon.</p><p>The Mind Light Futon trembled a few times and then returned to calm.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door and went out, discovering Jing Yu. He flashed and flew into the pavilion.</p><p>The white cat tactfully retreated.</p><p>"I have kept Fellow Daoist waiting."</p><p>Qin Sang said with an apologetic expression.</p><p>Jing Yu sized Qin Sang up and down. "Your cultivation has improved very noticeably after this secluded cultivation. It seems you have refined a Corpse Flower Blood Amber?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He took out a pot of peach blossom wine and poured a cup for Jing Yu and himself.</p><p>Not much of the peach blossom wine, personally brewed by his Senior Sister, was left. He only brought it out when honored guests came to visit.</p><p>"I must also thank Fellow Daoist for that secret technique to purify Corpse Flower Blood Amber. After removing the blood poison, the Corpse Flower Blood Amber can be directly refined by cultivators like us. The process was quite smooth, and the improvement to me far exceeded my expectations!"</p><p>Qin Sang was beaming with joy, and his tone also carried a hint of delight. "If nothing unexpected happens, after refining all three Corpse Flower Blood Ambers, I should be able to touch the bottleneck of the mid-Nascent Soul stage!"</p><p>Jing Yu was well aware of the magical effect of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and was not surprised. She smiled gently and raised her wine cup. "Then I wish Fellow Daoist Qin an early breakthrough to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, shocking the world!"</p><p>To be able to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage within a hundred years of forming the nascent soul was extremely rare in the history of the cultivation world and could be called a peerless genius!</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her and raised his cup in a shared toast, without saying any words of self-deprecation.</p><p>Nor did he feel conceited in his heart.</p><p>Only with the help of the three Corpse Flower Blood Ambers and the soul shadow of the Dao Manifestation Tree was there a possibility of breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage. If he cultivated step by step, he did not know how long it would take.</p><p>The two put down their wine cups and talked about other things.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>The white cat returned, "Tan Yien sent someone to deliver an urgent letter, and also said that a friend of yours has come to visit and is waiting for you at the mountain gate."</p>
