<h1></h1><p>Disaster descended upon the Empty Spirit Sea.</p><p>In the horrified gazes of countless cultivators.</p><p>Fiery currents erupted, soaring straight into the clouds.</p><p>Some Golden Core cultivators who were too slow to escape were instantly swallowed by the fiery currents.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect was directly overturned by the fiery currents, and fragments of the remaining land were forced out of the sea, some fragments still bearing pavilions and pagodas, shining with Buddhist restrictions, but all were being swallowed by the fiery currents at an alarming rate.</p><p>The surrounding cultivators saw that there were still some figures rushing out of there.</p><p>Those Nascent Souls not only didn't perish, but each displayed their supernatural powers, not forgetting to snatch the treasures that were forced out by the fiery currents before they evacuated. In the urgency of the situation, they didn't care about the grade, grabbing whatever they could and retreating.</p><p>They swiftly moved away before the crimson fire aura completely erupted.</p><p>The fiery currents brought a crimson firestorm, spreading around at an alarming rate, descending upon the low-level cultivators in their horrified gazes.</p><p>Seawater evaporated.</p><p>Giant waves surged.</p><p>Large ships didn't have time to evacuate; some were overturned, some were instantly torn apart, and swallowed by flames.</p><p>Low-level cultivators with insufficient cultivation were directly blown away their flesh by the scorching storm, dying in horror, only remembering the warning that had been passed down in the cultivation world since ancient times before they died—do not approach the battlefield between high-level cultivators, especially between Nascent Souls.</p><p>For a time, tragic scenes continuously emerged.</p><p>In mid-air.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo didn't compete for the Pure Sea Sect's remaining treasures like the others; his pupils were pitch-black as he surveyed the surroundings like a hawk, but in the end, he couldn't find that suspicious figure.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of the Empty Spirit Sea.</p><p>This place was already outside the Empty Spirit Sea, and occasionally, one could see islands occupied by people, with many cultivators active here.</p><p>Two figures flew discreetly over the sea, seemingly guarding against something.</p><p>They flew for a while.</p><p>The surrounding area was boundless blue, and not even a deserted island could be seen nearby.</p><p>"Senior's water mansion is here."</p><p>One of them, a burly man with a rough appearance, observed for a moment, pointed forward, and then took the lead in flying forward, diving into the sea.</p><p>The person behind him followed closely.</p><p>These two were none other than Qin Sang and Tan Hao.</p><p>Now it was the fourth day after the great battle of the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>That day, after leaving the Pure Sea Sect, Qin Sang suppressed the injuries on his body and fled far away with Tan Hao without looking back, not stopping for a moment, not going to find Valley Master Mu, and not knowing how the Pure Sea Sect's matter was settled.</p><p>They were now looking for Ghost Mother's former cave dwelling.</p><p>Tan Hao had stayed there for a while when he followed Ghost Mother to the North Sea before.</p><p>This cave dwelling hadn't been discovered for so long, which showed its secrecy. Qin Sang could heal his injuries, sort out his gains, and organize what he needed to do next.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The two of them didn't dive far before they saw a hidden island under the sea.</p><p>Tan Hao tried to pinch a spell, and the center of the hidden island flickered with a faint light, which immediately transformed into a door.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Tan Hao and flashed in, finding that there were only a few stone rooms here, with very rich spiritual energy, but the furnishings inside were extremely simple, and some of them were empty.</p><p>"Senior Ghost Mother hasn't come back."</p><p>Tan Hao pushed open a few doors, checked, and replied.</p><p>"It seems she has indeed left the North Sea."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded without hope, casually chose a room, and was about to go in, when his footsteps paused slightly, "Brother Tan, how are your injuries?"</p><p>"After taking the spiritual pill, I'm already fine, thanks to Brother Qin for blocking the fiery currents," Tan Hao recalled the last encounter that day, feeling a little lingering fear, and a little excitement.</p><p>Because he cooperated with Qin Sang to successfully snatch food from the tiger's mouth in front of a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I remember you said that you used to be active nearby and have some contacts, so you shouldn't be suspected. After the storm passes, you go out to inquire about news; it's inconvenient for me to show my face for the time being. Well, take a look at any unusual movements of the descendants of Qi and Wang; they may be targeted by Old Devil Hunmo. Be careful not to contact them directly."</p><p>Qin Sang was still concerned about the Spirit Ascension Ritual, but didn't plan to visit Hundred Flowers Valley now.</p><p>Through the movements of the descendants of Qi and Wang, he could get a glimpse of the outcome of that great battle and whether anyone survived.</p><p>Three against two.</p><p>At the last moment, I also seized the opportunity to guide the power of the Thousand Buddha Wall, ambushing Old Devil Hunmo and buying them time. At least one of them could escape, right?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, "I'll go out in a few days."</p><p>"Also, help me inquire about people or forces in the Boundless Sea who are good at alchemy…"</p><p>Qin Sang considered the things he had to do later, and finally said, "Although your Subduing Demon Pestle is a Buddhist treasure, it's good that cultivators outside the Buddhist sect can also use it. Because it's a magic weapon that specializes in killing, its ability is single, but its power is improved instead. Although it's a high-grade magic weapon, once you completely refine it, it should be able to exert the power comparable to a top-grade magic weapon…"</p><p>The treasure pestle he snatched in the Buddhist hall was called the Subduing Demon Pestle.</p><p>Tan Hao's face was full of surprise when he heard this. With this magic weapon, after breaking through, he would be able to not fear those old-brand Nascent Souls.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's tone changed, and he smiled, "Let me keep it here for the time being, and see if I can change the form of the Subduing Demon Pestle. Otherwise, even if I give it to you, you wouldn't dare to use it in public, unless you're not afraid of being investigated by Old Devil Hunmo's claws (lackeys)."</p><p>Tan Hao thought of the consequences of being targeted by Old Devil Hunmo, and couldn't help but shiver.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang closed the door and set up a restriction.</p><p>He summoned the Nascent Soul Puppet. The puppet was charred, without obvious external injuries, but a large area of the puppet imprint had collapsed again.</p><p>After checking, Qin Sang clicked his tongue and said, "The puppet's injuries are comparable to when it was just brought out of the storm. Alas, following me, you've suffered."</p><p>Reaching out and stroking it, Qin Sang first put the Nascent Soul Puppet aside.</p><p>The Thousand Jun Ring flashed.</p><p>Streams of light fell on the ground like flowing water.</p><p>"This time is really an unprecedented harvest…"</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his hands, eagerly checking.</p><p>First of all, there were nine Myriad Spirit Fruits, placed separately.</p><p>The luster of the spiritual fruits was dim, but it didn't affect their effect.</p><p>"There are still quite a few to spare, but unfortunately, I haven't found the refining method of the Soul-Suppressing Incense…"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if it had been taken away by Ghost Mother. This thought flashed through his mind, and he opened the spirit beast pouch, summoning the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was curled up into a ball, the red light on its body seemed to be breathing, sometimes bright and sometimes dark.</p><p>The injuries caused by the Three Spirit Panwang Formation needed a long time to recover, and the Fire Jade Centipede had been listless these days.</p><p>Qin Sang opened a jade box, took out a Myriad Spirit Fruit, recalled the feeding method that Valley Master Mu had said, gently urged his true essence, and broke open the skin of the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>The juice, exuding a strong vitality, flowed out, with a refreshing fragrance.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede 'bang'ed, its body tightened and popped up, standing upright like a stick.</p><p>Qin Sang silently 'ha'ed, cast a few restrictions, refined it, and led a drop of juice to feed the Fire Jade Centipede, putting the rest into a jade bottle.</p><p>The effect was immediate.</p><p>The aura of the Fire Jade Centipede immediately stabilized a bit, and then it looked lazy, shrinking back into Qin Sang's palm, drowsy, and began to digest the spiritual medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang followed suit, refining two more Myriad Spirit Fruits, and feeding them to the Skyeye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm respectively.</p>
