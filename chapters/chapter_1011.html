<h1>Chapter 1003  A Long Time Apart</h1><p>Qin Sang followed the two women along the stone path.</p><p>Suddenly, a bright light appeared ahead, revealing a scene like a peach blossom paradise.</p><p>Flowers bloomed in profusion, waterfalls cascaded down.</p><p>Young women danced among the blossoms, surrounded by fluttering bees and butterflies.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, feeling his mood lighten considerably.</p><p>He had once considered, if he were not to pursue the elusive immortality, finding a secluded haven like this to spend his remaining years would also be a fulfilling life.</p><p>“Our sect has been in decline for some time, and even Master, as the sect leader, only reached the late Foundation Establishment stage.  After Master passed away, we set up an additional defensive array and took in some new disciples. Our sect is rather impoverished, please forgive our humble state, Daoist Master.”</p><p>Wang Shi gently tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, smiling faintly.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Wang Shi, feeling that she was different from before, as if she had undergone some transformation, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</p><p>Under the curious gazes of the young women, Qin Sang followed the two sisters into a bamboo building.</p><p>“These disciples are quite talented; you two have worked hard.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the Wang sisters’ sect only had female disciples, and a smile played on his lips.</p><p>Wang Xiang, flitting about, first offered spiritual tea, then brought out a pile of spiritual fruits, claiming they were delicious, urging Qin Sang to try them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony, conversing with the two women, recalling past events.</p><p>“By the way, Fei You warned me before we parted, I wonder if he's been here?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Wang Shi smiled gently. “It's a testament to the two senior's loyalty to Daoist Master that Fei You was so thoughtful. Fei You didn't return himself, but he managed to send a message, letting us know that the Daoist Master's strength far surpasses our imagination.”</p><p>Wang Shi's beautiful eyes flickered, a hint of doubt in them. “Fei You said the Daoist Master had several late Nascent Soul stage experts following you. Where are the others?”</p><p>“Fei You exaggerated a bit.  You’ve both met the two-headed… beast. Its power has greatly increased; it truly could fight late Nascent Soul cultivators. One of them was just a physical manifestation of myself. The other was not following me, just happened to be there and offered assistance. However…”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile. “After Fei You left, I was attacked by Old Devil Mu. First, my manifestation self-destructed, then I was forced to release the two-headed… beast before barely escaping with my life…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly recounted the events, causing the two women to gasp repeatedly, their faces filled with worry.</p><p>Being hunted by Old Devil Mu, suffering heavy losses.</p><p>Qin Sang had no one to confide in, and today he finally released some of his pent-up frustration.</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, his voice low and serious. “Old Devil Mu might still be alive. He’ll definitely continue searching for me. You and Fei You must be extremely careful and never reveal your true identities.”</p><p>Wang Shi was startled. “With experts from both righteous and demonic paths gathering to hunt on Tianfeng Island, Old Devil Mu actually managed to escape?”</p><p>Wang Xiang was both shocked and angry. “That old devil deserves to die! Luckily, my sister and I were cautious and concealed our identities whenever we went out.”</p><p>“Old Devil Mu’s cultivation is second only to Grand Cultivators, and his methods are bizarre, placing him among the top Yuan Ying ancestors in terms of strength.  Escaping death isn’t impossible.”</p><p>Qin Sang then asked about Ran Luo's whereabouts.</p><p>After hearing Wang Shi’s account, he learned that after the great chaos in the Demon Sea, Zou Lao became disheartened and withdrew from worldly affairs.  Ran Luo, along with several others from the Demon Sea, soon left the merchant guild and went their separate ways.</p><p>They still kept in touch.</p><p>After receiving Fei You’s warning, the Wang sisters immediately contacted Ran Luo, who had hidden herself in time and was now safe.</p><p>After their chat, Qin Sang learned that the Wang sisters were not doing well.</p><p>They knew their chances of forming a Nascent Soul were slim, and most of their savings from the Demon Sea had been used to develop their sect.  This incident made them even more hesitant to go out and seek opportunities.</p><p>They couldn't afford pills to cleanse themselves of demonic煞气 (sha qi), and they didn't even have any treasure weapons.</p><p>Wang Shi was still using the jade tablet Qin Sang had given her years ago.</p><p>They had collected some materials for refining magic weapons, but couldn't bear to commission a skilled refiner.</p><p>“Show me the materials you’ve collected.  Since I’m free, I’ll try and refine some magic weapons for you.”</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The two women looked overjoyed. “Thank you, Daoist Master.”</p><p>They had never seen Qin Sang refine magic weapons before, but they had no doubt about his ability.</p><p>After clarifying the sisters’ requirements, Qin Sang went to the nearest market town from Lingchun Island and rented a refining room.</p><p>Although this wasn't his first time refining magic weapons, Qin Sang remained extremely cautious.  He needed to not only succeed in refining them, but also ensure they were compatible with the sisters, to be used as their treasure weapons.</p><p>Because they were only low-grade magical artifacts, the bones and hides of  妖丹-stage demonic beasts could be used as refining materials. Qin Sang added some, slightly improving their power.</p><p>Shortly after,</p><p>two magical artifacts were completed.</p><p>Returning to the bamboo pavilion,</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, and two beams of light shot out, floating in mid-air, flickering uncertainly, revealing a beautiful hairpin and a delicate flying sword.  Not only were they powerful, but also exquisitely crafted and pleasing to the eye.</p><p>Seeing the artifacts, the two women were immediately captivated.</p><p>"This hairpin is mine!"</p><p>Wang Xiang grabbed the hairpin, unable to put it down.  She giggled happily for a while, then fastened it in her hair, dancing before a mirror, admiring herself.</p><p>Wang Shi gently stroked the flying sword, feeling it resonate with her, and she became lost in its beauty.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Wang Shi's cheeks flushed, and she bowed deeply to him.  "Thank you, Daoist Master.  We cannot express our gratitude enough; we sisters will always remember your kindness."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "I don't have many friends in the Canglang Sea. These two artifacts are a small token of my appreciation.  This parting may be for a long time, perhaps forever.  Take care, my friends."</p><p>"Are you leaving already, Daoist Master?"</p><p>Wang Shi sensed a change in Qin Sang's tone and her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>Wang Xiang stopped dancing, her brow furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the two women two masks he had specially crafted to conceal their appearances and auras.  Then, rising to his feet, he bowed and, without hesitation, strode out.</p><p>The two women quickly followed.</p><p>At the stone wall exit,</p><p>Qin Sang turned to bid farewell to the women, summoned his Jiao soul and flying vehicle, and soared into the sky.</p><p>A long time passed.</p><p>Wang Xiang softly said, "Sister, let's go home."</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>…</p><p>Flying over the boundless sea,</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the clear blue sky.</p><p>This wasn't his first such farewell, and he knew there would be many more.</p><p>More than a hundred years had passed since he left Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>He wondered how many of his old friends were still alive, and how many had already turned to dust.</p><p>A separation of worlds.</p><p>However, reflecting on it, he realized he hadn't made many true friends in the Canglang Sea; perhaps he had more enemies.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly, dismissed his thoughts, and focused on the road ahead.</p><p>He traveled almost non-stop, returning to Tianxing Island.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang remembered the stories he'd heard about the Four Saints. He paused to pay his respects at Mount Four Saints before heading towards the teleportation hall.</p><p>Teleporting to Da Huang Island, he went to buy the latest nautical charts.  Ordinary demonic beasts posed no threat to him. To master the Killing Talisman, he needed to venture deep into the demon sea and find stronger opponents.</p>
