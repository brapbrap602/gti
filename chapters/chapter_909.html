<h1>Chapter 901: Breaking the Formation</h1><p>That night, during the siege against the夔 Dragon, the mysterious figures, eager to rescue the creature, unleashed a devastating lightning attack from afar, pushing Qin Sang and his companions to the brink of death.  Qin Sang first barely escaped the barrage, then, his identity exposed, faced an ambush by Black Serpent Mountain cultivators.  With danger at every turn, he was forced to flee and couldn't get close enough to the mysterious rescuers to see their faces.</p><p>He now wondered if the cultivators who wielded the lightning magic were the same disciples expelled from the Orchid Cauldron Sect's Ox-Head Peak.  Otherwise, why were they so secretive and unknown?</p><p>Back then, the mysterious cultivators were tricked by a young man surnamed Fang into revealing their lightning techniques, subsequently trapped and likely killed by the Black Serpent Mountain's Beast King Banners.  Their fate couldn't have been good – complete annihilation, or perhaps a few were captured alive.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, connecting the events he'd experienced recently. However, these were merely speculations. Only by seeing those individuals' faces could he confirm his suspicions.</p><p>If it truly was Black Serpent Mountain, what was their purpose?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, recalling the pool discovered by his Skyeye Butterfly tracking the Gu worm.  Concerned about the butterfly's safety in the perilous Dark Thunderwood Forest, he concealed himself and silently slipped into the woods.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang arrived, the flag formation Zhao Songqiao had set up was steadily corroding Brightmoon Island's grand protective formation.</p><p>Within the black, eerie smoke, the silhouette of a Gu worm flickered in and out of sight as it lunged into the white mist, attempting to open a passage.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside Brightmoon Island…</p><p>On the other side of the entrance, the sea appeared calm, with only gentle ripples disturbing the surface.</p><p>A cultivator with sufficiently high cultivation would have sensed that this tranquility was a facade, a disguise created by some illusionary technique.</p><p>Hidden within the illusion were several strangely dressed cultivators.</p><p>Above their heads floated a mirror, the source of the illusion.  However, their focus clearly wasn't on maintaining the disguise, so the illusion was crude, just enough to conceal their presence and prevent discovery.</p><p>They controlled black flags, arranged in a formation identical to the one Zhao Songqiao had set inside, but significantly more powerful. This formation relentlessly assaulted Brightmoon Island's defenses.</p><p>These black flag formations seemed to resonate with each other, coordinating internally and externally with remarkable efficiency and devastating power.</p><p>Within the black smoke, ferocious beasts seemed to materialize, baring their fangs and fearlessly charging into the white mist.</p><p>The surrounding space, tainted by the black smoke, transformed into countless sharp weapons, tearing through the white mist and shattering the densely packed runes of the grand formation.</p><p>"Faster!"</p><p>The black-robed man, their second senior brother, urged anxiously.</p><p>The others remained silent, not daring to slacken their efforts.</p><p>Their eldest senior brother, accompanied by only two Blood Flood Dragons, was single-handedly facing numerous Core Formation cultivators.  No one knew how long he could hold out.  If Elder Lu broke free, all their plans would crumble.</p><p>'Hiss…'</p><p>The black smoke grew denser and more potent, shifting and morphing, manifesting swords, spears, and halberds that ceaselessly bombarded the white mist.</p><p>Finally, the mist thinned, the runes shattered, and a passage began to form.</p><p>Inside the grand formation, Zhao Songqiao looked up, his hands tightly clasped, his expression a mixture of hesitation and apprehension.  He seemed to be grappling with an internal conflict.</p><p>In the end, he chose to stay.</p><p>At this point, there was no turning back.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A muffled sound startled Zhao Songqiao, and he looked up sharply.</p><p>The white mist was finally pierced by the black smoke, and several figures emerged, landing swiftly before him.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's heart pounded.  The terrifying aura emanating from these individuals filled him with dread.</p><p>Then, he finally saw the familiar face he'd been waiting for.  Hope flickered in his eyes as he rushed towards the man, ignoring the others, and knelt. "Junior pays respects to Senior Xue and all other seniors."</p><p>This man was none other than the shopkeeper Xue from Skyrise City.</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue glanced at the black-robed man.  The latter surveyed the surroundings and nodded.  "This is indeed the Dark Thunderwood Forest, and the Thunder Cave lies below.  You've done well, junior."</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue smiled faintly. "Rise.  It seems you've been diligent.  These are for you.  Wait outside. Cultivate well.  I was once sworn brothers with your ancestor, and I wouldn't want his lineage to end."</p><p>With that, Shopkeeper Xue tossed a jade bottle containing several pills to the black-robed man.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's eyes lit up with excitement, his hand trembling as he clutched the bottle.</p><p>"Alright, go to the Thunder Cave now. Tenth Junior Brother can't maintain the flag formation for much longer.  Although we obtained the jade talisman from the Ox-Head Peak outcasts, no one knows if the Orchid Cauldron Sect has altered the Thunder Cave's restrictions.  It might take some effort…"</p><p>Urged by the black-robed man, the group followed the Gu worm towards the pool.</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue looked back as Zhao Songqiao left through the passage in the black smoke.</p><p>The black-robed man noticed his gaze and said calmly, "Don't worry, Junior Brother Xue.  I've instructed Tenth Junior Brother to only erase Zhao Songqiao's memories of these events, not to harm him. After all, Master has said this item is very important, perhaps a Witch Clan treasure.  If word gets out, it could bring disaster upon Black Serpent Mountain.  You understand, Junior Brother Xue."</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue's heart tightened, and he quickly explained, "I understand, Junior Brother. I was simply reminiscing about the times I spent with his ancestor."</p><p>The black-robed man offered no further comment and continued, "Rewards and punishments are Master's rules. This applies not only to Zhao Songqiao but also to you, Junior Brother.  Although Fourth Junior Brother met with an unfortunate accident, your contributions to the sect are clear to me, and I've already reported them to Master.  Upon our return, Master will reward you."</p><p>"Thank you, Second Senior Brother!"</p><p>The worry in Shopkeeper Xue's eyes lessened.</p><p>The Dark Thunderwood Forest was vast, but for Core Formation cultivators, the distance was insignificant.  As they spoke, they arrived at the pool.</p><p>The Gu worm buzzed and flew into the black-robed man's embrace.</p><p>He stepped to the edge of the pool, his eyes flashing as he peered into its depths.</p><p>Then, a small jade talisman appeared in his hand.  He muttered a silent incantation and tossed the talisman into the water.</p><p>As the talisman entered the pool, a whirlpool suddenly appeared.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The whirlpool grew larger, and the joy that had just appeared on the black-robed man's face froze.</p><p>The stone steps that should have been at the bottom of the pool were gone.</p><p>"It has been altered!"</p><p>The black-robed man's gaze darkened.</p><p>The others gathered around, staring at the pool.  One of them spoke, "The talisman still works, which means the original restriction remains.  They've simply added a new layer."</p><p>The black-robed man nodded. "It seems we can't avoid alerting them.  We'll have to break the restriction by force.  Retrieve the Beast King Banners, form the array.  Quickly!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Following his command, everyone retrieved their Beast King Banners.</p><p>Their cultivation levels varied, as did the number of banners they controlled.  Together, they held fewer than eighty-one, but their combined power was still formidable.</p>
