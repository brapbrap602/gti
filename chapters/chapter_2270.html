<h1>Chapter 2260:  Su Wen</h1><p>As Qin Sang left the stone bridge, the flames and icy wind behind her subsided.</p><p>She turned her head, glanced back, and closed her eyes slightly, contemplating her recent gains.</p><p>The "Water and Fire Harmony" chapter and the stone bridge trial complemented each other perfectly, resulting in significant progress for Qin Sang.  Subsequent trials were unlikely to yield such substantial rewards.</p><p>Simply traversing the stone bridge had further advanced her cultivation, but this was secondary.  The most important gain was the enhanced understanding of the Dao, smoothing her path forward.</p><p>Standing still, Qin Sang carefully contemplated this before looking ahead to the next challenge.</p><p>The end of the stone bridge rested on a white cloud, but beyond the cloud was endless void, with no foothold in sight.</p><p>The sight before her evoked only one feeling: emptiness.</p><p>Above stretched a boundless, cloudless sky.</p><p>Below lay an endless abyss, its depths unfathomable.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  Since stepping onto the cloud, she'd received no guidance. What was the nature of this trial? Or perhaps this was a safe zone between two trials, with the next one further ahead?</p><p>Instead of rashly leaving the cloud, Qin Sang stood with her hands behind her back, remaining motionless.</p><p>Soon, she turned her gaze to her left.  At the edge of the void, a light appeared—like the dawn before sunrise.  The instant it appeared, it was dazzling, awakening all things from their slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as she gazed at the light.  It grew increasingly brilliant; a golden glow emerged within the red, and then a massive fireball ascended from within the light.</p><p>"The sun?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew this wasn't a real sun, but a fireball conjured by the formation's power.</p><p>The flames burning on the fireball's surface were clearly visible to the naked eye, radiating intense heat that far surpassed a real sun's.  Any beast present would have instantly been charred.</p><p>Waves of heat washed over her, but Qin Sang remained unmoved, watching the "sun" arc across the sky.</p><p>As sunset approached, Qin Sang showed an expression of "as expected."  As the fireball descended and the light faded, a brilliant blue glow appeared in the west.  Then a blue sphere slowly rose. Unlike the moon in the outside world, this was an ice sphere, hanging high in the sky, exuding biting cold.</p><p>In an instant, extreme heat turned to extreme cold.</p><p>The sun and moon are known as the sun and the yin, respectively.  Clearly, the fire and ice spheres were mimicking the sun and moon of the world; their cycle was equivalent to a day and night in the outside world.</p><p>As the ice sphere descended, the fire sphere rose to replace it.  This cycle continued ceaselessly.</p><p>Where was the challenge in this trial?</p><p>Qin Sang fell into thought, her eyes tracking the rotating fire and ice spheres.  A subtle understanding dawned on her. Finally, she stepped off the cloud.</p><p>After only one step, Qin Sang stopped again, waiting for the spheres to complete three cycles before taking a second step.</p><p>This second step was not only forward but also slightly upward.</p><p>She paused again, then took a third step, a fourth...</p><p>Invisible steps seemed to exist in the void. Qin Sang ascended step by step, reaching the heavens.</p><p>At last, Qin Sang reached the summit, just as the fire sphere passed overhead.  The terrifying flames licked at her body.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and, like a moth to a flame, plunged into it.</p><p>Then, a human-shaped outline appeared on the surface of the fireball, descending into the abyss along with it.  When the ice sphere rose, the outline reappeared on its surface.</p><p>She followed the fire and ice spheres, participating in their rotation and alternation, and over time, not only was she not burned or frozen, but she gradually moved into their interior.</p><p>Until, she entered the very core of the fire and ice spheres, even becoming their core.  Suddenly, all fell silent.  Qin Sang blinked, realizing that she had left the spheres and had arrived at the end of the second trial.</p><p>Looking back, the void behind her was calm once more, ready for the next entrant, when the fire and ice spheres would reappear.</p><p>"Yin and Yang rotation, you within me, me within you..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly. Everyone understands the principle, but only through personal experience can one grasp the profound mystery of the Dao and apply it to their cultivation.  This formation had provided her with this invaluable experience.</p><p>After a brief rest, she pressed onward, embracing the next challenge.</p><p>The formation showcased the Dao of Yin and Yang in countless ways and from various perspectives, tailored to her, all within the imagery of fire and ice.</p><p>With this 'master,' Qin Sang's understanding of the Dao advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang's mastery of the Water and Fire Harmony chapter had reached the late Yuan Ying stage, steadily progressing towards the Hua Shen stage.</p><p>Qin Sang faced a challenge. The grand array tested not only talent and skill but also cultivation level.</p><p>The best approach was to cultivate while navigating the trials. Qin Sang was confident he could overcome all the tests, but the Water-Fire Harmony chapter wasn't the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*. Even with accelerated cultivation, there were limits.  Omens suggested he didn't have much time.</p><p>To quickly uncover the secrets of Mount Yuji, forceful entry seemed the only option.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with determination. He had previously deduced this plan's feasibility.  He'd already gained the array's acceptance, essentially becoming a semi-master.  Forceful entry wouldn't mark him as a target for destruction. His perception as a Nascent Soul cultivator made it achievable.</p><p>However, his current strength was insufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed that after reaching the late fifth stage of *Heavenly Demon Transformation* , combined with his mastery of the Water-Fire Harmony chapter, he could break the array.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang had already declared to the mysterious Azure Luan his ability to refine the sacred artifact. For realism, he needed another ten years.</p><p>Ten years was but a blink for a cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed on Mount Yuji, dedicating most of his efforts to breaking the array and cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony chapter.</p><p>Ten years later.</p><p>*Heavenly Demon Transformation* reached its late fifth stage naturally.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the final trial. He'd attempted three times, failing each, but progressing further each time, his confidence growing.</p><p>He'd determined the array's limits. A pure practitioner of Yin-Yang Dao, reaching roughly mid-Divine Transformation stage, could pass all tests and become master.</p><p>Qin Sang's mastery of the Water-Fire Harmony chapter fell short of Divine Transformation, forcing him to rely on strength for the later trials.</p><p>Gazing at the ever-changing spectacle, Qin Sang's eyes deepened. His gaze shifted, suddenly focusing on something.  He moved swiftly.</p><p>Majestic mountains, peaks clustered like a sleeping dragon.</p><p>Deep forests, ancient trees towering, guarding the sacred mountain through ages.</p><p>Intertwined branches cast dappled light on mountain streams. Water flowed gently; a waterfall cascaded like a silver river, imbued with ethereal essence.</p><p>Suddenly, a rainbow bridge descended from the heavens. A figure walked down.</p><p>"Is this the true face of Mount Yuji?"</p><p>Standing on the bridge, Qin Sang surveyed this hidden realm.</p><p>He'd passed the final trial, immediately gaining acceptance as Mount Yuji's master, granting free passage.</p><p>As expected, the true Mount Yuji was abundant with spiritual energy, an ethereal atmosphere. It was not only a cultivation paradise, but vast and resource-rich; Qin Sang spotted several rare spirit herbs.</p><p>The place was suitable for a large sect's headquarters, but contrary to expectations, it was deserted, devoid of buildings, just dense forests.</p><p>"Was Mount Yuji never a renowned sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang realized why he found no records. This was a hidden sect, perhaps not even a sect at all. Even a small number of disciples would leave some trace of buildings.</p><p>Instead of buildings, only an octagonal stone pavilion stood atop the main peak.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the pavilion, seeing a stone table and two stone stools.  A goban was etched on the table, with pieces arranged in an unfinished game.</p><p>The scene evoked a mental image: two players mid-game, interrupted by urgent matters, never returning.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the game, a thought striking him.</p><p>The pieces emitted bright light, beams shooting into Qin Sang's mind.  The goban and pieces vanished, replaced by dancing jade plaques.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, countless profound characters flooding his mind.</p><p>He found the Water-Fire Harmony chapter and a partial version of *The Four Qi Regulation Treatise*.</p><p>"Su Wen…"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered, awe washing over his face.</p><p>He'd obtained a scripture: the *Su Wen Classic*!</p><p>This scripture belonged to the Yin-Yang Dao, but was far more encompassing than he'd imagined.</p><p>The Water-Fire Harmony chapter was part of *The Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence*, which was itself just a part of the *Su Wen Classic*.</p><p>The scripture was profound, explaining the Yin-Yang Dao through countless phenomena. The Water-Fire Harmony chapter was one; *The Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondence* contained several others, similar to the Water-Fire Harmony chapter, using other natural phenomena for cultivation.</p><p>The *Si Qi Tiao Shen Lun* appears to be a manual for self-cultivation, but mastering it allows one to comprehend the principles of Yin and Yang.  Other texts, such as the *Wu Zang Sheng Cheng Lun* and *Wu Zang Bie Lun*, equate the five internal organs with the five celestial organs, focusing on cultivating their Qi to harmonize Yin and Yang.  All these texts share a common underlying principle.</p><p>These texts are not sequential but parallel paths to enlightenment.  Cultivators needn't worry about gains and losses; they can choose a path based on their aptitude and circumstances, branching out later as their cultivation progresses.  Different paths lead to the same destination:  understanding the Dao of Yin and Yang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly read through the text, realizing it directly points to the realm of  "Refining Emptiness and Merging with the Dao," equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage in later eras. Whether it includes content beyond that stage, he couldn't say, as the most advanced sections were beyond his comprehension.  True teachings become concise at higher levels, often reduced to a single, cryptic sentence.</p><p>However, it's certain that with sufficient talent, reaching the Nascent Soul stage using this text is achievable.</p><p>“It’s at least a Nascent Soul-level cultivation method!”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, but also slightly disappointed. The Wu Lei Shi Yuan seal is incomplete; the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* is also unfinished; and the bone flute may contain the complete *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, but with significant risks.  In a sense, this *Su Wen Jing* is perhaps his greatest gain from the illusionary realm. If the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* and *Tian Yao Lian Xing* prove unworkable, this text serves as a backup.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Sang doesn't plan to switch to the *Su Wen Jing*.  Firstly, the path forward with the *Zi Wei Sword Scripture* is clear; secondly, the *Su Wen Jing* is too vast and complex.  This is the source of his disappointment.</p><p>Liuli's birth near Yuji Mountain sparked Qin Sang's hope that the local lineage might be related to the Chunqiu Gui.  If the *Su Wen Jing* is a later-era cultivation method, this would be confirmed.</p><p>The cultivation world constantly evolves.  Later cultivation methods differ significantly from ancient ones, developed and refined by generations of cultivators.  The *Su Wen Jing* exhibits characteristics of ancient texts: unclear境界 distinctions, less concise content, and crucial aspects of cultivation left unstated, relying heavily on the cultivator's own exploration and insight.</p><p>Cultivating the *Su Wen Jing* is a monumental undertaking. It presents all possible paths; the initial stages are manageable, but achieving great accomplishments requires trying all the texts to forge one's own way.</p><p>In later eras, the *Su Wen Jing* would likely be split into numerous texts, making it accessible even to cultivators with lesser talent. The original, however, demands significantly higher aptitude and insight.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, his hopes dashed.  The connection between the *Su Wen Jing* and the Chunqiu Gui remains uncertain, leaving him back at the starting point. Fortunately, he has other options.</p><p>…</p><p>Atop Yuji Mountain, a white cloud drifted in from the north.  Two exceptionally beautiful women stood upon it, each with unique charms.  These were Qing Hong and Shuang Luo, who had journeyed together after receiving a message from Qin Sang.</p><p>“Junior Sister, the place Master Brother mentioned in his message seems to be that mountain below!” Qing Hong gestured towards Yuji Mountain.</p><p>“I wonder how much Master Brother has changed.” Shuang Luo nodded softly.  Her cheeks flushed slightly.  Years apart, the image of him remained vivid in her memory, their unspoken feelings deepening like aged wine.</p><p>“He’s become even more arrogant,” Qing Hong said with a pout.</p><p>“He deserves to be arrogant,” Shuang Luo chuckled, covering her mouth.  Her disciples would be stunned; this was their fearsome, ice-cold Master?</p><p>They descended from the cloud. Before reaching the summit, a brilliant light erupted from the cliff face, revealing a portal.  Qin Sang greeted them.  "Senior Sisters, please enter. I apologize for not greeting you properly."</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p></p>
