<h1>Chapter 403: Igniting the Demonic Fire</h1><p>The Wuji Sect Master raised his sword, pointing it upwards.  The spiritual sword transformed into a streak of azure light, shooting skyward.  High in the air, it flashed, drawing in the surrounding gale, creating a vast void.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the spiritual sword vanished, leaving only a humming sound that echoed through the heavens, seemingly suppressing the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>Is this the most powerful technique of the *Shadowless Sword*?</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, his gaze shifting. He could only see emptiness in the void, unable to find the sword's true form, unsure where it had struck.</p><p>As the Wuji Sect Master made his move, another figure in a black robe also acted.</p><p>He formed a palm strike, condensing immense spiritual power, and slammed it towards the Xuan Turtle Shell.</p><p>The Xuan Turtle phantom trembled.  A thick, dark light surged from within the shell, instantly filling the entire phantom. At that moment, the Xuan Turtle seemed to come alive, like a real, ferocious beast.</p><p>A low roar, no less powerful than the sword's hum, echoed across the land as the Xuan Turtle raised its head.</p><p>Its giant eyes glowed crimson as it glared at the Thunder Hawk.  Its body was pitch-black, its shell like a piece of black iron.  Its massive body seemed heavy, yet it moved with surprising agility. In a flash, it crossed the void, appearing beside the Thunder Hawk, opening its bloody maw, its sharp fangs aiming for the Hawk's right wing.</p><p>‘Lì!’</p><p>The Thunder Hawk shrieked. The silver feathers on its long neck glittered, lightning coursing between them, finally converging towards its wings.</p><p>Its wings were dyed silver, transforming into a pair of enormous lightning wings.</p><p>Facing the Xuan Turtle's attack, the Thunder Hawk didn't flinch. Instead of dodging, it slammed its wings against the Turtle.</p><p>‘Pā!’</p><p>The giant wings struck, merging with the lightning storm, like two thunder whips, striking the Xuan Turtle squarely.</p><p>The Xuan Turtle howled, its movement halting as the lightning storm exploded within it.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk seized the opportunity, opening its beak and spewing a massive column of lightning.  The silver light on its body dimmed abruptly.</p><p>For some reason, the lightning column shot towards the empty space in front of it.</p><p>The humming sound stopped abruptly.  The lightning column transformed into a square lightning cage, trapping a spiritual sword within.</p><p>It was the Wuji Sect Master's sword!</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master, his sword move seen through, had to control his sword to break through the lightning cage.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk's ferocity soared; it was simultaneously blocking the attacks of two Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>At that moment, the Thunder Hawk, without pausing, its eyes flashing, suddenly fixed its gaze downward. Then, with a powerful beat of its wings, it transformed into a streak of lightning and fled.</p><p>‘Pēng!’</p><p>A figure, unseen until now, had been lurking there – the black-robed man.</p><p>He had stealthily approached, but the Thunder Hawk's lightning eyes had seen him, and the Hawk used its lightning escape to collide with him.</p><p>The black-robed man flew back, his form disheveled.  The Thunder Hawk relentlessly pursued, its lightning form bending to continue its chase.</p><p>The black-robed man, unprepared for the Hawk's ferocity, found himself in a perilous situation and retreated.</p><p>Seeing the danger, the Wuji Sect Master, ignoring his own sword, rushed to the black-robed man's aid.</p><p>Together, they barely managed to stop the Thunder Hawk, both being forced back.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk shrieked a warning at the two.</p><p>The black-robed man, nearly injured, was enraged. He said something to the Wuji Sect Master and abruptly sat cross-legged in the air.</p><p>The Xuan Turtle Shell hovered above, splitting in two, then four… as the black-robed man changed his hand seals.</p><p>Even Qin Sang could see that the black-robed man was preparing a powerful technique. The Thunder Hawk undoubtedly sensed the danger.</p><p>It immediately vibrated its wings, unleashing a furious lightning storm.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master leaped in front of the black-robed man, retrieving his sword and stroking it, forming a sword array to block the lightning storm, while the black-robed man remained seated, focused on his task.</p><p>The roles reversed; the Wuji Sect Master, employing various techniques, firmly held off the Thunder Hawk.</p><p>The battle took place in the distant sky. The gale and snow obscured the view, and Qin Sang could only see a fraction of the fight.</p><p>The black-robed man captured Qin Sang's attention.  Seeing the frequent changes in the Xuan Turtle Shell before him, Qin Sang knew he was preparing a complex and powerful technique that would take time to complete.</p><p>They seemed unwilling to give up!</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  The idea he had just dismissed rekindled.</p><p>Time was of the essence.  Seeing the opportunity arise, Qin Sang moved immediately.</p><p>He suppressed his aura with all his might, skirting the glacier downwards, carefully navigating the most turbulent areas of spiritual energy and sheltering behind a column of Xuan frost wind.</p><p>This would shield him from detection by the Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The deep cave lay at the foot of the mountain.  The closer Qin Sang got, the stronger the Xuan frost wind became.</p><p>His spirit was protected by the jade Buddha and remained unharmed, but his physical body began to feel the cold, a biting chill that quickly enveloped him, threatening to freeze him solid.</p><p>He had only just reached the cave's edge.</p><p>The Xuan frost wind's power was terrifying. Without the jade Buddha, he wouldn't have made it this far; his spirit would have been frozen to death by its chilling aura.</p><p>Even though the most extreme cold was ineffective against him, the wind’s chill overwhelmed the protection offered by the Red Pill.</p><p>Standing at the cave's edge, Qin Sang felt his meridians freeze.  He narrowed his eyes, peering into the blinding white expanse within.</p><p>The Thunder Hawk's nest might be deeper, or perhaps nothing was down there; he might have been wrong.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Red Pill in his right palm, his hand numb with cold.</p><p>Without the Red Pill, he would have had to retreat.  Going down, even if undetected by the two cultivators and the demon, he would quickly freeze to death.</p><p>This pill offered a slim chance.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a thread of spiritual energy into the Red Pill.  Igniting its demonic fire would offer temporary protection for his body until the flames died down.</p><p>However, due to the Red Pill's unique properties, once ignited, the demonic fire couldn't be stopped until it burned out, completely destroying the artifact.</p><p>Destroying such a precious item might yield nothing, a complete waste.</p><p>Time did not allow Qin Sang to deliberate.  The battle was ever-changing; he barely hesitated before deciding to activate the Red Pill's demonic fire.</p><p>The chaotic fire erupted, mirroring a scene he'd witnessed before. The Red Pill melted, its surface flowing with molten flames like a glaze.</p><p>Qin Sang tried his best to contain the fire’s aura, but the Xuan frost wind stood in the way, readily extinguishing any emanation.</p><p>With the Red Pill in hand, Qin Sang's hands were burning, but his body gradually warmed; the demonic fire was indeed working!</p><p>However, as the fire burned, the Red Pill melted away, shrinking steadily.</p><p>The Red Pill's effect was temporary.</p><p>Without delay, Qin Sang stepped into the cave, descending along the icy wall.</p><p>Simultaneously, he deployed the Ten Directions Yama Formation again, ghostly banners swirling around him. One hand held the Red Pill, the other his magic weapon.</p>
