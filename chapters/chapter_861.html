<h1>Chapter 853: Evasive Words</h1><p>The Bearded Elder's guess was correct. Qin Sang's true essence was indeed almost depleted. If the battle continued, it wouldn't be long before he would have to activate his Corpse Pill.</p><p>But the Corpse Pill hadn't been improved since its refinement. While it could power the escape talisman, it was inadequate for a fierce battle against powerful enemies, especially with a late-stage cultivator among them.</p><p>This Corpse Pill had become somewhat of a burden.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had an idea he had been pondering for a while, which might involve the Corpse Pill.</p><p>The evil art of refining an external avatar, "Cultivating the Demonic Fetus," contained a secret technique for birthing a Demonic Pill, which could create a core for the avatar.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be nearly impossible for an external avatar to comprehend and form a core on its own.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, this secret technique seemed to align with the External Elixir method, but it couldn't be separated from "Cultivating the Demonic Fetus," making it unusable by ordinary cultivators.</p><p>But it wasn't entirely unmodifiable.</p><p>The Corpse Pill was Qin Sang's externally connected elixir, and "Cultivating the Demonic Fetus" refined his external avatar. Both were inherently linked.  Therefore, Qin Sang wanted to use the secret technique to reshape the Corpse Pill for his avatar's use.</p><p>This way, since the Corpse Pill was already a formed external elixir, not only would the success rate of the secret technique be much higher, but he would also save himself the trouble of preparing various spiritual materials, only needing to wait for his avatar to reach the Pseudo Core Realm.</p><p>Of course, the avatar hadn't reached the Core Formation stage yet, so Qin Sang was just speculating, with less than a thirty percent chance of success. He wasn't sure whether "Cultivating the Demonic Fetus" could reshape the Corpse Pill and break the limitations of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Art."  Only by trying would he know.</p><p>If he succeeded, his understanding of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Art" would deepen, and perhaps he could find a way to save Yagu.</p><p>Three-Light Jade Liquid nourished her body, Warm Jade and the Fat Silkworm stabilized her soul.  Under these conditions, she could remain dormant for decades without dying.</p><p>But despite trying everything, Qin Sang had no clue how to save Yagu. She could only continue to sleep, her awakening uncertain, her fate unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. He, along with the Two-Headed Serpent, flew straight towards the agreed meeting place.</p><p>Immortal Yue and the other two were all late-stage cultivators. After completing their rearguard mission, they should be able to escape easily, and perhaps someone was already waiting at the meeting point.</p><p>If these people were still relentlessly pursuing, they shouldn't blame him for being ruthless.</p><p>A fierce glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes as he flew away without looking back.</p><p>Before long, his true essence was indeed nearing depletion. He deliberately slowed down, then activated the Corpse Pill to maintain the talisman.</p><p>The Bearded Elder, who was in close pursuit, saw this and his eyes lit up, further convinced that Qin Sang was on his last legs.</p><p>The chase continued for an unknown distance.</p><p>As the agreed meeting place drew near, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something. His expression shifted slightly, and he deliberately slowed down further.  The Serpent Soul surrounding him flickered incessantly, looking as if it could barely hold on and was about to dissipate.</p><p>The Bearded Elder, unsuspecting, was overjoyed and sped up his pursuit.</p><p>When he got close, Qin Sang suddenly turned and attacked with his sword.</p><p>The Bearded Elder was prepared. He countered with his square seal, while vigilantly scanning the surroundings, believing that Qin Sang, cornered, would surely summon his spirit beast.</p><p>That woman must be hiding nearby.</p><p>As long as he took Qin Sang's life, capturing her would be easy.</p><p>Sword Qi and silver characters collided, creating a storm and stirring up large waves on the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A water column suddenly erupted from the seabed.</p><p>The Bearded Elder snorted, unafraid. Already prepared, he flicked his sleeve, and a jade Ruyi shot out, meeting the water column.</p><p>The next moment, his expression changed dramatically.</p><p>Hidden beneath the water column was not the spirit beast, but an old man.</p><p>This person was Elder Zhushan.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned from the Two-Headed Serpent that not only Elder Zhushan but also Immortal Yue was present. Only Kong Yun hadn't arrived yet. They had set a trap, waiting for the enemy to fall into it.</p><p>After Elder Zhushan appeared, Immortal Yue also emerged from the water, surrounding the Bearded Elder on three sides.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Bearded Elder was shocked.  Who would have thought that so many experts would gather in the remote Demonic Sea?</p><p>His cave dwelling was nearby, yet he hadn't noticed a thing.</p><p>Immortal Yue's cultivation alone could suppress the Bearded Elder, and with Qin Sang and Elder Zhushan assisting, the Bearded Elder, despite his strength, was doomed.</p><p>After a bitter struggle, the Bearded Elder fought desperately but still couldn't escape his fate, perishing under Elder Zhushan's sword.</p><p>After killing the Bearded Elder, the Two-Headed Serpent returned, rushing towards Qin Sang.  With little true essence remaining, Qin Sang entrusted his safety to the Two-Headed Serpent, holding spirit stones to recover.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is truly unfathomable!  Just now, when the spirit beast sent a message, I thought Su Nu had been captured by a demonic beast and almost attacked it. Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Zhushan reminded me.  Asking Fellow Daoist to protect Su Nu was truly a wise decision..."</p><p>Immortal Yue spoke flattering words towards the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>Elder Zhushan echoed her sentiments.</p><p>Their attitudes towards Qin Sang had clearly changed.  Previously, they were merely surprised by his escape technique and swordsmanship. Now, discovering that he also possessed such a powerful spirit beast, they realized he was their equal, perhaps even stronger.</p><p>After a brief recovery, Qin Sang said, "This person had two companions. Don't let them escape."</p><p>The Liu surnamed cultivator had fallen behind earlier. Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, he turned and fled.  The wealthy gentleman was still refining the sword Qi behind them.</p><p>The three immediately set off.</p><p>The hunters became the hunted in an instant.</p><p>The other two were also eliminated one after another, and the three divided the spoils, making a handsome profit.</p><p>Although they didn't find the specific items Qin Sang urgently needed, they unexpectedly found some spirit flowers that the Skyeye Butterfly favored, which could be considered a reward for the butterfly's contribution.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, there are such treacherous cultivators here, putting Fellow Daoist in danger.  Fortunately, Fellow Daoist is highly skilled and protected Su Nu..."</p><p>Immortal Yue expressed her gratitude.</p><p>"I brought Su Nu out of the Demonic Island and happened to encounter them. The phenomenon caused by the Demonic Qi is visible for hundreds of miles and probably attracted them. Thanks to the timely assistance of the two Fellow Daoists, I almost couldn't hold on."</p><p>He vaguely felt something strange about the relationship between Su Nu and Immortal Yue.</p><p>However, he only wanted to obtain the treasure smoothly and didn't want to cause trouble, so he chose to be vague.  Immortal Yue didn't ask, and he wouldn't actively mention the reason for the conflict, much less reveal Su Nu's strange behavior.</p><p>Su Nu lowered her head, her eyes filled with despair.  She was stunned by his words.</p><p>She had actually remembered some things, but Immortal Yue's cultivation was beyond her reach.  She could only suppress her fear and hatred, treating Immortal Yue as a close relative.</p><p>The earlier ambush had given her a glimmer of hope. She knew that escaping in the chaos was a slim chance, a life-or-death gamble, but she still took it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang had such a powerful spirit beast, giving her no opportunity.</p><p>She didn't think her actions could be hidden from these cunning old foxes, but to her surprise, Qin Sang didn't mention it at all.</p>
