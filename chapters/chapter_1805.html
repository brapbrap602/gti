<h1>Chapter 1796: The Path of Ascension</h1><p>“The marker gate of Guixu ultimately leads to this realm? Why are there no traces left by ascended predecessors here?”</p><p>Confirming the other party's identity, Qin Sang directly posed the biggest question in his heart.</p><p>Mo Xingdao seemed to be observing Qin Sang's expression, hesitated for a moment, and then asked in return, “Did Fellow Daoist Qin not ascend through Guixu?”</p><p>In the Storm Realm, without Nascent Soul stage strength, it's difficult to even reach Guixu, let alone traverse the Path of Ascension.</p><p>Having heard Wan Zhenren's assessment, Mo Xingdao knew that Qin Sang cultivated both body and Qi, and based on his performance in the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, he could also guess that Qi cultivation was his foundation.</p><p>Breakthroughs achieved solely through body refinement, without reaching the corresponding realm, wouldn't allow one to sense the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound.</p><p>A Nascent Soul stage body indeed possessed the strength to venture into Guixu, but logically, unless Qin Sang knew his days were numbered, he would definitely wait for his realm to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, ensuring absolute certainty, before entering Guixu.</p><p>Could he have advanced to Nascent Soul in the Storm Realm?</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Mo Xingdao's thoughts and said frankly, "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to probe. I am already aware of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound. However, I did not enter Guixu. Are you aware that there is not only the Guixu path to ascension in the Storm Realm, but also the Ascension Platform?"</p><p>"Ascension Platform?"</p><p>For the first time, ripples of emotion appeared in Mo Xingdao's voice.</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded, "I actually originated from the North Sea and travelled across the ocean to the Central Continent. During my cultivation in the North Sea, I personally witnessed someone activate the Ascension Platform and ascend to the upper realm..."</p><p>Qin Sang concealed nothing, recounting the beginning of the chaos in the Xiao Han Region and the process of his senior sister and others ascending.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent as he listened to Qin Sang's narration.</p><p>After finishing, Qin Sang shook his head slightly and sighed, "Once my cultivation reached a certain level and I revealed this matter, desiring to unite the sects to search for the Ascension Platform, Grandmaster Xing Ji then revealed the whole truth. If the three fellow daoists had waited a few more years, or informed the world about the tribulation of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, how could things have come to this!"</p><p>He already knew that Sage Huiguang and Saintess Qinghu had given Mo Xingdao two choices.</p><p>Either possess a puppet, with the risk of being backlashed by the puppet.</p><p>Or forcibly undergo the tribulation. If he failed, his True Essence would be forced into the puppet, controlled by the two Nascent Soul cultivators, but only for a limited time.</p><p>Mo Xingdao must have chosen the former.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the stiff face on the stone, unable to discern any change in expression, and wondered what Mo Xingdao was thinking at this moment.</p><p>After a long silence, Mo Xingdao sighed softly, "So, Fellow Daoist found the Ascension Platform, successfully activated it, and ascended to this realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"When was the day of activation?" Mo Xingdao's tone suddenly quickened, asking repeatedly.</p><p>Hearing the time Qin Sang stated, Mo Xingdao gave a wry smile, "Indeed! We must have arrived in this realm on the same day."</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, immediately realizing something, and asked in a deep voice, "Did you hunt ferocious beasts in the Storm Belt and Guixu?"</p><p>"We didn't kill any, but we encountered them many times. In the Storm Belt, we were chased by two monstrous fish. After entering Guixu, ferocious beasts roamed everywhere, countless in number. Utilizing the Five Elements Crown's Great Five Elements Absolute Extinction Divine Light to restrain the beasts, we were able to escape danger repeatedly..."</p><p>Years later, Mo Xingdao's memories of those experiences remained vivid, demonstrating how perilous their journey within Guixu had been.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange look flashed across Qin Sang's eyes, "You weren't pursued by the Blood Moon?"</p><p>"What Blood Moon?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao was puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the other two had set off earlier than him, and had also clashed with beasts in the Storm Belt. After entering Guixu, they had fought even more fiercely, yet they hadn't been pursued by the Blood Moon.</p><p>Yet the Blood Moon had specifically targeted him, waiting outside the Canglang Sea barrier, and even daring to enter the spatial storm to pursue him. What was the reason?</p><p>What deep hatred existed between them?</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had suspected that the Blood Moon might be a great demon, desiring to devour a realm, using the demonic sound to sever the path to Nascent Soul for cultivators in this realm, and hunting down anyone attempting to escape this cage. He had exposed his aura and whereabouts while fighting the Thunder Turtle, thus attracting the pursuit.</p><p>Knowing Mo Xingdao's experience, he realized it wasn't so simple.</p><p>Or perhaps the Blood Moon was the king of the Guixu beasts, and the Thunder Turtle was killed by him, thus enraging this demon?</p><p>Unable to find an answer, Qin Sang temporarily put aside these questions and asked a crucial one, "Did you not traverse the marker gate to ascend to this realm?"</p><p>From Mo Xingdao's previous answer and tone, Qin Sang already had a guess.</p><p>Mo Xingdao didn't conceal anything, directly recounting their experiences within Guixu.</p><p>It turned out that back then, Mo Xingdao, coerced by the two Nascent Soul cultivators, travelled east, crossing the Storm Belt and entering Guixu without major incident.</p><p>They then discovered that the interior of Guixu was extremely dangerous, even more so than recorded in ancient texts. They followed the records left by their predecessors, searching for Mount Daiyu, and repeatedly encountered danger.</p><p>Fortunately, those ferocious beasts were also affected by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, falling into madness and killing each other, thus preventing them from being besieged.</p><p>Finally, after overcoming numerous hardships and dangers, they delved deep into Guixu, successfully finding Mount Daiyu, and saw the images and writings left by many predecessors and sages, recording their experiences and insights.</p><p>From Mount Daiyu to the marker gate, there was still a distance, more dangerous than the upper layers of Guixu, known as the Path of Ascension.</p><p>The Path of Ascension was not static; due to the instability within Guixu, it would change every few years.</p><p>It was thanks to generations of ascenders bravely venturing forth and recording their experiences on Mount Daiyu for future generations to reference that the legacy of ascension continued unbroken.</p><p>"We obtained the writings left by our predecessors on Mount Daiyu, made some adjustments, and entered the Path of Ascension. But the ferocious beasts, influenced by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, caused widespread destruction during their frenzied battles, disrupting this place. The Path of Ascension deviated greatly from the records, and many places had to be explored on our own. With Mount Daiyu as a resting place, we made some progress. But as we neared the marker gate, the interior of Guixu suddenly became turbulent. We were caught off guard and flung out by a tremendous force..."</p><p>Mo Xingdao's emotions were complex, the eyes on the stone staring intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>The time when Qin Sang activated the Ascension Platform was the very day Guixu became turbulent.</p><p>Such a coincidence, and being sent to the same world, it must be related to Qin Sang.</p><p>Mo Xingdao didn't know whether to thank or curse Qin Sang.</p><p>Without this incident, they would have reached the marker gate and ascended normally, without experiencing a near-death experience and landing in this strange Daoist world.</p><p>However, their situation at the time was also extremely precarious.</p><p>Exploring the Path of Ascension required the Five Elements Crown, constantly activating the Great Five Elements Absolute Extinction Divine Light. They had to simultaneously contend with the chaotic Guixu, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, and the demonic spirits' invasion, facing immense pressure.</p><p>Mount Daiyu was only relatively safe, serving as a temporary place for rest and recuperation. They could only recover partially, their strength continuously declining.</p><p>Perhaps, without this incident, they would have perished in Guixu, never reaching the marker gate.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, what anomaly did you encounter when activating the Ascension Platform? And what is this Blood Moon?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao asked in a deep voice.</p><p>"During the ascension, a Blood Moon appeared in the sky, transforming into a crimson rainbow and descending, pursuing me into the spatial storm, causing a deviation in my ascension. What did you encounter after entering the spatial rift, and how did you arrive in this realm? Where are Sage Huiguang and Saintess Qinghu now?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a deep voice.</p><p>"The Blood Moon pursued you?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao was startled, murmuring, "When activating the Five Elements Crown, one person controlled it at a time, while the others assisted. The person controlling the crown was most affected, so we took turns. At that time, Sage Huiguang was controlling the crown, reaching his limit, and was about to hand it over to Saintess Qinghu when Guixu suddenly became turbulent. We and the Five Elements Crown were all scattered, flung into the spatial rift. I could only do my best to protect myself against the turbulent spatial currents, and then I fell into a terrifying suction force, quickly losing consciousness due to my severe injuries. Before I fainted, I only saw Sage Huiguang swept away by the spatial currents, disappearing instantly."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang sighed. He had thought there might be a chance to settle the score with Sage Huiguang.</p><p>Being swept away by spatial currents while weakened, even a Nascent Soul cultivator's chances of survival were slim.</p><p>Even if Sage Huiguang had miraculously survived, who knew which realm he would be swept to, the chance of meeting again was slim.</p><p>Seeing that Mo Xingdao only mentioned Sage Huiguang, not Saintess Qinghu, Qin Sang asked about her, his grudge against her being even deeper.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said he didn't know, "Saintess Qinghu should have been not far from me at the time, and her strength was still considerable. If she was sucked into this realm, her chances of survival are high. Not long ago, someone reported to the Dao Court that a Heavenly Tribulation of Ascension appeared in Jushan Zhi. I initially thought it was her."</p><p>After inquiring about the time and location, Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. He had chosen such a remote location for his tribulation, yet it was still witnessed.</p><p>Qin Sang admitted that the person undergoing the tribulation was indeed him, glancing sideways towards the pavilion, "So, the one who saved Fellow Daoist was True Person Hongyuzi?"</p><p>"Precisely."</p><p>Mo Xingdao then relayed Hongyuzi's speculations to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished, glancing around, "You suspect that the Jushan Zhi altar is connected to Guixu?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao hummed in agreement, "Back then, I thought I was flung into a spatial rift. Now, it seems that is debatable. Just now, I followed Hongyuzi into the depths of the altar and discovered that the scenery of the Path of Ascension bears many similarities to this place. Perhaps..."</p><p>Pausing, Mo Xingdao's tone revealed a hint of awe, "We didn't fall into a spatial rift at all, but into a divine ability left by an ancient mighty figure, connecting the two realms! Even if not, there must be a strong connection between the two realms, not far apart. As long as we determine the location of the scene in my last memory, we might be able to return to the Path of Ascension and get back on track!"</p><p>"Find the marker gate again..."</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>He had painstakingly sought ascension qualification, and just as he was about to succeed, he received a clue to the Path of Ascension.</p><p>"Aren't you afraid of the Blood Moon waiting behind the marker gate?" Qin Sang's tone was strange.</p><p>It had been confirmed that behind the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound was a living being. Qin Sang even had a speculation that the Storm Belt was the demon's hunting ground, and all previous ascenders had been devoured by that demon.</p><p>This speculation was too terrifying, Qin Sang dared not dwell on it.</p><p>"Didn't you say the demon chased you into the spatial rift and was swept away by the spatial storm? Even if that demon returns..."</p><p>Mo Xingdao paused, his tone filled with intense killing intent, "By connecting the two realms, we can enlist the help of the powerful Daoists of this realm to slay the demon and eliminate the evil! I have followed Hongyuzi for many years and heard him confirm that in the Dao Court's two academies' altars, a Grand Master is merely in charge of the altar, while a True Monarch can be a Zhi Du Gong, wielding the Du Gong Seal and commanding all the True Ones!"</p><p>True Monarch, a Body Integration stage expert!</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang heard someone confirm that there were indeed True Monarchs in this realm, and that both academies of the Dao Court had True Monarchs presiding over them.</p><p>If even a True Monarch wasn't a match for that demon, it would be too despairing, leaving no hope for the countless beings in the Storm Realm.</p><p>According to Mo Xingdao, this realm was not a Great Thousand World; the true Great Thousand World lay beyond the marker gate.</p><p>In this realm, Qin Sang always felt a sense of oppression. If he could leave this realm and completely resolve the troubles of the Storm Realm, he would naturally be more than willing.</p><p>Having unexpectedly fallen into this realm, he thought there would be little chance of seeing Liu Li again, but heaven never seals off all exits.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still had one question, "Why did Fellow Daoist Mo deliberately avoid others and reveal these secrets to me?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao had been saved by Hongyuzi, followed him for many years, and was now protecting him, indicating that Hongyuzi trusted him considerably.</p><p>Relying on the Dao Court's power, the hope of finding the Path of Ascension was greater, so why secretly seek him, a lone cultivator?</p><p>Mo Xingdao was silent for a moment, then said, "Fellow Daoist Qin and I come from the same place. I believe we can be of one mind and one heart, and you will fully assist me. Moreover, Fellow Daoist Qin likely doesn't want to reveal your true origins. As for the Dao Court, for some reason, I always feel that Hongyuzi isn't very interested in the Path of Ascension; his goal is still the Guifang Kingdom. The secrets I know are all those Hongyuzi wanted me to know. This realm isn't so simple. How vast the Nie Yuan and Nie Hai are, and where they end, no one knows. Perhaps, this realm is no less than the world beyond the marker gate."</p><p>In addition, there was another crucial reason.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said coldly, "I don't want to be controlled by others for the rest of my life!"</p><p>Hearing these words, and recalling Mo Xingdao's performance in the pavilion, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>Clearly, being saved by Hongyuzi back then came at a price.</p><p>A Nascent Soul stage puppet was not something even a Nine Heavens Golden Palace Censor could ignore.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. After pondering for a long time, he cautiously said, "Fellow Daoist Mo, do you want me to join you, secretly searching for the Path of Ascension, and using the marker gate to escape this constraint?"</p><p>The premise was that the demon had already left the Storm Realm.</p><p>If the demon was still there, they could divert the trouble, and Mo Xingdao could also take the opportunity to escape during the battle between the Dao Court and the demon.</p><p>"Hongyuzi is meticulous. If not for this, I would have no hope," Mo Xingdao affirmed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. The difference in strength between Mo Xingdao and Hongyuzi was too great; he could only rely on external forces.</p><p>Should he join forces with Mo Xingdao?</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons and concluded that the benefits outweighed the risks.</p><p>There was a big problem with this realm. One day, when his strength increased and he came into contact with the truth of this realm, some troubles would be unavoidable. The Path of Ascension was a way out.</p><p>After ascending, he could continue cultivating and gradually explore.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang nodded slightly, "It won't be convenient for Fellow Daoist Mo to meet with me in the future. How should I be instructed?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao had already formulated a plan, saying, "I've been preparing for these years. I'll give you a method of contact. We can contact each other secretly in the future, but not too frequently."</p>
