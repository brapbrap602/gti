<h1>Chapter 940: Soul-Refining Banner</h1><p>Chapter 940: Soul-Refining Banner</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The Soul-Nourishing Wood was pitch-black, riddled with holes, resembling a piece of worm-eaten deadwood.  Qin Sang had seen similar descriptions in ancient texts.</p><p>On its surface, a faint bluish light shimmered.  Just seeing it seemed to soothe the soul, the unique soul light of the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>“So large!”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and overjoyed. The  Blood Mulberry from the Thunder Hawk demon’s lair, a thin sliver, had already elevated his magic weapon to a treasure; if he could refine this piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood, to what level could the Ebony Sword rise?</p><p>Could it directly advance to a spiritual treasure?</p><p>Such a large piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood would certainly be able to withstand the corrosion of the Blood Mulberry.</p><p>On second thought, it made sense. If the Soul-Nourishing Wood were too small, its soul light insufficient, Bai's residual soul likely wouldn't have persisted this long.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai, wondering if this person would honestly hand over all of it.</p><p>However, even if Bai had hidden some of the wood, he didn't want to pursue the matter.</p><p>It’s best to know when to stop. Greed is insatiable.</p><p>This amount of Soul-Nourishing Wood was enough to elevate his Ebony Sword to an unimaginable level, allowing him to dominate the current cultivation world. More importantly, his cultivation would no longer be restricted—a huge boon.</p><p>There was no need to press further.</p><p>If Bai were pushed too hard, he might destroy the Soul-Nourishing Wood in desperation, leading to mutual destruction; that wouldn't be good.</p><p>Bai had been secretly observing Qin Sang’s expression.  Upon meeting Qin Sang's gaze, he felt a tightening in his chest, but saw that Qin Sang's expression remained calm, without further pressure.</p><p>After a deep look at Qin Sang, Bai raised the Soul-Nourishing Wood, saying, “Friend Daoist, you see, the soul light of this treasure is undeniable. Of course, I cannot give you all of this Soul-Nourishing Wood; I need to keep some for my own cultivation.”</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Bai pointed to the middle of the Soul-Nourishing Wood, indicating he wanted to split it evenly with Qin Sang.</p><p>After some bargaining, Bai stated that his bottom line was to keep at least a quarter.</p><p>After some consideration, Qin Sang slowly nodded, "As Daoist friend wishes! But I hear that Soul-Nourishing Wood is unique compared to other spirit woods, it cannot be forcefully cut.  We must be cautious, otherwise, the wood's power will be diminished…"</p><p>Bai confidently replied, "Friend Daoist, rest assured, I have been with this piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood day and night and know it very well. Moreover, its fragility is only relative to the ten sacred trees. As long as we are careful enough, the wood will not be damaged. Since Daoist friend agrees, I'll divide it now…"</p><p>With that, Bai placed his other hand above the Soul-Nourishing Wood.  Corpse energy surged between his palms, transforming into countless complex runes, which twisted and changed into a blade of corpse energy, thin as a cicada's wing.</p><p>The corpse energy blade trembled slightly, falling onto the spot Bai had indicated, slowly cutting downwards.</p><p>The corpse energy blade seemed to flow, silently gliding along the wood's grain, slowly separating the wood.</p><p>Bai's movements were extremely cautious, and Qin Sang, watching from the side, felt a surge of tension.</p><p>After a long while, the Soul-Nourishing Wood was successfully divided into two pieces.</p><p>The moment it was done, both of them breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>“After we leave this ghost land, this piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood will be yours, Friend Daoist. If you are not at ease, you can place a restriction on it,” Bai smiled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate, setting several restrictions on the Soul-Nourishing Wood, sealing it.</p><p>Bai didn't mind, putting away his piece of the Soul-Nourishing Wood and said urgently, “We wasted quite some time negotiating. Since the time in this secret realm is limited, let's get to work! I don't want to stay here a moment longer!”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it was wasted time. Only in this way can we trust and cooperate effectively.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, producing the banner pole of the demon banner and said to Bai, "Daoist friend, go and summon the lost souls. I will start refining the spirit threads. Once the demon banner is refined, we can collect the demonic fire."</p><p>“Very well, I'll go awaken the souls; I will rely on you afterward.”</p><p>Bai vanished into the ghost mist.</p><p>Shortly after, a mournful wailing sound came from deep within the ghost mist. Then the mist churned, countless phantoms appearing within, a terrifying scene.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the bone mountain, holding the banner pole, gently shaking it.</p><p>After Bai lured the lost souls, the two exchanged glances. Bai waved his hand, using the ghost mist to restrain the souls, allowing Qin Sang to focus on absorbing the soul energy.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his secret technique, his fingers flicking, sending out runes towards the front row of souls.</p><p>The souls stirred.</p><p>Bai's face darkened, and he hissed a command.  The ghost mist pressed down heavily upon the restless spirits, pinning them in place.  They stood obediently, awaiting Qin Sang's spell.</p><p>The moment the secret technique concluded, a pure thread of spirit energy rose from each spirit, coalescing towards Qin Sang.</p><p>After extracting this essence, the spirits appeared somewhat weakened, but far better off than they would have been if they'd been refined completely.</p><p>Qin Sang gathered the spirit energy, focusing all his effort on forging the spirit threads.</p><p>The two-headed  [creature name - needs clarification in original text] stood guard on either side.</p><p>Bai glanced at Qin Sang before retreating back into the ghost mist to summon more spirits.</p><p>This method, though far more complex than before, freed Qin Sang from needing to suppress the spirits himself, making the overall process surprisingly fast.  Soon, Qin Sang held a long, shimmering spirit thread.</p><p>He signaled for Bai to stop, then picked up a banner pole, beginning work on the demonic banner.</p><p>Being his first attempt, Qin Sang was a little clumsy, but after a few failed attempts, he found his rhythm. The spirit thread coiled around the pole, merging seamlessly. The outline of a demonic banner slowly took shape.</p><p>The most difficult part of crafting the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner was refining the Xuan iron pole; making the banner itself was considerably easier.  Qin Sang's superior skill made this stage far simpler than the pole's creation.  He successfully completed the first banner.</p><p>Qin Sang gave it a forceful wave. The banner stirred, but nothing extraordinary happened.</p><p>Its true power would only be unleashed once infused with Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Bai, observing from the periphery, watched Qin Sang curiously. Seeing Qin Sang retrieve another pole, he immediately returned to summon more spirits.</p><p>Bai ran back and forth countless times, until nine more black banners lay at Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>"Friend, just how many banners do you intend to create?" Bai asked, breathless.</p><p>Controlling the ghost mist and binding the spirits was taxing; he was exhausted, though being in this spirit land helped him endure.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced up, a slight smile playing on his lips. "Seven more to go.  Should be enough to help you break the magical seal, wouldn't you say?"</p><p>"More than enough!" Bai gritted his teeth, then exclaimed in surprise, "Fifteen banners, plus the three you already had...eighteen in total!  There's a clear connection between them, capable of forming a powerful array. The more banners, the stronger the array.  With eighteen banners, even a Yuan Ying cultivator would be wary of confronting you!"</p>
