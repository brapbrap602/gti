<h1>Chapter 1193: Near Trace Mountain</h1><p>Qin Sang was quite familiar with Che Yutao.</p><p>When Qin Sang was at Shaohua Mountain, Che Yutao was already a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Many years ago, Che Yutao had reached the peak of the Golden Core stage and was said to be the most likely among the current generation of Shaohua Mountain cultivators to advance to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qiu Mubai, on the other hand, was the most valued disciple of Dongyang Bo and had also broken through to the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was only at the mid-Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, everyone else, including Mu Yifeng, was exceptionally talented.</p><p>It was clear that Dongyang Bo was protecting these gifted disciples, hoping that one of them would advance to the Nascent Soul stage and continue the sect's legacy, rather than having them perish on the battlefield.</p><p>This aligned with Qingzhu's assessment of him.</p><p>Having confirmed that Mu Yifeng was safe, Qin Sang felt at ease and saw no need to rush to meet him.</p><p>As a disciple of Shaohua Mountain, Mu Yifeng likely wouldn't lack for elixirs. At most, Qin Sang could gift him a few protective treasures and share his own insights on advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, giving Mu Yifeng an additional reference.</p><p>As for cultivation techniques and secret arts, most of what Qin Sang practiced were unorthodox methods, heavily reliant on the Jade Buddha, which others simply couldn't cultivate.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the tall building.</p><p>After several days of quiet cultivation, the seventh sword soul finally showed signs of merging with Qin Sang's primordial spirit!</p><p>No one disturbed him.</p><p>Three more days passed.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes snapped open, shining like lightning, with sword shadows flickering within his pupils.</p><p>Then, he pointed a finger into the empty space before him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword shot out, coming to an abrupt halt in the center of the meditation chamber.</p><p>A blinding golden light filled the chamber, only to dim suddenly as the Seven Souls Slaughter Array silently took form.</p><p>In an instant, the chamber became shrouded in an eerie darkness.</p><p>Previously, when Qin Sang activated the sword array, each sword light was bright and clearly visible.</p><p>Now, within the Seven Souls Slaughter Array, all the sword shadows appeared ethereal, flickering in and out of sight, making it difficult to even discern the outline of the array. Yet, the entire array exuded an aura of darkness, depth, and mystery.</p><p>"In future battles, it won't be so easy for opponents to find weaknesses," Qin Sang thought to himself with a nod.</p><p>However, the surprises didn't end there.</p><p>As Qin Sang altered the sword technique, the array underwent endless transformations, becoming even more mysterious. With each sword light that slashed out, an unprecedented and peculiar aura emerged.</p><p>After a brief moment of sensing, Qin Sang's eyes sparkled with excitement. "No wonder it's called the Seven Souls Slaughter Array! It can actually harm the opponent's primordial spirit. Once I master this array, I might even be able to use its power to trap an opponent's Nascent Soul. Although the Nine Nether Demonic Flame can also disorient an opponent's consciousness, the flame isn't truly mine. I haven't fully subdued or controlled it, and relying on the demonic banner to wield it inevitably falls short. It works well against low-level cultivators but is less effective against Nascent Soul cultivators with strong wills."</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators are notoriously difficult to kill.</p><p>Even in defeat, they can at least escape by releasing their Nascent Soul.</p><p>Unless the difference in strength is overwhelming, leaving no chance for the Nascent Soul to escape.</p><p>Thus, among Nascent Soul cultivators, unless one is confident in trapping the opponent's Nascent Soul, they often resort to duels or exchanges to resolve conflicts, avoiding the creation of a deadly enemy.</p><p>"Hmm! Although the Seven Souls Slaughter Array is impressive, to fully unleash its power, I must continue to advance in the sword path. Additionally, it also depends on my cultivation level and the grade of my spirit sword."</p><p>Qin Sang focused on sensing the array, comprehending its myriad transformations in hopes of mastering it quickly.</p><p>After a while, he put away the array and summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword had been nourishing within his primordial spirit, devouring Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The process was still incomplete, and the spirit sword remained in its embryonic form.</p><p>Just as he was about to check how much longer it would take, he felt the chamber's restrictions being disturbed. With a sweep of his divine sense, he discovered that Fat Chicken and Tan Yien had returned.</p><p>"I thought you two had been captured by the Sin Abyss!"</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the door open and looked at the man and the demon, letting out a cold snort.</p><p>These two had gone out to find someone, but they had been gone for so long, only returning now.</p><p>Fat Chicken, with a cheeky grin, ran over to claim credit. "Master, you are wise! When the Sin Abyss first attacked, we were almost caught up in it. Fortunately, I was quick-witted and, seeing the situation turn bad, immediately hid with Tan Yien. Otherwise, we might not have made it back to see you! On the way, I heard of your fame, Master, for slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator in battle. Your martial prowess is unparalleled, and you will surely unite the Small Cold Domain! No! Unite the North Star Realm! And wipe out the demon race in one fell swoop!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Fat Chicken's rambling and turned to Tan Yien.</p><p>Tan Yien was much more composed.</p><p>"Reporting to Uncle-Master, it didn't take me long to find two of my father's old acquaintances. However, the information I gathered from them pointed to another person. After discussing with Senior, we decided not to disturb you and instead waited until we found that person and obtained concrete information before reporting back to you."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite pleased. The younger generation was clever and efficient.</p><p>"That person is also a Golden Core senior, surnamed Tong. Senior Tong is not from either of the two domains but hails from a desert oasis. After being attacked by the Sin Abyss, he was forced to flee with his relatives and friends to the Tianxing Alliance. After some twists and turns, we finally met Senior Tong in person. From him, we learned some information related to my father. However, we couldn't verify its accuracy, and Senior Tong also wished to report to you in person. He is currently waiting outside the array..."</p><p>Tan Yien explained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, already understanding the man's intentions. "This matter isn't a secret. Bring him in. Tell him that as long as the information is valuable, I won't be stingy with rewards."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Tan Yien withdrew and soon returned, leading in a middle-aged cultivator wearing a high crown and ceremonial robes.</p><p>"Junior Tong Jinshan pays his respects to the Demon King!"</p><p>Tong Jinshan couldn't help but feel a bit of fear in the presence of such a renowned demon, but as a Golden Core cultivator himself, he didn't appear too overwhelmed.</p><p>"What is your relationship with Tan Hao? Do you know his whereabouts?"</p><p>Qin Sang got straight to the point.</p><p>"My home was destroyed by the Sin Abyss, and I bear a deep hatred for them. On the battlefield, I fought alongside Fellow Daoist Tan, sharing hardships. Fellow Daoist Tan was righteous and generous, and I received his help on several occasions."</p><p>Tong Jinshan hesitated, glancing at Tan Yien. "If it were anyone else asking about Fellow Daoist Tan, I wouldn't easily disclose anything. But since it's Nephew Yien searching for his father, I assume there's no ill intent. Moreover, Fellow Daoist Tan ventured deep into the Sin Abyss and never returned, disappearing for a hundred years. I, too, am very concerned..."</p><p>"So he did go to the Sin Abyss!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Tong Jinshan continued without holding back, "We once joined forces to kill a Golden Core cultivator from the Sin Abyss. This person was a corpse-path demonic cultivator, but his corpse puppet was quite peculiar. The strongest Flying Sky Yaksha within it wasn't filled with yin energy but with earth-fiend energy. For some reason, Fellow Daoist Tan seemed to regard this person as a mortal enemy, willing to offer all his possessions to enlist our help in capturing him. Unfortunately, this person was quite powerful, aided by the Flying Sky Yaksha, and the battlefield was too chaotic. He nearly escaped, and we had no choice but to kill him. Later, from other captives, we learned that this person was a rogue cultivator who had previously been active near the Sin Abyss's major sect, Near Trace Mountain..."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thanks to Wang Duoyu, the big boss from Qidian, for the alliance leader reward.</p><p>Three chapters owed now, the pressure is immense !</p>
