<h1>Chapter 864: Uninvited Guests</h1><p>“Keep going, don’t let it breathe!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang roared, thrusting his blood-red sword deeper.</p><p>The Kui dragon still had the strength to resist; countless bolts of lightning surged into the wound, preventing the sword from penetrating further.</p><p>Fang recalled his sword and, with the cooperation of Qin Sang and the others, continued the attack.</p><p>The Kui dragon was struggling to defend itself; its wounds multiplied. These were not superficial injuries like before; each one was deep, exposing bone, leaving bloody gashes that prevented clotting and healing.</p><p>The battle continued, but the outcome was decided.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>During the fight, their true energy was constantly being absorbed by the crystal stele; their corpse pills were exhausted. Qin Sang was forced to activate his Golden Core.</p><p>The others had no external pills, so their consumption was even greater. They had been worried, but seeing victory and the treasure within reach, smiles spread across their faces.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang outwardly appeared extremely excited, his eyes gleaming with greed, but inwardly he was tense, his body taut.</p><p>No one noticed that while attacking the Kui dragon, he kept glancing towards the sea beyond the island, the direction from which the dragon appeared, as if waiting for something.</p><p>The others remained oblivious, pressing their attack on the Kui dragon.</p><p>The cage tightened.</p><p>Ma Debao urged Fang to go all out, fully activating the blood sword to quickly kill the Kui dragon.</p><p>The Kui dragon's resistance weakened; victory seemed imminent.  At that moment, several points of light suddenly flashed in the distant storm clouds, clearly visible against the night sky, rapidly approaching the battlefield.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A loud shout echoed from afar, faintly audible through the thunder and rain.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, everyone spotted the points of light, instantly recognizing them as the escape lights of cultivators. Moreover, the arrivals were powerful, at least Foundation Establishment stage cultivators.</p><p>Upon hearing the shout, everyone subconsciously slowed their attack, exchanging glances, their expressions a mix of surprise and tension.</p><p>On the open sea, without rules, snatching spoils from the jaws of death was commonplace.</p><p>Their hunt for the Kui dragon, though intense, had been efficient, wasting little time. The battle hadn’t dragged on, yet it had still attracted other cultivators, and powerful ones at that!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others looked towards the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>The newcomers seemed hostile and strong.  If they intended to fight for the Kui dragon, another battle was unavoidable.</p><p>They had been manipulating the Freezing Wind Fierce Array for so long, consuming a large amount of true energy.</p><p>After the death of the Kui dragon, its body would belong to Fang.  They would receive nothing; no one wanted to fight others while depleted, especially for an outsider.</p><p>Moreover, with the Kui dragon still alive and these new arrivals, they were facing a crisis on all sides.</p><p>Fang gripped his blood sword, silent, his gaze fixed on the approaching lights.</p><p>…</p><p>In a distant area of the sea, several figures clad in black robes lurked beneath the waves.</p><p>These figures blended with the water, rising and falling with the surface, their auras extremely faint.  Their vision pierced the water, allowing them to vaguely see the battle on the island.</p><p>They too had spotted the uninvited guests.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The Second Senior Brother’s voice was low, a voice transmission to the others. “Quickly! Raise the Beast King Banner!”</p><p>Without a word, they sat cross-legged underwater, forming a circle.</p><p>Around them, numerous banners appeared out of thin air—banners that were already there, now spinning.  The banners were golden, each depicting a different demonic beast.</p><p>Counting them, there were eighty-one!</p><p>At their command, the beasts on the banners came alive, emitting silent roars, a strange power quickly connecting all the banners.</p><p>Each person controlled a portion of the banners, with the Second Senior Brother controlling twice as many as anyone else, visibly straining, his breathing heavy.</p><p>“Second Senior Brother, are there any Nascent Soul stage cultivators among them? What if…what if something happens to the First Senior Brother…?”</p><p>With the formation set, they remained motionless, awaiting their opportunity. A junior brother nervously asked a question.</p><p>The Second Senior Brother glared. “Bad luck! With First Senior Brother’s wisdom, he wouldn't be unprepared. If there were any Nascent Soul stage cultivators, he would have already escaped! From now on, everyone uses their full power on the Beast King Banner. Remember, let none escape!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the small island.</p><p>Everyone looked at the young man surnamed Fang, awaiting his decision.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's face paled, then flushed. He glared at the approaching figure, thrusting his blood-red sword at the Kuilong and shouting, "Kill!"</p><p>"They're fast and strong. We might not be able to kill the Kuilong in time…"  裘季 warned Fang.</p><p>The other four remained motionless. The Heavenly Cold Gale Array spun, its icy power restraining the Kuilong, but not subduing it.  Without the array's full cooperation, the blood-red sword's power was diminished, and despite the Kuilong's desperate counterattacks, Fang's attacks repeatedly failed.</p><p>Chu Heng, at the array's core, sat cross-legged on the crystal stele, eyes closed, silent. Ma Debao's eyes darted around; he exchanged a glance with Qin Sang and the others, agreeing with Qiu Ji's assessment.</p><p>Luo Kun, usually quiet, finally spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang coughed lightly and added his agreement. He was in good condition; the approaching cultivators weren't strong enough to make him flee, but he wasn't inclined to fight strangers without reason.</p><p>Fang had only promised payment for killing the Kuilong, not for fighting other cultivators.</p><p>Fang, his face dark with anger, glared at them one by one. After a moment's silence, he said, "Once this beast is dead, I'll take only the dragon sinew.  My promised reward remains unchanged. The rest, you five can divide equally.  Agreed?"</p><p>They exchanged glances, their hearts pounding.  The Kuilong's most valuable parts were its core, sinew, bones, and hide. Fang only wanted the sinew, offering the core for sharing—a generous offer indeed.</p><p>The Kuilong's core likely contained abundant thunder power, making it exceptionally rare and valuable, either for crafting thunder talismans or selling to thunder cultivators.  Its worth far surpassed that of other demonic beasts.</p><p>Seasoned fighters and decisive individuals, they agreed without hesitation, pressing their palms to the crystal stele, unleashing a torrent of True Qi.</p><p>Though outwardly furious, Fang was calm inside.  He coldly snorted, said nothing more, and redoubled his attack with the blood-red sword.</p><p>The Kuilong was suddenly in grave danger.  Its wounds deepened, its thunderous aura weakened, its immense body stained crimson with blood—a horrific sight.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others intensified their attack, forcing the Kuilong into a desperate retreat, even knocking it from the sky with a screech of agony.</p><p>Distant cultivators, spotting the Kuilong's plight, were shocked and enraged.</p>
