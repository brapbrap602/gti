<h1>Chapter 1300:  The Withering Essence Pill</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A figure sped toward them, Feng Laoguai, sensing the disturbance.</p><p>Feng Laoguai’s speed was incredible, rapidly closing the distance.  His appearance had drastically changed; he no longer looked human.  Eagle wings, snake scales, deer antlers, leopard tail—his features, while still present, were distorted and terrifying.</p><p>Many cultivators, upon seeing Feng Laoguai’s monstrous form, were terrified, unsure if he was man or beast.</p><p>Unknown to them, this was a result of Feng Laoguai’s unique stitching technique. From the beginning of his cultivation, he had been integrating parts of demonic beasts into his own body, forging a demonic form.  As his cultivation progressed, reaching the Yuan Ying stage, the integrated demonic body also transformed, becoming even more powerful. His real name was Feng Xuegan, but it was this technique that earned him the moniker ‘Laoguai’ (Old Monster).</p><p>This demonic transformation imbued Feng Laoguai with a greater aura of violence; his eyes were fierce, radiating a terrifying killing intent as he glared at Qu Huan.</p><p>“Feng Laoguai’s demonic form is becoming increasingly bizarre. While powerful, he’s likely integrated too many disparate things into his body, hindering his cultivation for years. No wonder he consumed so many Withering Essence Pills—a shame he’ll be returning them,”</p><p>Qu Huan chuckled softly, his tone laced with sarcasm, as he watched Feng Laoguai approach.  About to be surrounded by two Yuan Ying masters, he showed no fear, completely unconcerned.</p><p>A flicker of suspicion crossed the Qi cultivator’s eyes. He stared at Qu Huan for a moment, a sudden sense of foreboding washing over him. He instantly raised a hand, unleashing a claw-like attack.</p><p>The claw shadow, without hesitation, struck towards Qu Huan.  The air distorted where it passed, radiating intense heat; it was fiery red, like flowing magma.  A scorching gale swept in.</p><p>Qu Huan didn’t dare to receive the attack head-on and retreated swiftly.</p><p>At that moment, Feng Laoguai, who had been rapidly approaching, vanished, reappearing instantly behind Qu Huan. He raised his claws, fused with some unknown beast’s limbs, and savagely plunged them into Qu Huan's body!</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The claws brutally tore out a section of Qu Huan’s spine.</p><p>Qu Huan’s eyes widened, his body stiffening before being ripped apart by Feng Laoguai.</p><p>Flesh and bone scattered everywhere.</p><p>Qu Huan appeared to be dead.</p><p>However, both Feng Laoguai and the Qi cultivator were furious rather than pleased.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Feng Laoguai spat out a ball of dark light, instantly eradicating Qu Huan’s remains and the intangible poison in the air.  His demonic body leaped, agile as a cheetah, landing on the city wall, his gaze fixed on the Lotus Formation.</p><p>At that moment, figures descended from the sky, landing beside them—the other Yuan Ying cultivators who had returned.</p><p>They had lost track of Ye Laomo.</p><p>While Cang Hong Zhenren, Qiu Zhi Xianzi, and others still had the strength to pursue, the rest had to return.  Like Feng Laoguai, they had missed their target, failing to intercept Qu Huan’s true body.</p><p>“Facing imminent death, you still engage in internal strife.  A bunch of fools!”</p><p>Qu Huan’s arrogant laughter echoed from outside the city.</p><p>It turned out that Qu Huan had prepared an escape route beforehand.  His surprise attack on the Qi cultivator failed, and sensing danger, he decisively fled Yu City.  He was lucky; even a moment’s delay would have resulted in him being surrounded by Yuan Ying cultivators, leaving him no chance of escape.</p><p>Qu Huan’s taunts continued.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Enraged, several cultivators, including Feng Laoguai, immediately pursued him. Qu Huan knew too many secrets of the Abyss. If the Two Realms Alliance learned everything from him, they would be seriously disadvantaged.</p><p>The Qi cultivator was overwhelmed with shame and anger.</p><p>Ye Laomo's betrayal and massacre had caused a dramatic turn of events, marking the most perilous moment for the Abyss. Under such circumstances, internal traitors were unacceptable.</p><p>Their seemingly simple scheme had unexpectedly uncovered a high-ranking traitor, who had subsequently escaped.</p><p>“Qu has been lurking for so long and achieved so much; his cunning is evident.  Catching him wasn't easy.  Exposing the traitor is already a success. Daoist Qi, don’t blame yourself.  Quickly deploy city defenses and restore order.  Working together, we will overcome this,”</p><p>A beautiful female cultivator stepped forward, speaking softly and soothingly to the Qi cultivator.</p><p>The Qi cultivator nodded, regaining his composure.  “Zhenren and Qiu Zhi Xianzi haven’t returned? You didn’t catch Ye Laomo?”</p><p>The female cultivator looked sad, sighing, “Even heavily wounded, Ye Laomo’s escape speed far surpasses ours. We were quickly left behind.  Also, the backlash suffered by several fellow cultivators is worsening, and difficult to suppress. Fearing Ye Laomo might take advantage, Zhenren ordered us to return while they continued the pursuit.”</p><p>The female cultivator gestured to a Yuan Ying cultivator seated in meditation beside her.  One young man stood out; his dark hair and beard were rapidly turning white, his face creased with wrinkles, his skin losing its luster.  He seemed to age decades in moments.  His breath was shallow and ragged, his energy visibly waning.</p><p>Their condition mirrored that of the recently attacked Feng, though the severity varied among them.  Despite witnessing Feng's suffering, the Qi cultivator felt a chill run down his spine, grateful he hadn't taken the Withering Essence Pill.</p><p>"Where is Ye trying to escape to?"  the Qi cultivator asked, regaining his composure.</p><p>"Before we returned, we saw him fly towards the Sky Scar.  He's likely heading for the Abyssal Ruins," the female cultivator said grimly.</p><p>"Could it be...?" The Qi cultivator's eyes widened in shock.  "He can open the Sinful God Palace?"</p><p>Since its discovery, the Sinful God Palace had always mirrored the Purple Micro Palace. It was clear the time for the Purple Micro Palace's emergence hadn't arrived. Unless Ye had forcibly opened the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>"It all began with Ye and the True Person.  They killed a demon within the Sinful God Palace. I can't fathom how he did it, or what his intentions are, but it’s clearly connected to the Palace. His knowledge of it surpasses everyone else’s."</p><p>A hint of regret flickered across the female cultivator’s face. "Ye is grievously wounded.  Only escaping into the Sinful God Palace could save him. He must have planned this for a long time, confident in his ability to escape.  We were all blinded, completely unaware for all these years."</p><p>Her words implied she had little faith in True Person Cang Hong capturing Ye.</p><p>Noticing her pessimism, the Qi cultivator offered reassurance, "These are just speculations. Ye may not be capable of that. The True Person will send word soon.  Holding the Yu City is the priority."</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the others were battling their way through a large formation. The Lotus Formation; each petal was a layer of restriction. To reach Yu City, they had to break through multiple layers.  They had discovered Yu City was undefended, a golden opportunity.  Holding nothing back, they unleashed their full power, breaking through half the restrictions in a short time.</p>
