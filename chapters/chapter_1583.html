<h1>Chapter 1574: Array within an Array</h1><p>Chapter 1574: Array within an Array</p><p>Yuefei had previously tried to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Now, she seemed to harbor intense hatred for Old Man Yanshan.  Her usually alluring eyes blazed with fury, and she relentlessly unleashed her magical artifacts and spells upon him.</p><p>As the beloved concubine of Lu Laomo’s adopted son, Yuefei naturally possessed a wealth of magical artifacts.  The loss of her light gauze artifact at the beginning of the battle had little impact on her. Following the thunder pearl and silver bracelet, she instantly produced a crystal dagger adorned with beaded tassels from her pouch.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan struggled to cope, his movements frantic.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and continued to break the array. He had already analyzed the internal structure and pathways of the spirit array; the process would become smoother from here on.</p><p>The speed of the Snow-Treading Divine Blade increased, embedding glyphs resembling strange scribbles into the spirit array, causing its appearance to change drastically.</p><p>“It’s done…”</p><p>Qin Sang was over seventy percent confident.  Lu Ye was nearby; escape was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer. With a flick of his finger, the Snow-Treading Divine Blade flew back into his hand, its blade’s energy continuously connected to the array.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The divine blade returned to its normal size.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped into the air, taking a commanding position from above. His internal True Qi surged, driving the Snow-Treading Divine Blade in a diagonal slash through the void.</p><p>The slash, seemingly light and gentle, emitted a relatively faint blade glow. The light, fluttering blade energy, like a thin feather, appeared slow yet was remarkably fast as it landed on the surface of the spirit array without a trace of smoke or fire.</p><p>Simultaneously, the sword energy Qin Sang had left in the array base erupted in response.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>Like hot water meeting snow.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade effortlessly left a nearly hundred-zhang-long cut on the ice, slicing almost against the ice pillar into the very center of the spirit array.</p><p>This strike perfectly severed the array’s intricate energies, dismantling it with maximum efficiency—a flawless, sublime maneuver!</p><p>Qin Sang’s success was due in no small part to the assistance of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan couldn’t help but exclaim, “Excellent!”</p><p>“It’s done!” Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>While it looked effortless, it had actually been extremely taxing.</p><p>With a single strike, the spirit array remained visually the same, but its feel was entirely different.</p><p>The glyphs in the array base dimmed one by one, accelerating rapidly. In the blink of an eye, most of the array base was obscured in darkness, its power dissipating at an alarming rate.</p><p>Seeing the change in the spirit array, Yuefei became anxious, using the crystal dagger to entangle Old Man Yanshan’s thin rope. She bit her tongue, spitting out a cloud of blood that poured into the silver bracelet.</p><p>The silver bracelet instantly turned blood red, absorbing the blood and radiating an eerie glow—clearly an evil artifact.</p><p>With a *hum*, the bracelet split into two, moving towards Old Man Yanshan in a snapping motion.</p><p>The whooshing sound drew Old Man Yanshan’s attention back.  Seeing the imposing force of the bracelet, he dared not be negligent, rapidly forming an extremely complex hand seal.</p><p>The dragon-head shield was still resisting the thunder pearl. The thunder pearl continued to unleash frantic bolts of lightning.</p><p>The dragon-head shield’s material was clearly extraordinary; the lightning’s corrosive power was ineffective against it, only able to break through the water curtain without harming the shield itself.</p><p>The shield trembled violently, generating a tangible ripple that, like a water wave, attacked the thunder pearl with lightning speed.</p><p>This move instantly reversed the offensive and defensive positions.  The ripple forcefully extinguished the pink lightning, striking the thunder pearl.</p><p>The thunder pearl was flung into the air by a powerful force.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan immediately recalled the dragon-head shield and repeated the tactic, using it to defend against the silver bracelet.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this played perfectly into Yuefei’s plan. The silver bracelet had been targeting the dragon-head shield all along. The two halves of the bracelet twisted, transforming into two soft, bloodworm-like entities.  Instead of retreating, they advanced, wrapping around the approaching dragon-head shield from left and right, connecting at their ends.</p><p>In an instant, the dragon-head shield was tightly bound by a blood ring.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan was slightly stunned. He hurriedly urged the dragon-head shield, causing the shield to vibrate violently with a buzzing sound. However, the blood ring proved exceptionally resilient, and he couldn't break free immediately.</p><p>At the same time, Old Man Yanshan noticed something unusual about Yuefei, recalling a previous scene. He quickly descended, forcefully tapping the ice beneath his feet.</p><p>A silver light shone on the ice, like a layer of silver powder—precisely the drop of water Old Man Yanshan had sprinkled earlier, which he had not yet retracted.</p><p>This was a refined spiritual water he had cultivated over many years, falsely claiming it to be the legendary Heavenly River water from the immortal realm, presumptuously calling it Primal Heavy Water.  True Primal Heavy Water was legendary; this imitation naturally couldn't compare, but it possessed the characteristic of being as heavy as a thousand jun, with the ability to gather and disperse at will, making it incredibly versatile.</p><p>The silver powder rapidly gathered at Old Man Yanshan's feet, seeping beneath the ice.  From a distance, one could see a sudden layer of vertical silver foil appear within the ice.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice cave trembled, a clang of metal on metal echoing within.  A figure burst from the ice – Yuefei, attempting her old trick of infiltrating the ice to steal the Cold Crystal.  But her path was blocked by the Primal Heavy Water, her abilities seen through by Old Man Yanshan.</p><p>Old Man Yanshan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Ice shards flew everywhere.  Yuefei, instead of forcing her way through, broke free of the ice and charged at Old Man Yanshan, her body a blade, a suicidal attack.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang had darted to the side of the ice pillar, hand reaching for the Cold Crystal, when his eyes froze.</p><p>Inside the ice pillar, a strange blue light silently brewed.  Not only the pillar, but the entire ice cave, from top to bottom, left to right, was filled with blue points of light, brilliant as stars.</p><p>An array within an array!</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled.  He shouted, “Careful!”</p><p>…</p><p>While the fierce battle raged in the ice cave…</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body entered the snowy plains, descended underground, and found the source of the disturbance.  A massive ice storm greeted him.</p><p>Looking down from above, he saw a swirling vortex at the storm’s center.  Biting winds whipped ice chunks in a rapidly rotating spiral.  The bottom of the spiral led to an unknown place. Qin Sang could sense his clone and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly were within.</p><p>The ice storm’s range and power far surpassed its initial intensity.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, activating his protective true energy, and plunged into the storm.</p><p>*Whoosh! Bang! Bang! Bang…*</p><p>The sound of the wind.</p><p>The sound of ice striking his protective true energy.</p><p>Chaos surrounded Qin Sang.  He could barely see anything.  His spiritual senses were also limited. He recognized the power of a spirit array, but sensed no barriers.</p><p>After descending some distance, Qin Sang discovered the main factor obscuring his spiritual senses and hindering his connection with his clone was the chaotic, frigid煞 energy.</p><p>“This level of spirit array poses no threat to my clone…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, but remained vigilant.</p><p>As he went deeper, his connection with his clone and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly improved slightly.  However, ice chunks continued to bombard him, the frigid煞 energy dense, still insufficient for him to perceive their thoughts.</p><p>After a short time, Qin Sang sensed something behind him.</p><p>Soon after Qin Sang entered the ice storm, Wu Lao, having been sent to pursue Yuefei, was drawn in by the storm’s fluctuations.  He hadn't found Yuefei outside, suspecting she might be inside, and charged in.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Lao were now approaching from opposite directions.  Both intending to surprise their target, they'd suppressed their auras; neither had detected the other outside.</p><p>However, inside the ice storm, they had to resist the onslaught of the frigid煞 energy, making stealth impossible.</p><p>As Qin Sang discovered Wu Lao, Wu Lao sensed someone ahead!</p><p>“Someone’s coming from behind!”</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, a sudden warning arising. His expression darkened; he spun around, his Qianjun Ring flashing, launching a lightning-fast arc of sword energy.</p><p>A sharp *clink*.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword blocked Qin Sang, meeting a black iron hook.</p><p>Wu Lao, tasked with assisting Yuefei and concerned for her safety, knew anyone encountered here was either Yuefei or an enemy – to be killed without hesitation.  Therefore, he attacked without a second thought.</p><p>The iron hook, known as the Bone-Melting Hook, was an extremely insidious weapon, difficult to defend against. Countless cultivators had died by it.</p><p>To Wu Lao’s surprise, the Bone-Melting Hook was easily blocked.</p><p>Sword and hook clashed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of churning blood, the hook's energy affecting him.  If he hadn’t cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Body Refining*, possessing the physique of a demon king, he would have suffered a major setback.</p><p>Without hesitation, ignoring the roiling blood, he followed the direction of the hook's attack, locating the attacker, and retaliated with a Heavenly Thunder strike!</p><p>A clap of thunder.</p><p>The Summoning Thunder technique unleashed.</p><p>Lightning erupted from the storm, blindingly bright, its power earth-shattering.</p><p>Wu Lao felt a searing pain at the top of his head, his hairs standing on end. He let out a long howl, spitting out a blob of blood – a thumb-sized blood jade.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>At the last moment, the blood jade blocked the lightning.  Its light instantly dimmed, and it was knocked away.</p><p>Wu Lao quickly dodged to the side, recovering the blood jade.  Seeing its dimmed radiance, he forgot his pain, still slightly shaken, deeply regretting his overconfidence.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed too.</p><p>Instantaneous Summoning Thunder was perfect for surprise attacks and eliminating foes.</p><p>However, as his cultivation increased and his true energy deepened, the proportion of true energy he used in the Summoning Thunder technique decreased, its power failing to keep pace, destined to become gradually weaker.</p><p>Now, wielding lightning magic is considered a top-tier ability, but it's no longer capable of the miraculous feats it could achieve at the Golden Core stage, such as rivaling Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>"Late Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Lao Wu recognized their opponent and were both shocked.</p><p>Encountering such a powerful cultivator in such a remote area was baffling to Qin Sang. He felt fortunate that his main body had followed him, preventing a repeat of a previous misfortune.</p><p>But then again, it made sense.</p><p>At his level, only extremely rare treasures could pique his interest, and those eligible to compete for them would undoubtedly be cultivators of comparable strength.</p><p>The incident his clone encountered was likely no accident!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>Lao Wu scrutinized Qin Sang, coldly demanding, "Who are you! Did you kill Yuefei?"</p><p>Although Yuefei possessed a protective treasure gifted by her master, she had been kept like a caged bird in Luye, her horizons limited.  She only sparred with a few Moon Guard, who never truly fought her, always holding back.</p><p>If she encountered a powerful cultivator, Lao Wu doubted she could escape.</p><p>"What Yuefei?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, understanding that something had gone wrong below. He immediately attacked with his sword!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword pierced towards Lao Wu's face, like another thunderbolt.</p><p>This time, Lao Wu was prepared. He wielded his Bone-Devouring Hook, creating multiple shadowy hooks aimed at the sword, intending to trap it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the Golden Sinking Sword approached, Lao Wu noticed something unusual about the sword light, a sudden sense of danger.</p><p>Without hesitation, he retracted the Bone-Devouring Hook, struck his Dantian, and shot out an object that expanded rapidly in the wind—a short halberd.</p><p>This treasure, the Blood Drinking Demon Halberd, was Lao Wu's life-bound artifact.</p><p>He hadn't expected to be forced to use it defensively so early in the fight.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Golden Sinking Sword flew towards him, its light blurring before suddenly disappearing.</p><p>Immediately after, the surrounding ice storm froze.</p><p>The white ice spheres seemed to be covered with a layer of gray gauze, like an invisible curtain, expanding at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang unleashed his ultimate move.</p><p>Having broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, the power of his sword formation was vastly improved.</p><p>Lao Wu was too slow to react. He felt his vision suddenly darken, countless sword threads appearing out of thin air. This was a sword technique he had never seen before. The sword energy caused a throbbing pain in his soul, even giving him the illusion of being pierced internally, chilling him to the bone.</p><p>The sword threads trembled, strangling him.</p><p>"Heaven-Stabilizing Halberd!"</p><p>Lao Wu retreated, shouting.</p><p>The Blood Drinking Demon Halberd seemed to have a seal broken, its edges glowing crimson, like drops of blood moving, emitting a pungent bloody smell.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Without any visible movement from Lao Wu,</p><p>The Blood Drinking Demon Halberd vanished.</p><p>This wasn't true disappearance, but the result of extreme speed.</p><p>In an instant, the Blood Drinking Demon Halberd struck countless times, thousands of halberd shadows appearing in the void, dense and close together. Wherever the shadows touched, the void seemed to solidify, worthy of its name, "Heaven-Stabilizing."</p><p>The sword formation and halberd shadows collided, a deafening roar filling the air.</p><p>Sword threads and halberd shadows annihilated each other.</p><p>Lao Wu seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>The result was a draw.</p><p>"Pseudo-Spiritual Treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, fixated on the Blood Drinking Demon Halberd.</p><p>Judging by its power, it was inferior to Yin Changsheng's Hanging Sword Tower, and likely had other untapped abilities.</p><p>However, the Hanging Sword Tower had been refined by Yin Changsheng using the "Sacrifice Essence Technique" for countless years. Below the Transformation God stage, few could refine their life-bound artifacts to that level.</p><p>Concerned about his clone, Qin Sang didn't want to prolong the fight and swiftly descended.</p><p>Lao Wu was still savoring the Seven Souls Killing Formation; he paused, then realized Qin Sang's destination. He immediately pursued him, shouting, "This is a Luye secret treasure! You dare be so brazen! Retreat at once, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p>Hearing "Luye," Qin Sang's expression grew even more serious.</p><p>This person possessed a pseudo-spiritual treasure, certainly someone influential. Could he be a descendant of Old Demon Lu?</p><p>This was the second time someone had threatened him since arriving in the Central Plains.</p><p>Did descendants of Transformation God cultivators all act so arrogantly?</p><p>Qin Sang grumbled inwardly, but he wouldn't be intimidated.  Reuniting with his clone was his priority.</p><p>The chase continued.</p><p>During the pursuit, Qin Sang approached the ice cave, and the connection with his clone became increasingly clear. He could vaguely sense their thoughts.</p><p>"It's Luye! Stop him!"</p><p>His main body finally understood the situation—it was two against one, and the situation was under control. All he had to do was stop the old man from interfering.</p><p>The main body immediately stopped, sheathed his sword, waved his sleeves, and a black light flashed from his forehead as the Fire Lotus Seed shot out.</p><p>Demonic flames erupted!</p>
