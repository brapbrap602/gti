<h1>Chapter 626: The Choice</h1><p>Chapter 626: The Choice</p><p>In this way, this person, while existing in the form of an insect Gu, possessed the power of a Yuan Ying stage cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang, upon seeing this account in the jade slip, found it incredibly strange.  It was comparable to Wu Shang, who had attempted to become a living corpse to achieve Golden Core,  a desperate measure.</p><p>The difference was that Wu Shang failed.</p><p>The rumored Fang cultivator succeeded, merging with their own life-bound insect Gu, transforming into an insect.</p><p>The rumor isn't very old. If this person truly existed, they might still be alive.</p><p>Qin Sang was very curious.  He decided to inquire after leaving the Western Frontier to see if such a ruthless person really existed.</p><p>Life-bound insect Gu have many advantages. Not only can they assist in breakthroughs, but if they transform with the cultivator's rising cultivation, their power surpasses that of a life-bound magical treasure. In battle, they act independently, effectively making it two against one.</p><p>Not to mention that many spirit insects possess unique talents and abilities.</p><p>Of course, the premise is that the life-bound insect Gu can transform in time to keep pace with its master.</p><p>Spirit insect transformation is incredibly difficult, even harder than a cultivator's breakthrough.</p><p>Refining a spirit insect into a life-bound insect Gu, while possible through bloodline cultivation and unique insect-controlling techniques that aid transformation, remains extremely challenging.</p><p>Much like human cultivators after Golden Core, many only use talisman treasures for show, spending decades or even centuries searching for materials to refine a life-bound magical treasure.</p><p>Many Witch Clan cultivators, after Golden Core, find their life-bound insect Gu stuck at the second transformation, desperately searching for spiritual objects and elixirs to help them transform.</p><p>Finding a suitable life-bound insect Gu and knowing the exact materials to aid its transformation can significantly reduce the effort.</p><p>The core of the insect-controlling techniques of the major Witch Clan factions lies in this.</p><p>The criteria for the Witch Insect Ranking are also related to this.</p><p>The bloodline potential of the spirit insect is only one part.</p><p>The Witch Clan compiles the Witch Insect Ranking for most of its cultivators to refer to. The higher-ranked insects are not necessarily those with the highest potential.</p><p>To be ranked, a spirit insect must have the potential for a second transformation.</p><p>A third transformation potential is ideal; beyond that, the difference is negligible.</p><p>Furthermore,</p><p>the combat strength of the spirit insect in its first three transformations, and the difficulty of its transformations, especially the second and third,</p><p>are the most important factors determining its ranking on the Witch Insect Ranking.</p><p>Those rare spirit insects with the potential for a fifth, sixth, or even higher transformation are considered extraordinary insects by the Spirit Controlling Sect, yet rank very low on the Witch Insect Ranking.</p><p>Firstly, they are weak in the early stages, with inconspicuous abilities, unable to demonstrate combat strength.</p><p>Secondly, their transformation is extremely difficult, and the necessary medicinal herbs are hard to find.</p><p>Such insects, when used as life-bound insect Gu, would only hinder progress.</p><p>Devilhead Bees are not individually strong in their first transformation.  They only become formidable when attacking in swarms.</p><p>However, after the second and third transformations, the Devilhead Bee's combat strength undergoes a qualitative leap.  Therefore, despite the high difficulty of transformation, they still rank in the top five hundred.</p><p>Of course, the ranking on the Witch Insect Ranking is one thing; whether you can find one is another.</p><p>Qin Sang brought out both the Witch Insect Ranking and the Extraordinary Insect Ranking.</p><p>He believed that before Golden Core, choosing a life-bound insect Gu according to the Witch Insect Ranking was definitely correct. But now that he has achieved Golden Core, it's best to refer to the Extraordinary Insect Ranking as well, considering both the insect's potential and its future when selecting a life-bound insect Gu.</p><p>This highlights the value of the Extraordinary Insect Ranking. The transformation methods for those extraordinary insects listed, can reach even the fourth and fifth transformations, and are very detailed.  The only problem is the scarcity of resources.</p><p>This Witch Insect Ranking is a common and widely circulated list among the Witch Clan.</p><p>Among the five insects listed, the Five Insect Sect possesses unique insect-controlling techniques—the core of their true inheritance. Qin Sang swore to never reveal them, which is why Cui Xuanzi was willing to share it.</p><p>Major factions undoubtedly possess similar secret techniques.  These are all closely guarded secrets.</p><p>It is unknown whether the insect-controlling techniques of those major Witch Clan factions are richer and more detailed than this Extraordinary Insect Ranking.</p><p>Insect-controlling techniques are extremely complex. Qin Sang spent a long time reviewing the entire list.</p><p>After reviewing this information, Qin Sang made up his mind to select a suitable spirit insect to refine into his life-bound insect Gu, replacing his life-bound magical treasure.</p><p>There are many reasons.</p><p>Human cultivators dare not take this path for fear of backlash from the life-bound insect Gu; Qin Sang, possessing the Jade Buddha, can perfectly avoid such risks.</p><p>In fact, even those in the Witch Clan are not as fortunate.</p><p>In time, Qin Sang could allow his life-bound insect Gu to undergo the fourth transformation without reservation.</p><p>Even at the False Dan stage, he could easily control the Flying Night Rakshasa.  Yi Tiannie, despite his best efforts, couldn't erase the soul mark – a testament to the jade Buddha's power.</p><p>Qin Sang was immediately captivated by the life-worm's ability to aid in breakthrough cultivation.</p><p>Reflecting on the past, Qin Sang could imagine the immense difficulty of his future Core Formation.</p><p>He was unsure if a single Du E Dan could help him achieve Core Formation.</p><p>Yet, he would grasp any chance, however small.  Even without the jade Buddha removing hidden dangers, Qin Sang would have sought a way to cultivate a life-worm.</p><p>Since there were no lingering concerns, he couldn't miss this opportunity.</p><p>Furthermore, the knowledge from the ancient texts of the Yu Ling Sect, especially the insect-controlling techniques unknown even to the Witch Clan, and the Crimson Fire Gilded he possessed, gave Qin Sang the confidence to pursue this path.</p><p>Crimson Gold Vine absorbs the world's gold spirit fire energy, bearing fruit – an immature form of Crimson Fire Gilded.</p><p>Originally intended for refining weapons.</p><p>A Yu Ling Sect elder once discovered an ancient beast-controlling manual within an ancient cultivator's relic.</p><p>He found that if the Crimson Gold Vine fruit wasn't smelted, but its juice extracted and fed to spirit insects, it had a chance of helping them break through to the next stage!</p><p>At the ancient cultivator's relic, Qin Sang witnessed firsthand how Old Man Di Que fed Crimson Fire Gilded to his Fire Jade Centipedes, immediately triggering their transformation.</p><p>After obtaining the Crimson Fire Gilded, Qin Sang focused on improving his cultivation and repairing his foundation, leaving little time for insect control.</p><p>He was lucky to encounter a Ghost Head Bee, but it was a mutated one, incapable of further advancement and transformation.</p><p>This resulted in the Crimson Fire Gilded lying unused in his spatial pouch – a brilliant pearl hidden from view.</p><p>Now, the Crimson Fire Gilded finally had a purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang only had one Crimson Gold Vine fruit, but since one can only have one life-worm, it should be enough to support the life-worm through its third transformation, with some to spare.</p><p>For Qin Sang, cultivating a third-stage life-worm seemed highly likely.  Then, spending a few hundred years preparing the spirit herbs needed for the fourth transformation would be far more efficient than aimless cultivation.</p><p>After his talent was enhanced by the Killing Talisman, Qin Sang’s cultivation speed was above average, allowing him to pursue multiple goals simultaneously.</p><p>However, these were not the initial reasons that led Qin Sang to choose the path of the life-worm.</p>
