<h1>Chapter 1627: The Qilin Screen Wall</h1><p>The terrain within the Ice Instrument Palace wasn't overly complex.</p><p>Besides two paths leading to side halls, the central path was almost entirely straight, leading directly to the palace at the deepest part.</p><p>Along the way, there were a number of smaller branching paths where one could glimpse the shadows of huts and smaller halls. These likely weren't particularly important locations, most probably caves and other functional halls prepared for the Ice Palace disciples.</p><p>Having gained a general understanding of the Ice Instrument Palace layout, the avatar seldom paused.</p><p>He continued until he emerged from the forest.</p><p>The avatar saw a courtyard ahead of the stone path, with a screen wall standing before it. The only spirit beast depicted on the screen wall was the Qilin, eight in total.</p><p>Each Qilin had a different expression, as if frolicking amidst the riverbank's ripples.  Some raised their heads, some lowered them, some stood still, some leaped – each posture unique.</p><p>It was a depiction of Qilins playing in water.</p><p>Having been untended for years, the colors on the screen wall were faded, the patterns mottled, giving it an extraordinarily ancient appearance.</p><p>Through the sides of the screen wall, one could see glimpses of the scenery within the courtyard: pavilions, waterside gazebos, stone sculptures of artificial mountains – quite elegant. It was likely a place where Ice Instrument Palace cultivators once took pleasure.</p><p>Like the small lake before.</p><p>This place, too, lacked any strong restrictive fluctuations. The courtyard was desolate, and even the Qilin screen wall had partially collapsed.  Presumably, there had been even more Qilins in the original design.</p><p>However, the avatar's gaze passed over the screen wall and saw a deep blue light pervading the depths of the courtyard, awe-inspiring and soul-stirring.  Clearly, a powerful formation or restriction existed within.</p><p>This was undoubtedly good news.</p><p>If the Ice Instrument Palace's formations had been completely destroyed, the treasures within would surely have been plundered.</p><p>The avatar habitually sensed his surroundings, finding nothing unusual.  His steps didn't falter as he flashed towards the courtyard. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, his eyes instantly turning deathly white.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A blinding white, icy light erupted, shooting directly towards the screen wall.</p><p>He'd unhesitatingly unleashed the Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>Simultaneously, icy light blazed from the screen wall, instantly transforming it into a transparent wall of ice. Then, streaks of icy light burst forth from the screen wall, rushing towards him.</p><p>Within the icy light were, astonishingly, ice Qilins.</p><p>At this moment, there were no longer any Qilin images on the screen wall.  These Qilins had, at some unknown point, come to life and charged out of the screen wall, each one incredibly ferocious, radiating a murderous aura.</p><p>Before the Qilins attacked him, the avatar hadn’t detected anything unusual about the screen wall. Unexpectedly, the remaining half of the screen wall also concealed a hidden mechanism.</p><p>Fortunately, the avatar had remained vigilant, secretly accumulating power.</p><p>Uncertain of the situation, he'd immediately unleashed the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>In an instant, the two icy lights clashed. The leading ice Qilin collided directly with the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light wasn’t as imposing as the ice Qilin, but upon contact, it surprisingly suppressed the icy energy surrounding the ice Qilin. Cracking sounds filled the air as a block of ice formed out of thin air.</p><p>The ice Qilin was instantly frozen within.</p><p>However, the avatar was very clear that freezing a single ice Qilin wasn't significant.</p><p>The Qi of all the ice Qilins was connected to the screen wall, forming a unified whole.  The combined attack of eight ice Qilins was absolutely more terrifying than a single one.</p><p>Moreover, unless the screen wall was destroyed or the power of the screen wall's restriction was exhausted, these Qilins were essentially immortal.</p><p>Even with the ability to protect himself, the avatar couldn't afford to become entangled with the ice Qilins here.  Just as he was about to find a way to force a breakthrough, he witnessed a strange scene.</p><p>The remaining seven ice Qilins, upon seeing the Ice Soul Divine Light, lost much of their ferocity.  Hesitation appeared in their eyes, as if they were unsure whether to rescue their companion.</p><p>For a moment, they abandoned their attack posture and began to pace before him.</p><p>Seeing this, the avatar's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light was cultivated using the mysterious ice disc and carried a unique icy, baleful aura!</p><p>The respite was short-lived. After a brief hesitation, the ferocity in the ice Qilins' eyes returned. With piercing roars, they lunged forward.</p><p>The avatar retreated instead of advancing.  His sleeves billowed as the mysterious ice disc spun and flew before him.</p><p>With the concealing technique withdrawn, the aura of the mysterious ice disc was fully revealed!</p><p>The ice Qilins’ forward momentum abruptly halted, then they all expressed joy.  Under the avatar’s astonished gaze, they circled the ice disc as if in reverence, letting out clear cries.  Ignoring the avatar completely, they returned to the screen wall, once again transforming into the ordinary image of Qilins playing in water.</p><p>“This treasure truly has a deep connection to the Ice Instrument Palace!”</p><p>Having easily overcome a crisis and realized a new power of the mysterious ice disc, the avatar was in high spirits.</p><p>He surmised that the icy, baleful aura carried by the Ice Soul Divine Light was too weak to be recognized.  Only upon seeing the true form of the treasure did these ice Qilins abandon their attack.</p><p>Thinking of this, the avatar simply left the mysterious ice disc floating outside. He glanced at the silent screen wall, pondered briefly, and then turned to wave towards the forest.</p><p>In the next moment, several streaks of white light flew out, all identical ice bees.</p><p>These ice bees were entirely formed from transparent Profound Ice.  Landing in the avatar's hand, they silently melted and vanished.</p><p>This was a warning technique obtained from the Profound Sky Palace.  The avatar left it outside to prevent anyone from unknowingly entering the Ice Palace behind him. While the Ice Palace and the Lang Huan Bell had different origins, it never hurt to be cautious.</p><p>Since there was a screen wall here, there was no need for further measures, which might反而可能被人识破, 使对方心生警惕.  Such measures might inadvertently reveal his presence and alert others.</p><p>The ice Qilins had retreated before a true confrontation, persuaded by the ice disc.  He only needed to erase the fluctuations caused by the Ice Soul Divine Light, and there would be no trace left here.</p><p>This also indirectly proved that he was likely the first to enter.  Others, lacking the mysterious ice disc, would likely leave traces when dealing with the ice Qilins’ attack.</p><p>Having taken care of the aftermath.</p><p>The avatar bypassed the screen wall and entered the courtyard.  After walking for a while, he finally reached the source of the deep blue light. This was the core of the Ice Instrument Palace, the main body of the Ice Palace’s shadow.</p><p>A dilapidated palace came into view, entirely constructed of Profound Ice. Bathed in the deep blue light, it resembled a dream.</p><p>The avatar stood at the foot of the Profound Ice steps and looked up.</p><p>Nine ice pillars stood before the palace, each supported by a statue of a different water-type Divine Beast. Now, only three remained intact; the others were broken.</p><p>The palace gates were long gone, allowing a clear view inside.</p><p>Above was a broken plaque, with only the characters ‘Water Phase’ remaining. The missing characters likely formed the words ‘Palace’ or ‘Hall.’</p><p>“It truly is the Water Phase lineage!”</p><p>With his suspicions confirmed, the avatar nodded silently.</p><p>Remembering the screen wall incident, the avatar kept the mysterious ice disc floating above his head as he ascended the steps, step by step.</p><p>The avatar glanced at the area above the palace.  The deep blue light hung in the air, seemingly solidified.  Even as he approached the palace, it remained motionless.</p><p>He wondered if the deep blue light was merely a reflection from the Ice Palace or if he hadn't yet entered its range of influence.</p><p>Hesitating slightly, the avatar entered the palace.</p><p>His body floated above the ground, not touching anything.</p><p>The palace could only be described as riddled with holes, covered in the scars of battle.  One could imagine how fierce the war had been.</p><p>The restrictions here were severely damaged, and skeletons lay exposed, decayed to ash.  However, many fragments of magical treasures remained, though they had lost their power.</p><p>“This must have been the main battlefield of the Ice Instrument Palace…”</p><p>The avatar imagined the scenes of the past, silently moving forward.</p><p>The palace was even larger than it appeared from outside. Halls connected to one another, almost none having escaped the ravages of war.</p><p>The avatar's speed increased as he traversed the numerous halls.  As he neared what he estimated to be the deepest part of the palace, he suddenly felt an inexplicable sense of oppression, causing him to stop.</p><p>He was currently standing in a corridor between two halls.</p><p>The deep blue light cascaded down, dyeing everything blue.</p><p>The pressure came from the deep blue light.</p><p>At the same time, the avatar noticed that the traces of battle continued forward, not ending here, but the signs of fighting became significantly less frequent.</p><p>The avatar continued walking while sensing the changes in the deep blue light.  He discovered that although he couldn’t control the restrictions here through the mysterious ice disc, as long as he didn’t make any drastic moves, the restrictions wouldn't actively attack him.</p><p>This emboldened the avatar, and he quickly crossed the corridor.</p><p>Arriving before the next hall, the avatar's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>An eye, through the crack in the door, was watching him!</p><p>He subconsciously slowed his pace. Closer inspection revealed it was a statue. True Essence formed into a hand, pushing open the door, allowing him to see the statue's full form.</p><p>The statue was almost as tall as the hall itself, sitting upright, hands resting on its knees.  Its left hand formed a complex hand seal, while its right held a horsetail whisk, appearing detached and refined.</p><p>“Not a deity statue!”</p><p>Based on experience, it was most likely an ancestral statue of the Water Phase lineage.</p><p>The offering table before the ancestral statue was overturned, and even the statue itself was severely damaged. A gash ran across its head, slicing off its right eye and half its face.</p><p>Only its left eye remained, gazing at this silent ruin for countless years.</p><p>Perhaps this ancestor had personally crafted the Ice Palace.</p><p>This sight.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart was suddenly touched.</p><p>The avatar sighed, bowed to the ancestral statue, and glanced around. He discovered another hall behind the statue, but its door was closed.</p><p>The avatar quickly walked over and tried to push the door, but was repelled by a force. Then, a blue light barrier flashed on the door.</p><p>“The restrictions here are still active…”</p><p>The avatar retreated two steps, intending to use the ice disc to open the door, but ultimately failed.</p><p>However, there was good news.  The restrictive backlash would dissipate upon contact with the ice disc, allowing the avatar to break through the restriction without fear of reprisal. This further confirmed his judgment that the ice disc was of utmost importance to the Water Phase lineage!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light reappeared.</p><p>The next moment, a layer of frost covered the door.</p><p>Cracking sounds echoed continuously as the ice layer thickened, freezing the light barrier.</p><p>Then, a flash of sword light erupted from the avatar's palm. The sword light illuminated the hall, striking the center of the ice layer with lightning speed.</p><p>The light barrier trembled, and visible ripples spread outwards.</p><p>The restrictive backlash was fierce, affecting the entire hall. The deep blue light also began to shift.</p><p>Seeing the imminent change.</p><p>The avatar immediately sent the ice disc flying forward.</p><p>Upon contact with the ice disc, the backlash dissipated instantly, and the deep blue light quickly calmed down.</p><p>The avatar’s expression eased slightly, but the light barrier was still stubbornly resisting.  A thought struck him, and he quickly changed his hand seals. A small seal rose into the air.  To save time, he'd directly summoned the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Cold flames surged.</p><p>A fire serpent detached itself from the Four Serpent Seal, its form rapidly shrinking to the size of an arm.  Writhing its small body, it pressed close to the Snow Treading Divine Sword and slammed into the light barrier!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Blinding icy light flashed.</p><p>Shattering sounds erupted.</p><p>The avatar, having unleashed almost all his divine abilities and treasures, finally shattered the light barrier!</p><p>The restrictive backlash was once again blocked by the ice disc, leaving the avatar unharmed.  Waiting for the fluctuations to subside, he flashed through the light barrier and used the Snow Treading Divine Sword to pry open the door.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>As the door opened, the avatar saw a skeleton behind it.</p><p>Its empty eye sockets faced outwards as it toppled over.</p><p>The avatar’s eyes narrowed. He immediately used the Snow Treading Divine Sword to shield himself as the skeleton fell to the ground, instantly weathering into white ash.</p><p>Despite the brief moment, the avatar clearly saw the wound on the skeleton's spine, a near-fatal blow that had nearly severed it in two.</p><p>The skeleton possessed no belongings; a pile of white ash was the last trace it left in the world.  Whether it was a Water Phase cultivator or an enemy was unknown.</p><p>The avatar stepped over the ashes.</p><p>Behind the door was another hall, no smaller than the previous one.  Ice walls divided it into different chambers, and a small portion of the door was ajar.</p><p>The avatar walked in, examining the ice walls on either side.</p><p>The ice walls prevented prying eyes from seeing what lay beyond. He quickly walked to the first door and pushed it open, his eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>Shelves made of Profound Ice filled the chamber, divided into ice compartments of varying sizes, reminding Qin Sang of the Profound Sky Palace's treasury.</p><p>As expected, this was the treasury of the Water Phase lineage!</p><p>Most of the ice compartments were empty, but quite a few treasures remained.  The majority were spiritual materials like rare metals and stones, all of significant value and difficult to find in the outside world.</p><p>"Radiant Divine Stone, Face-Ghost Jade, Purple Soft Gold…"</p><p>While there were no unique, peerless treasures, the sheer quantity still represented considerable wealth.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, most of the treasury’s contents had been taken during the chaos, used to refine magical treasures, artifacts, and formation tools to defend against enemies.  Otherwise, Qin Sang's harvest today could have rivaled that of a major sect.</p><p>The avatar unhesitatingly swept the treasury clean and continued to search the other chambers, but gradually grew disappointed.</p><p>There were chambers for storing spiritual herbs, pills, and magical treasures, but little remained.</p><p>The best-preserved was the Inheritance Hall, where cultivation techniques and secret arts were stored.  Here, the avatar’s harvest was bountiful.  A cursory glance revealed that most were related to the Water Dao, encompassing Daoist, Buddhist, and Demonic arts, truly all-encompassing.</p><p>The avatar found several techniques quite useful to him.</p><p>However, in Qin Sang's eyes, these weren't enough to support the Formless Immortal Sect lineage, indicating that the true inheritance had already been taken!</p><p>The origins of the ice disc and the two spiritual pills remained a mystery. He was far from satisfied.</p><p>Moreover, he hadn't found the core formation hub of the Ice Palace, suggesting there were still secrets to be uncovered!</p><p>After searching, the avatar indeed found a hidden passage at the end of the treasury, leading straight down.  Not far along, he discovered several skeletons lying within the passage.</p><p>The avatar stopped, examining them and noticing that one differed from the others.</p><p>This skeleton had more injuries than the rest, but the avatar judged that it was the last to die.</p><p>The skeleton sat cross-legged in a corner, back against the wall, head tilted upwards. He couldn't sense the emotions from its empty sockets, but a sense of desolation welled up in the avatar's heart.</p><p>Scattered around it were some miscellaneous items and jade bottles, which had likely contained spiritual pills.</p><p>Beneath it was a spiritual formation used for healing.</p><p>However, none of these had prolonged its life.</p><p>It was unknown what this person's cultivation level had been in life, ultimately dying alone here.</p><p>Before him, several items were carefully arranged: jade slips, magical treasures, and some strange tokens, along with an eight-character epitaph – "Disciple Incompetent, Shame Ancestors!"</p>
