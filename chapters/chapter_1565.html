<h1>Chapter 1556: Vacuum Immortal Land</h1><p>“Is Fellow Daoist Qin also nearby? Can you contact him now, Daoist?”</p><p>Lu Zhang’s first question was about Qin Sang’s true body.</p><p>Qin Sang was a little surprised. He couldn't just take Lu Zhang to see his true body, so he said vaguely, “Fellow Daoist Qin has been in secluded cultivation for many years, and it's the most crucial moment. I can only send the message to his cave dwelling. As for when Fellow Daoist Qin will have the leisure, it’s hard to say. Moreover, even if Fellow Daoist Qin receives the message and rushes over, it will take some time… Is Fellow Daoist Lu's matter very urgent?”</p><p>It wasn’t the critical moment for his true body to break through the bottleneck yet, so he could leave seclusion, but it had to be for something extremely important.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang say this, Lu Zhang’s expression clearly revealed disappointment. “Time is what I lack most right now. I can't delay. Otherwise, I could simply return to the Immortal Sect and ask my Senior Sect Master to come out of seclusion. I thought that Fellow Daoist Qin might be traveling with you, Daoist, and I could rely on his ability to see through illusions.”</p><p>Qin Sang let out an “Oh,” suddenly understanding.</p><p>His true body had defeated Cheng Huanzi of the Six Void Sect, shattering the Six Void Mountain with his swordsmanship.  However, any discerning person could see that there must have been some other divine ability to break the illusion, allowing him to accurately pinpoint Cheng Huanzi's true body.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi was the head of a sect, his cultivation no weaker than any of them. There were probably not many people who could easily break through the Six Void Mountain.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was the ability of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly, as his true body's natal insect-gu, was intimately connected to him, greatly beneficial to his cultivation and breakthroughs. Even if the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had its own abilities to conceal itself and preserve its life, it was impossible to let his avatar take it wandering around.</p><p>Lu Zhang sighed, explaining, “I cultivate a Dao Art. If I can perfect this Dao Art, it can nourish my cultivation method in return. However, I've been stuck at the last stage for many years. To perfect this Dao Art, I need to find at least one of several rare treasures in the world and refine it into my body. My Immortal Sect originally knew the whereabouts of one of these treasures, but unexpectedly, an accident occurred, and we failed to obtain it. Over the years, the Immortal Sect has also been helping me search. After so many disappointments, I had almost given up on this path. Unexpectedly, this time I accidentally found a clue in the Chi’nan Island Chain, but the opportunity is fleeting. I must set off immediately and have no time to ask the Immortal Sect for help…”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang roughly understood the reason. “Does this object excel in the art of transformation?”</p><p>“Indeed. Divine objects obscure themselves. These rare treasures naturally possess the instinct for self-preservation. Even if you know their location, it's not easy to find them. I have a magical treasure called the Treasure-Colored Bell, a unique magical treasure with the ability to dispel illusions. But after all, it doesn't specialize in this, unlike Fellow Daoist Qin's divine ability, and it’s somewhat troublesome to use.”</p><p>Saying this, Lu Zhang brushed his hand across his waist, golden light flickering in his palm as an object appeared.</p><p>Judging by its appearance, the Treasure-Colored Bell didn't resemble a bell, but rather a pagoda.</p><p>The Treasure-Colored Bell was square overall, surrounded by layers of ripples. The ripples were uniform, like the tiers of a pagoda, gradually narrowing upwards.</p><p>The inside was hollow and without a clapper.</p><p>Lu Zhang channeled True Essence into it. The Treasure-Colored Bell didn't move, but a clear bell sound rang out. Accompanying the bell sound, ripples of visible, treasure-like light spread out.</p><p>“This treasure uses this treasure-light to dispel illusions. As you can see, Fellow Daoist, to ensure sufficient power, the range is limited, and I must constantly use True Essence to activate it.  While activated, the fluctuations created by the Treasure-Colored Bell cannot be hidden. If I can find that treasure quickly, it's fine, but if it takes too long, I’m worried that I'll consume too much and attract trouble.” Lu Zhang closed his fingers, putting away the Treasure-Colored Bell. “Can you accompany me on this trip, Daoist?  This object is hidden deep within the Southern Province, close to the Savage Province's border. The Unwavering Mountain rarely ventures there.  I’m unfamiliar with the area and need a helper.”</p><p>The Southern and Savage Provinces were very far from the four Northern Provinces, located at the southernmost tip of the Middle Province continent.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't been to the Southern or Savage Provinces before.</p><p>Going straight west from the Chi’nan Island Chain would lead directly to the Southern Province.</p><p>The Savage Province was located southwest of the Southern Province, and it was said to be the largest in area and the most sparsely populated of the Nineteen Provinces of Smoke and Rain.</p><p>Unable to find a better helper for the time being, and in order to persuade Qin Sang, Lu Zhang didn't hesitate to promise a valuable treasure. “Fellow Daoist is proficient in the divine abilities of the Ice Dao. My Senior Sect Master happens to have a unique Cold Crystal containing an extremely Yin and cold Han Sha Qi. If Fellow Daoist can refine it, your divine abilities will be imbued with Han Sha Qi. Regardless of success or failure this time, I will ask my Senior Sect Master for the Cold Crystal as a reward. If you don't need the Cold Crystal, Fellow Daoist, just state your request, and I will do my best.”</p><p>After listening to Lu Zhang's description, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a little tempted.</p><p>For many years, the progress of his Ice Soul Divine Light had been slow, and the righteous path was most likely a dead end.</p><p>Qin Sang had long had an idea, to learn from Liu Li’s past approach, to blaze a new trail, using extremely cold and Yin treasures to forcibly push it up until it reached completion.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light was one of the strongest divine abilities Qin Sang had seen since he started cultivating. Even if his true body advanced to the late stage in the future, it could still provide tremendous help.</p><p>The Yin Li Pearl and the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada’s shed skin were both rare and unpredictable.</p><p>Other treasures might not be compatible with the Ice Soul Divine Light, and Qin Sang wasn’t sure, so he could only try little by little. Special treasures like the Cold Crystal were precisely what he needed.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, asking Lu Zhang about various details. After weighing the pros and cons, he decided to accompany Lu Zhang on this trip.</p><p>Lu Zhang was overjoyed and immediately stood up, impatiently saying, “If you have no other urgent matters, Fellow Daoist, shall we depart now?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his quiet chamber and called Zhou Ruan and his wife over, instructing them to continue staying in the Eastern Sea to observe. After subduing the Blue Sharks, as long as they didn't provoke any Nascent Soul cultivators, their safety could be guaranteed.</p><p>After a stick of incense, Qin Sang left the market with Lu Zhang, heading towards the Southern Province.</p><p>…</p><p>Shuo’nan Port.</p><p>The largest seaport in the Southern Province.</p><p>The Unwavering Mountain had an outpost here.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang made almost no stops along the way, flying to Shuo’nan Port. They found the outpost, adjusted their breathing slightly, requested a map of the Southern Province, and then set off again.</p><p>This time, their direction was southwest.</p><p>Going deeper into the heartland of the Southern Province, the various scenes that appeared before Qin Sang’s eyes gave him a sense of familiarity.</p><p>He quickly recalled the source of this feeling. It was actually the western border of the Wu God Continent in the Canglang Sea, the place where he had fallen after being teleported from the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Both were equally desolate and treacherous.</p><p>Mortals lived in villages, transportation was inconvenient, the environment was isolated, and there were few opportunities for communication with the outside world. Only the northern region, closest to the six provinces of Jiang Zuo, was considered normal, and most of the sects in the Southern Province were gathered there.</p><p>The difference was…</p><p>This place wasn't barren, but miasma was pervasive, multicolored and dangerous everywhere, even posing a threat to cultivators.</p><p>Lu Zhang smiled, “Does Fellow Daoist feel that the Southern Province doesn't live up to its reputation among the Nineteen Provinces of Smoke and Rain? If you have a chance to go to the Savage Province, you’ll know that compared to the Savage Province, the Southern Province is considered a good place.  The Savage Province often has tens of thousands of miles of uninhabited land, more desolate than the Northern Wasteland.  There have long been people suggesting that the Southern and Savage Provinces are not worthy of being listed alongside the other seventeen provinces and should be kicked out. However, legend has it that the Southern and Savage Provinces weren't like this long ago…”</p><p>Lu Zhang couldn't say for sure what this place used to be like.</p><p>Along the way, they passed through several markets.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the further they went into the Southern Province's heartland, the more proficient the Southern Province cultivators became in gu and poison techniques due to the environment, similar to the methods of the Leng Clan’s three heroes.</p><p>They most likely originated from the Southern and Savage Provinces, and this place was very likely the origin of the Gu God Cult.</p><p>Qin Sang voiced this discovery.</p><p>Lu Zhang deeply agreed. “The Gu God Cult developing in the Southern and Savage Provinces indeed wouldn't attract too much attention. After obtaining the treasure, we’ll stay for a few days and investigate the origins of the Gu God Cult.”</p><p>When they reached the border between the Southern and Savage Provinces, it was indeed as Lu Zhang had said; the population became even sparser.</p><p>Lu Zhang held several maps, checking them against each other for a long while before finally confirming a direction.</p><p>They flew among the mountains for more than half an hour.</p><p>When they were nearing their destination, Qin Sang inadvertently glanced at a mortal village below and let out a soft gasp, halting his flight.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang’s actions, Lu Zhang also stopped and followed Qin Sang’s gaze.</p><p>This village was quite large, built at the foot of a mountain by a river. Layers of stilt houses extended all the way up the mountain, almost covering the entire slope.</p><p>The mountaintop was a single giant rock, incredibly flat, a naturally formed stone platform.</p><p>There were no other structures on the stone platform, only a wooden statue placed on the north side and a fire pit dug in the center.</p><p>Night was falling, and the fire pit was piled high with firewood, burning red-hot.</p><p>The wind was strong on the mountaintop, fanning the flames. Tongues of fire shot up several feet high, and sparks were carried into the air by the wind, twinkling like a river of stars, drifting far away.</p><p>Today might be a special festival for the village.</p><p>Everyone in the village, men and women, young and old, were gathered on the stone platform.</p><p>The dew was heavy, and the night was cold.</p><p>Perhaps the chill was dispelled by the fire pit, as these people didn't feel cold at all. They danced a strange dance around the fire pit, emitting rhythmic shouts, as if performing some kind of ritual.</p><p>After a while, everyone knelt down, facing the statue to the north, and let out a unified chant.</p><p>“Vacuum Immortal Land.”</p><p>“Vacuum Immortal Land.”</p><p>…</p><p>Their voices and expressions were filled with fanaticism.</p><p>This was a world where cultivators existed.</p><p>A Qi Refining cultivator could wield power and influence among mortals. If he wished, by casually bestowing a few healing pills or talismans, he could indeed alleviate pain and sickness. Deceiving ignorant mortals was the easiest thing.</p><p>Making mortals worship and adore him, providing for his enjoyment.</p><p>The Middle Province had strict control from various sects, leaving no breeding ground for evil cults.  It was different in remote areas like the Southern and Savage Provinces.</p><p>Similar situations were common among mortals.</p><p>However, what caught Qin Sang's attention was the statue.</p><p>The statue’s craftsmanship was crude, its figure thin and disproportionate. Its face had no features, just a smooth surface, very bizarre.</p><p>The strangest thing was the crown worn on the statue’s head, adorned with five jade pieces.</p><p>These jade pieces were naturally not any good jade, cloudy and rough, but both their shape and color corresponded to the pattern on the back of the Gu God Token.</p><p>“Is this the Gu God Cult?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He hadn’t expected to find traces of the Gu God Cult so easily, much less in an ordinary mortal village.</p><p>If the Gu God Cult only preached among mortals in the Southern and Savage Provinces, it was no wonder that not many people had noticed them.  But what benefit did the Gu God Cult, with its Nascent Soul protectors, gain from deceiving these mortals?</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Gu God Token.</p><p>He hadn’t revealed this matter to Lu Zhang.</p><p>The whereabouts of the Transformation God cultivators in the Middle Province were unknown, and the situation in the cultivation world was uncertain.  After his true body's cultivation was complete, he was fully qualified to establish his own sect and observe the general trend of the world. There was no need to tie himself to the Unwavering Mountain so early.</p><p>There might be opportunities to cooperate with the Gu God Cult in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang made an excuse, pointing at the crown on the statue’s head, telling Lu Zhang that this statue might be related to the Gu God Cult.</p><p>Lu Zhang also didn't understand the Gu God Cult's intentions. He activated his divine sense, sweeping it back and forth across the statue several times. It was indeed just an ordinary wooden sculpture, not a magical treasure, and possessed no special power.</p><p>“Vacuum Immortal Land.”</p><p>“Vacuum Immortal Land.”</p><p>…</p><p>The mortals were still chanting, as if immersed in a fantasy world.  They repeated only this one phrase, but no one chanted the Gu God’s name.</p><p>Until the end of the ritual, an old man, presumably the village chief, lit a stack of yellow talismans and ordered someone to mix them into talisman water for the entire village to consume.</p><p>Then everyone went home satisfied.</p><p>“Not spirit talismans, they have no effect. These people just drank a bellyful of ash water,” Qin Sang said, shaking his head.</p><p>One village couldn’t explain anything.</p><p>The two didn't stay any longer. They flew for a while longer, arriving at a mountaintop.</p><p>The terrain here was extremely treacherous, but very common in the Southern and Savage Provinces.</p><p>Ahead was a rare, flat basin.  Within a radius of ten thousand miles, there wasn’t a single normal plant to be found.  The smell of decay permeated the air, and no life could be felt.</p><p>As night fell, wisps of miasma emerged from unknown sources, already accumulating a thick layer in the basin and rapidly spreading upwards.</p><p>It was imaginable that by late night, this place would be completely sealed off by miasma.</p><p>“This should be the place.”</p><p>Lu Zhang looked ahead.</p><p>In his hand, he held a cyan bead. The bead was jade-green but not transparent, its surface soft, looking like the seed of some kind of flower or plant.</p><p>“Can’t you use this Spirit Illusion Seed to find the Stone Toad?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, looking at the bead.</p><p>The treasure Lu Zhang was looking for was a peculiar creature called a Stone Toad.</p><p>This Stone Toad was born of heaven and earth, said to be transformed from stone, naturally possessing the ability of illusion.</p><p>The Stone Toad constantly absorbed the Purple Qi of Heaven and Earth, gradually maturing, and eventually transforming into a Purple-Striped Spirit Toad. At that time, it would gain sentience and become a true living being.</p><p>The Purple-Striped Spirit Toad could come and go without a trace, and its effects were even better, but it was almost impossible to capture.</p><p>This was also why Lu Zhang was so urgent; he was looking for a nearly mature Stone Toad.</p><p>The process of the Stone Toad absorbing Purple Qi would cause unique phenomena.  If a threat approached, it would scatter spores that disguised themselves as the seeds of a flower called the Spirit Illusion Flower — Spirit Illusion Seeds.</p><p>Their appearance was almost identical, and their function was similar.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators, if unaware, couldn't tell the difference.</p><p>Without refinement, channeling True Essence into them could create illusions, also useful in combat, greatly appealing to low-level cultivators.  Obtaining a Spirit Illusion Seed was like acquiring a treasure, completely unaware that they had missed the true treasure.</p><p>The closer the Stone Toad was to maturity, the more powerful the spores it scattered.</p><p>The one in Lu Zhang's hand could already transform into houses and courtyards, almost the highest level.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator had taken it out to display while sharing rare objects, and Lu Zhang had recognized that it wasn’t a Spirit Illusion Seed but a Stone Toad spore, subtly extracting its origin.</p><p>Lu Zhang shook his head. “Once the Stone Toad scatters its spores and sheds its skin, the connection is completely severed.”</p>
