<h1>Chapter 1296: Treachery</h1><p>“Could it be a trap?”</p><p>Bai was greatly surprised and somewhat incredulous after seeing the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>No wonder Qin Sang called him a lucky general.</p><p>He had only been at the front lines for ten days when a sudden upheaval occurred in Yu City without warning, seemingly caused by internal strife within the Abyss.</p><p>During the successful campaign, when they were about to attack Tianxing City, the Abyss didn't engage in infighting due to disputes over spoils.</p><p>Now, defeat is inevitable, one wrong move could lead to utter ruin.  Internal strife at this point would only benefit the Two Realms Alliance. Is the Abyss really that foolish?</p><p>Who are the warring factions?</p><p>What is the cause?</p><p>Qin Sang was also pondering this question.</p><p>“Daoist Zhenyi is summoning all the Yuan Ying cultivators. He must be fairly certain of this news, it's not baseless.  My senior sister and Jingyu are on their way. We'll know what's happening once we see Daoist Zhenyi.”</p><p>After a stick of incense, two streaks of light sped across the sky above the city—Qingjun and Jingyu.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed their aura and emerged from the stone house.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and others were waiting outside. “Master Uncle, everyone is assembled.”</p><p>A short while ago, Qin Sang had abruptly changed the orders. Everyone was meditating but was awakened and prepared for battle.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around at everyone and said gravely, “Yu Fu, you leave immediately, without delay. Proceed to Caishi City with utmost speed!”</p><p>Caishi City was one of the largest cities on the plains and had already fallen. Daoist Zhenyi was currently in the city.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was startled. “Master Uncle, what happened?”</p><p>“Rest assured, it’s good news!”</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his foot, transforming into a long rainbow that pierced the sky and joined Qingjun and Jingyu.</p><p>The three of them, along with Bai, who was inside the corpse puppet bag, flew to Caishi City without stopping.</p><p>As they arrived at the city gate, several figures flew in from another direction and landed beside them—the Lord of Mysterious Darkness, Lord Dongyang, and others.</p><p>Each with their own thoughts, they exchanged brief nods and hurried into the city, eager to find Daoist Zhenyi and get some answers.</p><p>Inside Caishi City:</p><p>Originally, a cultivator family ruled Caishi City, but they had now evacuated with the Abyss' army.</p><p>This family occupied the most central location in Caishi City.</p><p>Amidst the desolate plains, this place was a picture of vibrant life, with beautiful lakes and mountains, like a Jiangnan oasis in the desert. The scenery was breathtaking and was not inferior to any cultivator sect; it truly had a secluded and hidden charm.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others entered the main hall at the top of the mountain and saw Daoist Zhenyi. They found some figures already present.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists have arrived.”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi rose to greet them, nodding with a smile.</p><p>“We happened to meet outside…” The Lord of Mysterious Darkness strode in, his gaze fixed on Daoist Zhenyi's eyes, cutting straight to the point. “Old Daoist, is the urgent report true or false?”</p><p>The Lord of Mysterious Darkness was also clearly skeptical of the news.</p><p>It was too unbelievable, illogical!</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi smiled, gesturing inside. “Fellow Daoist, please be patient. Several more fellow Daoists are arriving soon.  I will then reveal all the information and we can verify its truth together.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingjun found seats and communicated through secret voice transmission.</p><p>More people arrived successively, and armies from all sides were converging on Caishi City. Soon, the last person arrived, making all the Yuan Ying cultivators at the front line present.</p><p>Then, Daoist Zhenyi cleared his throat, looked around at everyone, and bowed slightly. “I know many of you are doubtful. To be frank, I was shocked when I received the news, fearing it was a conspiracy, a rather poorly devised trap. But I can assure you that the source of the information is very reliable. I can't guarantee it's foolproof, but I'm at least ninety-nine percent certain!”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi's tone was firm and confident.</p><p>Some were swayed by Daoist Zhenyi’s confidence, believing it to be seven or eight parts true. Others remained vigilant, even beginning to suspect Daoist Zhenyi's motives, especially those from the Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>As the situation gradually became clearer, the contradictions within the alliance began to surface again.</p><p>Especially after seeing the abundant resources on the plains, although the various forces of the two domains maintained a harmonious facade, there was inevitably some overt and covert struggle.</p><p>Fortunately, the Two Realms Alliance had anticipated this and had already reached a consensus: all resources would be fairly distributed according to contribution after the war; otherwise, internal strife would have erupted long ago.</p><p>The assembled cultivators exchanged glances, their expressions varied.</p><p>It was common knowledge that the Two Realms Alliance and the Abyss had been constantly fighting for control of the plains, with mutual grievances dating back a long time.</p><p>During this period, mutual infiltration was common.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi must have a deeply hidden and highly trusted intelligence network!</p><p>As everyone was lost in thought, Daoist Zhenyi continued, “While summoning all of you, I received two more pieces of information, even more specific.”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi paused.</p><p>“Firstly, the cause of the chaos in Yu City is the treachery of Elder Ye.”</p><p>Secondly, most of the Zu Yuan's Nascent Soul cultivators were in Yu City.  Completely unprepared, they were slaughtered by Ye Lao Mo alone, resulting in heavy losses!"</p><p>This statement caused an uproar.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Impossible! Has Ye Lao Mo gone mad?"</p><p>"Ye Lao Mo, single-handedly, slaughtered other Nascent Soul cultivators?"</p><p>…</p><p>The hall was filled with old hands who had cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage and weathered countless storms.  They were usually unflappable, rarely showing emotional disturbance.</p><p>Yet, they were all shocked, with a few even gasping in surprise.</p><p>They had expected Daoist Zhen Yi to present irrefutable evidence, but instead heard something far more preposterous.</p><p>"Ye Lao Mo's rebellion? Half of Zu Yuan belonged to him. If he rebels against Zu Yuan, who does he side with? Who is capable enough to persuade him to surrender, and offer him even better benefits?" someone questioned, striking at the core of the matter.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall a familiar phrase—"Why did Your Majesty rebel?"</p><p>Even more unbelievable was Ye Lao Mo's single-handed massacre of Zu Yuan's Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>"Even if those old geezers are weak, they still have the Youjing Tower. Working together, even late-stage Nascent Soul experts couldn't gain the upper hand in Yu City. When did Ye Lao Mo become so terrifyingly powerful?"</p><p>However, Daoist Zhen Yi stated firmly, "It was indeed a massacre. Those killed couldn't even escape with their Nascent Souls, and others were seriously injured! As for the Youjing Tower, it was secretly destroyed by Ye Lao Mo. By the time others realized something was wrong, it was too late."</p><p>"The Youjing Tower was destroyed by Ye Lao Mo…"</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>One explosive piece of news after another.</p><p>The Youjing Tower had a mysterious origin and was one of Zu Yuan's greatest assets.  It was capable of both attack and defense, flexible and adaptable, making it incredibly difficult to deal with. Its appearance on the battlefield had caused the Two Realms Alliance considerable headaches.</p><p>Without the Youjing Tower, the Two Realms Alliance's campaign wouldn't have been so arduous.</p><p>"Regardless of Ye Lao Mo's intentions, what was his ultimate fate? What's the situation in Yu City, and what was the outcome of this internal conflict?"</p><p>Qing Jun rapidly fired off several questions.</p><p>Having heard this news, her expression remained calm.  She kept her head slightly lowered, silent and thoughtful, before finally speaking.</p>
