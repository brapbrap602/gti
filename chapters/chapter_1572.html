<h1></h1><p>The Gu King's poison proved more potent than anticipated, its backlash equally severe.</p><p>The strange-faced man had underestimated this.</p><p>This was understandable. With his cultivation level, few in the world could oppose him. He hadn't expected to be unable to control the insects he had personally nurtured.</p><p>The gray-robed man was still preoccupied with his Master's Gu beasts, his anxious tone barely concealed, "Master, that person stole the Five-Colored Venom Spider. How will you cultivate the Gu King in the future...?"</p><p>"The Gu King is nearing completion. The Five-Colored Venom Spider is no longer essential; it will only take a few more years."</p><p>Glancing at his disciple, the strange-faced man felt a flicker of displeasure. He mused that taking shortcuts in cultivation truly left many hidden dangers.  His disciple’s composure wasn't even as good as a newly Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"I chose the Five-Colored Venom Spider because it's the most suitable Gu beast for nurturing the Gu King. Do you think your Master cannot find one with even greater potential?"</p><p>The gray-robed man was abashed, then suddenly saw his Master toss him something.</p><p>It was a Gu God Token, but its shape and pattern were vastly different from Qin Sang's.</p><p>"That Stone Spirit is secondary. The other person possesses an exceptionally pure Wood Spiritual Qi, rarely seen in this world. He carries a Spirit Treasure and must have a significant background. If he escapes back to his lair, we won't have another opportunity like this. I'll suppress the Gu King first. Take this token to the nearby Wailing Spirit Cave and see the Wailing Spirit Cave Master. Ask him to emerge."</p><p>The strange-faced man's right hand returned to its normal skin tone as his thumb and index finger plunged into the bloody hole in his palm, pulling out the Jade Scarab.</p><p>‘Hiss… ’</p><p>The Jade Scarab was ferocious, immediately turning to bite.</p><p>He shook his left hand. The flesh within the bloody hole had already begun to fester. The poison seeped into his meridians, and a gray aura spread to his wrist. Fortunately, the Gu King was his own creation. By turning his left arm into withered wood, he could still withstand it.</p><p>The strange-faced man sneered, "Having been poisoned by the Gu King, recovery is no easy feat. The Daoist from Mount Bu Nian forcefully channeled his Qi. By now, the poison must have entered his vital organs. If he abandons that fellow, it’s fine. Otherwise, he won't escape far and will certainly leave a trail!"</p><p>With that, the strange-faced man plummeted, disappearing into the earth.</p><p>The gray-robed man put away the Gu God Token, glanced around, and flew back towards the surface.</p><p>…</p><p>At this very moment.</p><p>Within an underground tunnel, an azure light flashed. As it sped along, the azure light faded, becoming increasingly faint until it finally stopped, revealing two figures: Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>Qin Sang’s complexion was normal, completely unharmed.</p><p>Lu Zhang, however, was deathly pale, his lips ashen.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang spoke with a grave tone, "Fellow Daoist Lu, the poison in your body..."</p><p>"I won't die, for now."</p><p>Lu Zhang's face was etched with bitterness. "What a terrifying poison! In just this short time, my blood and Qi are withered, and the True Essence within me has stagnated. I consumed a Purity Preserving Pill to suppress the poison. Now, after forcefully using my True Essence to activate the Contemplation Bell, the poison is surging again. Once it enters my Nascent Soul, even if I project my Nascent Soul, I won't be able to use the Instantaneous Travel technique. I'll truly be trapped with no escape. Such a virulent poison, I've never heard of anything like it."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Purity Preserving Pill. It was said that only Mount Bu Nian could refine it, and it was extremely precious. Yet, it could only suppress the poison.</p><p>As they spoke, the azure light weakened further, until only a tiny, mung bean-sized emerald shimmer remained. It circled Lu Zhang, leaving a faint azure trail.</p><p>Of the massive Contemplation Bell, only a sliver of its origin power remained.</p><p>A pang of heartache flashed across Lu Zhang's eyes. He grasped the emerald shimmer and stored it away somewhere unknown, then began to cough violently, a gray aura appearing between his eyebrows.</p><p>Forcefully using the Contemplation Bell had given the poison within him another opportunity.</p><p>Seeing his precarious state, Qin Sang said in a deep voice, "We're still within the range of the underground miasma, not out of danger. We cannot stay here long. I have a method to move stealthily within the poisonous miasma. If you trust me, Fellow Daoist, you can temporarily seal your meridians."</p><p>"If it weren't for Daoist's efforts to save me, I would have perished. What is there not to trust? I'll trouble you, Daoist."</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded without hesitation. Closing his eyes, he secretly grasped a jade talisman and entered a state of suspended animation, sealing his blood and Qi, isolating himself from the outside world.</p><p>Qin Sang released a chilling light, encasing Lu Zhang in ice, then grabbed the ice block.  Simultaneously, he dispersed his protective True Essence, his figure merging with the miasma and vanishing.</p><p>He traveled for a long time within the miasma.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't sense any pursuers.</p><p>He wasn't sure if it was due to Lu Zhang's remarkable divine ability directly throwing off their enemies, or some other reason.</p><p>In fact, during the fight, Qin Sang had noticed the strange-faced man's unusual behavior. Based on his experience, he could vaguely guess some things. For example, the Jade Scarab’s poison was so terrifying, yet it was only used once and then kept clutched in the strange-faced man's left hand. There had to be a reason.</p><p>With his Spirit Treasure, he might not need to flee.</p><p>But there was no need to take risks. The opponent was, after all, a powerful cultivator. While victory might be possible, the chance of killing him was minuscule. There was no benefit in fighting to the death.</p><p>This was the opponent's territory, and reinforcements could be summoned at any time.</p><p>The range of the underground miasma was far more extensive than he'd imagined.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that he had left the basin, but he was still far from the edge of the miasma.  The number of tunnels had merely decreased somewhat.</p><p>He traveled for a long time, then heard the gurgling of water ahead. He discovered underground rivers, and not just one.</p><p>They were all poisonous rivers.</p><p>The waters of the underground rivers mingled with the poisonous miasma. Qin Sang determined that they posed little threat to him, so he jumped into a river and drifted with the current.</p><p>…</p><p>The gray-robed man flew to the surface, ascertained his bearings, and soared through the air.</p><p>Outside the basin.</p><p>In the vast expanse of poisonous miasma, a mountain range loomed, like a malevolent dragon lying in wait, ready to devour, a chilling sight.</p><p>The gray-robed man flew towards the mountains, not concealing his aura. As he approached, he was detected by a cultivator within the mountains. A voice echoed from afar, "Which Fellow Daoist graces my humble abode?"</p><p>Before the words faded, a figure emerged from the miasma.</p><p>The gray-robed man halted his flight, secretly vigilant. "Are you the Wailing Spirit Cave Master?"</p><p>The newcomer was an elder with white hair and beard. He sized up the gray-robed man and asked doubtfully, "Indeed, I am! Fellow Daoist looks unfamiliar. You haven't cultivated in the Southern Continent before, have you?"</p><p>The gray-robed man didn't reply. With a flick of his wrist, he sent the Gu God Token flying towards the Wailing Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master flicked out a ghostly shadow that caught the Gu God Token in its mouth. Upon seeing the token, his face darkened, and he said with displeasure, "Haven't I made it clear? Unless there's absolute certainty, you're not to drag me into your affairs, much less disturb my cultivation..."</p><p>Mid-sentence, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master's gaze abruptly fixed on the Gu God Token.  His voice was filled with surprise, "Wood Aspect?"</p><p>He abruptly looked up, scrutinizing the gray-robed man. "You're surely not Lord Wood Aspect, are you?"</p><p>"It is my Master."</p><p>The gray-robed man's lips moved, transmitting a message.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master's expression shifted uncertainly, then finally nodded.</p><p>…</p><p>Not long after the battle for the Stone Toad.</p><p>Nearby cultivators discovered that the center of the basin had collapsed, forming a massive, bottomless hole filled with poisonous miasma. A lake of miasma had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>For a period afterward, escape lights occasionally flashed across the sky with astonishing speed. They were all mysterious powerhouses, coming and going like shadows.</p><p>These unusual signs terrified the nearby cultivators, who fled the area. Strange tales began to circulate within the cultivation world.</p><p>It wasn't until several months later that the chaos gradually subsided and normalcy returned. The cultivators resumed their former lives, though the giant hole in the basin would never heal.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had left the Southern Continent.</p><p>He had carried Lu Zhang, drifting along the underground poisonous river, and safely escaped. Upon returning to the surface, they found themselves within the Savage Continent.</p><p>The Savage Continent was vast and sparsely populated.</p><p>Confirming that they had shaken off their pursuers, they found a deserted mountain and opened a cave dwelling to heal.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't injured and quickly recovered after a brief period of meditation. He remained to protect Lu Zhang.</p><p>The restrictive formations shimmered.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He pushed open the door and saw Lu Zhang emerge from the cave.</p><p>Color had returned to Lu Zhang’s face, and his complexion was good. He must have purged the poison from his body.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Lu, on escaping danger."</p><p>Lu Zhang sighed and bowed to Qin Sang.  "Fortunately, I had the foresight to invite Fellow Daoist to accompany me. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable."</p><p>If it weren't for Qin Sang holding back the strange-faced man and creating an opportunity, even if he had escaped into the Azure Bell, he would have only become a turtle in its shell, eventually to be broken out.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, not taking credit. "Our escape from that fiend's clutches is thanks to Fellow Daoist's Contemplation Bell. It truly is a remarkable treasure, possessing multiple powerful abilities, each quite exceptional."</p><p>"The Contemplation Bell was developed by generations of our ancestors. It's a treasure perfectly suited to our sect's divine abilities. Those two divine abilities cause irreversible damage to it, using the treasure's origin power as a price. It is our sect's final life-saving measure."</p><p>Lu Zhang explained.</p><p>Recalling the destroyed Contemplation Bell, Lu Zhang's eyes dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang consoled him, "Fortunately, its origin hasn't been extinguished. With Mount Bu Nian's resources, supporting Fellow Daoist in re-refining the Contemplation Bell shouldn't be difficult.  Compared to that, obtaining the Stone Toad is more cause for celebration, enough to offset the loss."</p><p>Lu Zhang's expression brightened slightly upon hearing this.</p><p>He naturally understood that Qin Sang was deliberately changing the subject.  He tactfully avoided mentioning the Spirit Treasure and instead inquired about Qin Sang's impression of the strange-faced man.</p><p>"The strange-faced man had a peculiar appearance and mastered Wood divine abilities to an astonishing degree.  Does Fellow Daoist Lu have no impression of this person?" Qin Sang countered.</p><p>In the Central Continent, even Grand Cultivators were rare.</p><p>The path of cultivation was defined by a single word: 'strife'.  There were no airtight walls in the world. As long as one ventured out to compete for opportunities, news would inevitably spread and become known.</p><p>Those who reached such a realm, which one of them hadn't accumulated various opportunities?</p><p>Even Buddhist masters couldn't completely isolate themselves from the world, living only with ancient scriptures and Buddha statues.</p><p>Qin Sang emphasized the strange-faced man's Wood divine abilities rather than the Jade Scarab.</p><p>It was clear that the Jade Scarab was an external object, while the Wood Dao was the strange-faced man's fundamental path.</p><p>Lu Zhang pondered for a long time.  "The Wood Dao is one of the Five Elemental Daos, and there are quite a few Fellow Daoists who specialize in it. The cultivators of the Southern and Savage Continents have always been known for their secrecy. If this person recently advanced to the late stage and has been hiding here cultivating that Jade Scarab, his reputation may not have spread yet.  After returning to the mountain, I'll have my Senior Martial Brother, the Sect Master, keep an eye out for this person.  He acts ruthlessly.  With that venomous creature refined, who knows how many Fellow Daoists will suffer at his hands in the future."</p><p>Once the Jade Scarab reached maturity, any cultivator lacking methods to ward off or detoxify its poison would face certain death if they were unlucky enough to be struck.</p><p>Qin Sang was also deeply wary of the strange-faced man.</p><p>Having targeted his avatar, the man might not give up easily.  His avatar would need to be constantly vigilant in the future.</p><p>…</p><p>After recovering, the two decided to leave this place of strife and return to Zhuo Continent.</p><p>They detoured through the western part of the Savage Continent, deliberately slowing their pace to observe the local customs.</p><p>They soon made a discovery: the Gu God Cult had a significant presence among the mortals of the Savage Continent, having spread its influence in secret for an unknown period.</p><p>The Gu God Cult only proselytized among mortals, deceiving them with hallucinogenic drugs. The cultivators of the Savage Continent found this commonplace and dismissive, causing no ripples within the cultivation world.</p><p>If not for knowing that the Gu God Cult had Nascent Soul cultivators as protectors, Qin Sang wouldn't have paid it any mind.</p><p>If the Gu God Cult stepped out from behind the scenes, would earth-shattering changes occur? Qin Sang decided to remain uninvolved, letting the major sects worry about it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, one night, as they passed over a village, a phrase they overheard caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The mortals of the Southern and Savage Continents lived in similar environments, and the villages' locations and structures were largely identical.</p><p>That night, the village below was also worshipping a statue.</p><p>The villagers had consumed potent hallucinogenic drugs, and the scene was even more chaotic than the first village they'd encountered, a veritable pandemonium.</p><p>After the drug's effects wore off, the nearly ninety-year-old village chief led the villagers to kneel before the statue, chanting something that seemed to be a kind of scripture.</p><p>This scripture pointed to the location of the True Void Immortal Paradise, speaking of a deity's compassion for humanity, bringing the Immortal Palace down to the mortal realm to guide believers.  Only those with utmost faith and sincerity could qualify to escape all suffering, achieving immortality and eternal bliss.</p><p>The True Void Immortal Paradise was filled with countless Immortal Halls, stretching endlessly, located above the South Sea!</p><p>Qin Sang was most sensitive to the words 'Immortal Halls'.  Upon hearing them, he immediately stopped.</p><p>If it were any other邪教(evil cult), it could be dismissed as nonsense. But the Gu God Cult had Nascent Soul protectors, and their scriptures might hold hidden truths, not entirely fabricated.</p><p>The scriptures described the South Sea Immortal Halls in incredibly beautiful terms, overflowing with praise.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experiences in the Violet Firmament Palace and the Seven Kills Hall, nothing he'd seen matched this description.</p><p>However, different Immortal Halls might have different environments.  Moreover, these scriptures were meant to deceive mortals, so embellishment and exaggeration were inevitable.</p><p>Connecting a mortal cult to the mysterious Immortal Halls.</p><p>It sounded completely absurd.</p><p>But Qin Sang had been investigating the cultivation world for years with no progress. This was the first seemingly plausible clue he'd encountered, and he couldn't ignore it.</p><p>He glanced at Lu Zhang beside him.  Lu Zhang showed no reaction upon hearing about the South Sea Immortal Halls.</p><p>It was unclear what had happened in the Central Continent and why the Celestial Harmony Hall and Celestial Aspect Hall were so deeply hidden.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be too obvious. After listening to the entire scripture, he continued north with Lu Zhang, but he had already taken note of the Gu God Cult.</p><p>The Southern and Savage Continents were not peaceful lands, and the Gu God Cult was诡异莫测(unpredictable and strange). To be safe, he would wait until his true body reached a higher cultivation level before investigating personally.</p><p>…</p><p>Besides the Fu River, the Central Plains had another great river: the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>It flowed from north to south, originating in the Northern Wastelands, passing through Zhao Yao Continent and the eastern part of Zhuo Continent.  After converging with the Fu River in the Six Continents East of the River, it branched out, flowing through the Southern and Savage Continents and finally emptying into the South Sea, traversing the entire Central Plains.</p><p>After leaving the Savage Continent, the two boarded a ship on the Flying Cloud River, traveling upstream directly to Zhuo Continent.</p><p>Mount Bu Nian's sect grounds were located on the west bank of the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>After disembarking.</p><p>Lu Zhang invited Qin Sang to Mount Bu Nian, but Qin Sang was eager to return to Pu Mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't insist, saying earnestly, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist.  After returning, I'll request the Cold Crystals from my Senior Martial Brother, the Sect Master, and have them sent to your residence..."</p>
