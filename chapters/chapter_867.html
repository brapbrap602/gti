<h1>Chapter 859: The Rain-Swept Wasteland</h1><p>A young man surnamed Fang invited five others.  When hunting demonic beasts, Qin Sang and the others would operate the Heavenly Cold Gale Array.</p><p>"There was a slight mishap with the last ice stele; it'll be ready tomorrow.  Daoist Qin, please observe Daoist Qiu and the others practicing the array. We'll set off immediately after I refine the stele,"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang explained, then soared into the air above the icy pool, taking out a fragmented crystal stele to absorb the cold energy and refine it.</p><p>Qin Sang greeted the others and found a spot by the icy pool to meditate.</p><p>The large man surnamed Qiu, whose real name was Qiu Ji, instructed the others in the array practice.  To allow Qin Sang to clearly see every change and keep up, they deliberately slowed their pace.</p><p>Another cultivator Qin Sang recognized was named Chu Heng.</p><p>The other two were named Luo Kun and Ma Debao.</p><p>They were once independent cultivators, but had been recruited as retainers by sects near Tianxing Island. To avoid too many restrictions, they hadn't joined any major forces.</p><p>Chu Heng excelled in arrays and prohibitions. He controlled the eye of the Heavenly Cold Gale Array and led the others in practice.</p><p>Luo Kun was taciturn; a slight nod to Qin Sang was his greeting.</p><p>The cultivator named Ma Debao wasn't very appealing; his small eyes were set in a broad face, his pupils darting around. When he looked at Qin Sang, it was as if he were blatantly spying on his secrets.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, all five were mid-stage Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>While observing the array's changes, Qin Sang's gaze fell unintentionally on the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>Earlier, when entering the cave with the young man, Qin Sang cautiously awakened his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to prevent any treachery and detect any hidden restrictions.</p><p>He didn't find any ambushes, but unexpectedly discovered something unusual about the young man.</p><p>Normally, Qin Sang wouldn't use the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities to spy on others; Core Formation cultivators have keen spiritual senses, and being discovered could create enemies.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly didn't directly probe the young man's secrets, so it wasn't detected. Yet, the young man seemed enveloped in a fog, impenetrable even to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities had been repeatedly proven, capable of seeing through illusions and disguises.</p><p>During the breakout from Yu Heng Island, a late-stage demonic core beast that had consumed Emperor's Flowing Liquid attempted to ambush him, but was detected by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Similarly, the Xi You Alliance cultivators were defeated recently due to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang must possess some treasure or ability that concealed him, resisting scrutiny and rendering the Sky-Eyed Butterfly useless.</p><p>Qiu Ji and the others practiced the array at increasing speed.</p><p>After observing once, Qin Sang's expression was serious; he had no time for other thoughts. The Heavenly Cold Gale Array was more complex than he expected, and with the ice steles incomplete, only parts of the array could be activated.</p><p>For the five of them to fully grasp the array and use it against a late-stage demonic core beast, they'd likely need to practice continuously on their way to the beast's lair.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless, meticulously recording every change.  Unknowingly, a day passed.</p><p>The next day at noon, the young man surnamed Fang finally refined the ice stele. After a brief discussion, they decided to depart immediately.</p><p>To save time, they didn't take a boat.  The young man produced a flying artifact, and they took turns piloting it while others practiced the array.</p><p>After leaving the island, the young man steered the artifact directly north; its light streaked across the sea like a meteor.</p><p>"Daoist Fang, you've kept this so secret, unwilling to reveal any information.  Could the demonic beast's lair be in the Rain-Swept Wasteland of the North Sea?"</p><p>Ma Debao stroked his beard and asked in a sharp voice.</p><p>The young man lifted his eyelids, smiling slightly. "Daoist Ma is overthinking.  The journey from Tianxing Island to the Rain-Swept Wasteland of the North Sea is years long; you'd all be impatient halfway there.  Our destination is on the edge of the North Sea, only two months away.  You'll know what beast it is when we reach its lair."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly; if the journey took too long, he'd have to reconsider.</p><p>The Rain-Swept Wasteland, mentioned by the two, was a peculiar area in the depths of the North Sea, near the storm zone.</p><p>Some attempted to divide the inner sea into four quadrants, but its shape isn't regular, roughly a long and narrow rectangle running north-south.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang sought out the senior Qingzhu, traveling to the Riftwind Islands in the southwest sea. Had he not returned, but continued westward, he would have soon reached the storm belt on the western side of the Inner Sea.</p><p>However, traveling north would have taken much longer, first reaching a region of constant torrential rain known as the Rain Desert.</p><p>It is said that the North Sea is the area most affected by the storm belt, especially the Rain Desert, where relentless rain obscures the sun.  Ordinary mortals could not survive there.</p><p>Therefore, aside from islands with spirit veins where cultivators might be found, the rest are barren. This area is less chaotic than the Riftwind Islands, but undoubtedly the most desolate and lonely region of the Inner Sea.</p><p>Qiu Ji exclaimed, "Even in the Inner Sea, outside the Rain Desert, this great demon hasn't been hunted by powerful cultivators?"</p><p>"The beast thrives, quite wantonly."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang nodded. "The reason I discovered this beast is that a friend's trading caravan was attacked. Not only was all their cargo destroyed, but my friend nearly lost his life. He barely escaped, but was severely injured, his cultivation base ruined, leaving him essentially incapacitated.  I hunt this beast to avenge my friend."</p><p>"Daoist Fang, your righteousness…"</p><p>The magical light sped along, and silence returned to the treasure as Qin Sang and the others diligently practiced their formations.  The young man surnamed Fang piloted the treasure, his gaze flickering across the monotonous sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after their departure, several indistinct figures appeared at the edge of the island.</p><p>Their attire was peculiar—all wore black robes, as if shunning the light—except for one, the shopkeeper from Tianxing City.</p><p>His expression towards these figures was cautious and ingratiating.</p><p>"The senior brother has already left with his people; we should also depart. Junior brother, after we leave, you will maintain contact with those late-stage cultivators.  You must keep them steady, lest we lack manpower when needed.  We don't need these people for now, but the senior brother said his information might not be accurate, and there might be further complications."</p><p>One of the robed figures turned to the shopkeeper, his voice recognizable as the man who had traded with Qin Sang in Tianxing City.</p><p>The shopkeeper hastily nodded.  "Senior brother, rest assured, I will do my utmost."</p>
