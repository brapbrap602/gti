<h1>Chapter 1789: Observations within the Healing Platform</h1><p>When Qin Sang and the three others arrived, they saw the ruins of a vast expanse of collapsed golden halls.  The dust had yet to settle, and judging by the remaining traces, a grand formation had once stood here, only to be forcefully breached.  It was unknown what method the Yao Hou had used to break the formation; there hadn't been the slightest ripple beforehand, yet it was shattered in an instant.  One must know that over countless years, most of the golden halls had been explored.  Those remaining were either extremely well-hidden or beyond the capabilities of ordinary cultivators to penetrate.</p><p>The four swiftly swept their divine senses across the ruins, finding only broken bricks and shattered tiles.  The treasures within had been completely plundered by the Yao Hou.</p><p>"What was that golden light that flew out first? Could it be the supreme treasure enshrined within this golden hall?"  Youhuang Zhenren inquired, her voice filled with suspicion as she surveyed the surroundings.</p><p>Due to the severe damage to the ruins, it was impossible to discern their original purpose, making it difficult to determine the origin of the golden light.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and the others believed Youhuang Zhenren's speculation might be accurate.  The golden light was likely the Yao Hou's target; otherwise, they wouldn't have pursued it into the Nine-Bend Star River.</p><p>Able to escape from the encirclement of demons, the golden light was highly likely a spiritual treasure of exceptional sentience, perhaps even having birthed a tool spirit!  At the very least, it was related to the secrets deep within the Healing Platform of Jushan.</p><p>They hadn't seen the treasure yet and wouldn't develop avarice for something unseen.  However, the current situation was undoubtedly advantageous.</p><p>"Those Yao Hou have varying speeds.  Chasing the golden light into the Star River, where danger lurks at every turn, they will certainly be forced to scatter. This is a good opportunity," Guyun Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>Everyone looked up at the Nine-Bend Star River.</p><p>Neither the Yao Hou nor the golden light was visible. The spectacle of myriad lights within the Star River was fading from its peak.</p><p>To seize the opportunity amidst the chaos, they also needed to pursue deeper into the Healing Platform of Jushan, inevitably taking on a certain degree of risk.</p><p>The two Zhenren looked towards Zhijian Zhenren, the initiator of this expedition.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. With the Tianmu Butterfly's advancement, regardless of the power of its new divine abilities, its innate Tianmu divine ability was bound to have greatly improved.  The more complex the situation and formations, the more useful she would be.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly's warnings could help them avoid most dangers.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren looked over, his eyes questioning Qin Sang's opinion. Qin Sang nodded slightly, agreeing with Guyun Zhenren's proposal.</p><p>The four then sped towards the Nine-Bend Star River.  As they approached, they sensed two auras rapidly converging – Zhang Zhenren and Zhenru Venerable.</p><p>The six gathered at the riverbank.</p><p>Only upon closer inspection did they realize that real river water flowed within the Star River, yet it flowed upwards from low to high, culminating in a waterfall whose current ascended to the heavens.</p><p>The specks of starlight resembled fish within the Star River. When the Tianmu Butterfly activated its Tianmu divine ability to penetrate the water, it saw only nothingness.</p><p>However, cultivators who had entered the Nine-Bend Star River knew that danger lurked within the starlight.  One must traverse it swiftly and not allow it to approach.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren spoke of this matter with a serious expression, and Qin Sang took heed.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The group leaped into the Star River, stirring up waves.  The sound of real water echoed in their ears.</p><p>A chill emanated from the river water.  They immediately saw points of light drifting towards them, initially just a few nearby, but quickly alarming those all around.  The dense mass of light specks resembled impatient, man-eating fish. Even with their considerable cultivation, a chill ran down their spines.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Lotus Blossom Seal, his steps landing on blossoming lotuses as he gracefully dodged the approaching light specks, appearing quite at ease.</p><p>This was merely a facade. When Qin Sang reached the other side of the Nine-Bend Star River and glanced back, he felt a wave of relief.</p><p>Behind him, the light specks swarmed, and he didn't wish to experience firsthand what consequences being surrounded by them might bring.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren and Zhijian Zhenren were ahead, having stepped out of the Nine-Bend Star River first. When Qin Sang emerged, he saw them standing on the bank, conversing. Then, Zhang Zhenren raised a hand and lightly tapped the void, a snow-white talisman shooting from his fingertip.</p><p>Qin Sang landed behind the two, observing what lay ahead.</p><p>Having crossed to this side of the Nine-Bend Star River meant entering the heart of the chaotic space.  Not far to their right was the inverted sword peak.</p><p>The peak was incredibly steep, its crevices devoid of even a single blade of grass.  The rock was black as ink, seemingly absorbing the surrounding light.  Space itself appeared distorted, shrouded in mystery.</p><p>Above them was the edge of the suspended mass of vines.  Long vines dangled down like pythons, ready to drag anyone who approached into their cage.</p><p>Directly ahead was a gigantic funnel, thousands of zhang in diameter, perpetually rotating. White light emanated from within, pulled into threads by the swirling force.  A strange space seemed to exist inside the funnel, with glimpses of what resembled pavilions and towers visible through the distorted light.</p><p>It simply spun silently, surrounded by auspicious clouds, exerting no outward pull.  However, all who saw it knew it must be incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Such sights, defying common sense, were invisible from the outside, yet commonplace here.</p><p>Auspicious clouds filled the spaces between these chaotic scenes, forming paths that connected into a vast network, leading in all directions.</p><p>Following these cloud paths was the safest way to travel here. Reaching the end of a path didn't mean there was no further way; it merely meant the path was blocked by ancient ruins.  With sufficient ability, one could continue onward.</p><p>"This Jade Dust Wild Goose Shadow Talisman of mine can capture a wisp of an opponent's aura even in places where qi is chaotic. It's a superior tracking talisman, though it's most effective when used immediately after the target passes..."</p><p>Zhang Zhenren quickly explained, then flicked his finger, sending the talisman shooting out.  Mid-flight, it burst apart.</p><p>The others, who had also prepared tracking techniques, stopped upon seeing this, knowing their methods were inferior to the Jade Dust Wild Goose Shadow Talisman.</p><p>After exploding, the talisman transformed into snowflakes that scattered, a sudden blizzard quickly spreading across the riverbank.</p><p>In the next instant, a white goose emerged from the snow, its entire body pristine white, majestic and divine.  It turned its head from side to side, then powerfully flapped its wings, flying towards one of the cloud paths.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren, who had been activating the talisman with his eyes slightly closed, suddenly opened them and pointed in the direction the goose had flown. "The demons have all gone that way!"</p><p>Everyone used their escape techniques, quickly following.</p><p>The cloud paths were incredibly complex. The group followed closely behind the white goose, weaving through a series of magnificent and wondrous sights.</p><p>Witnessing these rare spectacles, Qin Sang felt his horizons broaden.</p><p>Two sights, in particular, left a deep impression, both remnants of ancient divine abilities.</p><p>One was a gigantic stone fist, seemingly carved from rock, existing alone in the void.  Even now, one could sense the terrifying fist intent contained within, its unleashed power unimaginable.</p><p>The other was a small, azure halo.  Yet, even before approaching, Qin Sang felt his heart tremble, as if the halo represented something utterly terrifying.</p><p>One could only imagine the might of the ancient powerhouses of yore.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren was right. A journey here was enough to reveal one's insignificance and inspire self-improvement.</p><p>As the white goose continued to fly, they remained vigilant, yet they hadn't even glimpsed a Yao Hou.</p><p>Then, the white goose ahead suddenly stopped, circling in place, refusing to move forward. There were clearly no demons nearby, and the talisman's power hadn't been exhausted yet.</p><p>"Hmm? They might have entered..."</p><p>Zhang Zhenren landed beside the white goose, sensed briefly, then turned to look towards the left side of the cloud path.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren also summoned a jade sword, sensed for a moment, and nodded in agreement with Zhang Zhenren's judgment.</p><p>*Pitter-patter...*</p><p>To their left was a curtain of rain.</p><p>The rain poured down, obscuring visibility within its dim depths.</p><p>Strangely, the raindrops weren't clear water, but muddy, yellow earth, splashing mud upon impact with the ground, a filthy scene.</p><p>For the moment, no danger was apparent behind the curtain of rain, but no one dared to lower their guard.</p><p>"While the talisman's power remains, let's pass through here! Everyone, be careful."</p><p>Zhang Zhenren cautioned, then stepped into the rain first. The others exchanged glances and followed suit.</p><p>Being in a larger group lessened their apprehension. Otherwise, they would have considered whether to continue pursuit or lie in wait here.</p><p>*Slap! Slap! Slap!*</p><p>Raindrops pelted their bodies.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his blood and qi, activating his protective罡勁 (gang jin - protective energy), preventing the rain from reaching him.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously for a while, finding nothing unusual, and couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's ears twitched. He heard an unusual splashing sound. The others also heard it and looked over in unison.</p><p>A single raindrop landed, not merging with the mud, but instead sprouting limbs and a head as it distorted and rapidly expanded. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a ten-foot-tall mud figure, resembling a mud golem. Its faceless form faced them, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>"Bean Soldiers!"</p><p>Guyun Zhenren exclaimed.</p><p>This sight was extremely similar to the legendary great divine ability of the Daoists.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the mud figure's strength.  Clearly a lifeless being formed from muddy water, it radiated an aura like that of a living creature, equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Mud splashed as the mud figure transformed into a gray shadow, lunging at Youhuang Zhenren, who was closest.</p><p>The mud figure raised its arms in an embracing posture, seemingly intending to hold her tightly.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren snorted softly, her jade-like finger flicking out a flower seed that embedded itself in the mud figure's chest.</p><p>Immediately, the seed sprouted and took root, its stems and vines rapidly covering the mud figure's entire body, a vibrant, spiritual flower blooming from its crown.</p><p>Shortly after, the flower withered, and the mud figure froze in place, its body covered in cracks like parched earth, before shattering and merging back into the mud.</p><p>The spiritual flower, itself a manifestation of Daoist magic, also vanished.</p><p>This mud figure was only the beginning.  The group then heard that same splashing sound repeatedly, a dozen more mud figures rising around them.</p><p>However, having witnessed Youhuang Zhenren destroy the mud figure, they felt somewhat reassured. It seemed the mud figures possessed no unusual abilities.</p><p>Without needing reminders, everyone accelerated their pace, unleashing their respective magical treasures and divine abilities, charging outwards.</p><p>The rain poured down, and the mud figures seemed endless.</p><p>Faced with the siege of mud figures, the group mostly employed swift and decisive methods to eliminate them quickly.</p><p>The scene around Qin Sang was particularly peculiar.</p><p>Whenever a mud figure approached, it would be pulled by a strange force, struggling briefly before beginning to revolve around him. Despite being mere inches away, they couldn't harm him in the slightest.</p><p>Gradually, more and more mud figures gathered around Qin Sang. With a gentle tremor of his arm, a resounding explosion echoed as all the mud figures simultaneously detonated, scattering into mud specks.</p><p>Looking at the empty space around him, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.  His days of comprehending these two Buddhist seals had finally borne fruit.</p><p>He had managed to merge the Demon Subduing Seal and the Rotating Platform Seal, combining force and gentleness, and the results were truly remarkable.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang was preparing to press on when his heart stirred, sensing a gaze upon him. Looking up, he saw Zhenru Venerable.</p><p>Zhenru Venerable wielded a staff, each flash of its shadow obliterating a mud figure.</p><p>Their gazes met, and Zhenru Venerable didn't flinch, offering Qin Sang a kind smile.  With a flick of his wrist, two *crack* sounds rang out as two approaching mud figures were flung away.</p><p>Then, Zhenru Venerable planted his staff on the ground, brought his arms together, and pressed his palms together before his chest, bowing remotely to Qin Sang.</p><p>Since their encounter, Qin Sang hadn't spoken with Zhenru Venerable, but he'd noticed the Venerable glancing at him intentionally or otherwise.</p><p>It must be due to the *Seven Teachers' Buddhist Seals*.</p><p>The Buddhist principles embedded within the seals couldn't be concealed from Zhenru Venerable's discerning eyes as Qin Sang continued his attempts.</p><p>In this world where the Daoist sect reigned supreme, Buddhist inheritances were few and far between.  It was no wonder Zhenru Venerable paid attention to him.</p><p>"Daoist friend, your divine ability is remarkable!" Zhenru Venerable praised.</p><p>"You flatter me!  Venerable, you overestimate me."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, accepting Zhenru Venerable's invitation to visit Mirror Terrace Temple.</p><p>...</p><p>More mud figures attacked, and after their brief exchange, the two continued to battle them.</p><p>The further they went, the stronger the mud figures became, though thankfully they hadn't encountered any at the Deity Transformation realm.</p><p>Working together, they finally broke through the siege, crossing the rain-soaked area and arriving on the other side. The white goose's guidance became clear once more, and it flew onward.</p><p>They continued for a while longer.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren, seemingly noticing something, suddenly stopped, calling out to the others and pointing to their right.  "I remember that sea of light. Last time we reached that point, we sensed danger and retreated."</p><p>Everyone focused their gaze, seeing a few patches of blue light in the distance amidst the layers of fantastical scenery. The vast expanse of the blue sea of light was evident, though most of it was obscured.</p><p>Although the sea of light was to their right, not directly ahead, the further they progressed here, the greater the danger. Along the same line, the level of peril wouldn't differ greatly.</p><p>If they continued their pursuit, it wouldn't be long before they'd have to be wary of the Healing Platform's inherent threats. Yet, they still hadn't seen any Yao Hou, and doubts lingered in everyone's minds.</p><p>They had come to hunt Yao, not for some grand opportunity they couldn't afford to miss. No one wanted a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>Sensing everyone's apprehension, Zhang Zhenren pondered, "I noticed a stone platform on our way here. There were no strange fluctuations on it, very peaceful. How about we set up a grand formation there first?  If anything unexpected happens, we can escape back to this location and use the formation to obstruct the enemy."</p><p>The others exchanged glances, finding this plan feasible. They immediately turned back, quickly locating the stone platform.</p><p>The platform was remarkably flat. After a brief investigation, they found no dangers and discussed the type of formation to deploy, working together to set it up.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren retrieved a formation disk studded with talisman swords, and Zhang Zhenren assisted him in placing it on the stone platform.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three remained on the cloud path, drawing a specific sword talisman in the air according to Zhijian Zhenren's instructions.</p><p>As the talisman images took shape, they continuously flew towards the stone platform, merging into the formation disk.  The talisman swords on the disk grew increasingly brighter, a faint sword hum resonating.</p><p>Working together, the formation was quickly more than halfway complete.</p><p>Just then, Zhang Zhenren abruptly turned towards the depths, listened for a moment, and his expression drastically changed.  He shouted, "Not good!"</p><p>Everyone looked over in alarm, seeing a blinding golden light erupt from the depths, incredibly dazzling. The halo formed by the golden light instantly engulfed one illusionary scene after another, sweeping across all directions.</p><p>Space itself trembled!</p>
