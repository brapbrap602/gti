<h1>Chapter 1796: The Path to Ascension</h1><p>“Does the Gateway of Gui Xu ultimately lead to this realm? Why are there no traces left by the ascended predecessors here?”</p><p>Confirming the other party's identity, Qin Sang directly asked the biggest question in his heart.</p><p>Mo Xingdao seemed to be observing Qin Sang's expression. After a moment's hesitation, he asked back, “Did Daoist Friend Qin not ascend through Gui Xu?”</p><p>In the Storm World, without the strength of the Nascent Soul stage, it's difficult even to reach Gui Xu, let alone pass the Ascension Path.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, having heard Wan Zhenren's assessment, knew that Qin Sang practiced both body and spirit cultivation. Based on his performance at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, he could also guess that Qi cultivation was his foundation.</p><p>Simply breaking through in body refinement, without reaching the required realm, one would not be able to sense the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>A Nascent Soul stage physical body does indeed have the strength to traverse Gui Xu. But logically speaking, unless Qin Sang knew his time was short, he would certainly wait until his cultivation reached the Nascent Soul stage, ensuring no mistakes, before entering Gui Xu.</p><p>Could it be that he advanced to Nascent Soul in the Storm World?</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Mo Xingdao's thoughts and calmly said, “Daoist Friend needn't probe. I already know about the Heavenly Demon Sound. However, I did not enter Gui Xu.  As you may know, the Storm World isn't the only path to ascension from Gui Xu; there is also the Ascension Platform!”</p><p>“Ascension Platform?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao's tone showed surprise for the first time.</p><p>“That's right,” Qin Sang nodded. “I actually originate from the North Sea, and traveled across the ocean to the Central Plains. During my cultivation in the North Sea, I witnessed someone activating the Ascension Platform and ascending to the upper realm…”</p><p>Qin Sang did not hide anything, describing the beginning of the Xiaohan Domain Uprising and the ascension of his senior sister and others.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent throughout Qin Sang's account.</p><p>Having finished speaking, Qin Sang shook his head slightly and sighed, “My cultivation has been perfected, and upon revealing this matter, wishing to combine the strengths of various sects to find the Ascension Platform, Master Xingji revealed the truth. If those three Daoist friends had waited a few more years, or informed the world of the Heavenly Demon Sound tribulation, why would things have come to this!”</p><p>He already knew that the Hui Guang Saint and Qing Hu Saint had given Mo Xingdao two choices back then.</p><p>Either become a soul-infused puppet, risking being backlashed by the puppet.</p><p>Or forcibly undergo the tribulation; if failing, his true self would be forced into the puppet, controlled by the two Nascent Soul cultivators, but only for a limited time.</p><p>Mo Xingdao must have chosen the former.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the stiff face on the stone, unable to discern any change in expression, unsure of Mo Xingdao's current thoughts.</p><p>After a long silence, Mo Xingdao sighed softly, “So, Daoist Friend found the Ascension Platform, successfully activated it, and ascended to this realm?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>“When was the day of activation?” Mo Xingdao's tone suddenly quickened, questioning repeatedly.</p><p>Upon hearing the time Qin Sang stated, Mo Xingdao chuckled wryly, “As expected! We must have arrived in this realm on the same day.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, immediately realizing something, and asked in a serious tone, “Did you encounter and hunt beasts in the Storm Belt and Gui Xu?”</p><p>“We did not hunt, but we encountered them many times. In the Storm Belt, we were chased by two strange fish; after entering Gui Xu, beasts roamed everywhere, countless in number.  We only managed to repeatedly escape danger by using the Great Five Elements Prohibition Light of the Five Elements Crown to restrain them…”</p><p>Years later, Mo Xingdao still vividly remembered his past experiences, demonstrating just how perilous his time inside Gui Xu was.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange look flashed across Qin Sang's eyes, “You weren't pursued by the Blood Moon?”</p><p>“What Blood Moon?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao was puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others set off earlier, also clashed with beasts in the Storm Belt, and fought continuously after entering Gui Xu, yet they weren't pursued by the Blood Moon.</p><p>The Blood Moon, however, had specifically targeted him, guarding outside the Canglang Sea barrier, even daring to enter the spatial storm to pursue him. What could be the reason?</p><p>What kind of deep-seated hatred could there be between them?</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had suspected that the Blood Moon might be a powerful demon, intending to devour the realm, using the demon sound to cut off the path of Nascent Soul cultivation for the cultivators of this realm, and pursuing anyone attempting to escape their cage. And he had exposed his presence and whereabouts when fighting the Thunder Tortoise, thus attracting pursuit.</p><p>Only after learning about Mo Xingdao's experiences did he realize it wasn't that simple.</p><p>Or perhaps the Blood Moon was the king among the beasts of Gui Xu, and the Thunder Tortoise's death at his hands had enraged this demon?</p><p>Unable to find an answer, Qin Sang temporarily put aside these questions and asked a crucial question, “Didn't you ascend to this realm by passing through the Gateway?”</p><p>From Mo Xingdao's previous answers and tone, Qin Sang already had a guess.</p><p>Mo Xingdao did not conceal anything, directly recounting their experiences inside Gui Xu.</p><p>Originally, Mo Xingdao and two powerful cultivators were swept away eastward, traversing a storm zone before narrowly entering the Guixu.</p><p>They soon discovered that Guixu was far more dangerous than ancient texts described. Following ancestral records, they searched for the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, encountering numerous perils.</p><p>Fortunately, the ferocious beasts were also affected by the Heavenly Demon's sound, driven mad and fighting amongst themselves, preventing a full-scale assault.</p><p>After many hardships, they ventured deep into Guixu, finally locating Daiyu Immortal Mountain.  There, they found inscriptions and writings left by their predecessors, detailing their experiences.</p><p>Between Daiyu Immortal Mountain and the Dao Marker Gate lay a perilous stretch, even more dangerous than the upper reaches of Guixu – known as the Ascension Path.</p><p>The Ascension Path wasn't static; Guixu's instability caused it to change over time.</p><p>Generations of ascension seekers, leaving their experiences recorded on Daiyu Immortal Mountain for future reference, ensured the path’s continued existence.</p><p>"We obtained our ancestors' writings from Daiyu Immortal Mountain, made adjustments, and entered the Ascension Path. But the beasts, maddened by the Heavenly Demon’s sound, wreaked havoc, altering the path significantly from the records.  We had to blaze much of our own trail.  Daiyu Immortal Mountain served as a resting place, allowing us some progress.  However, nearing the Dao Marker Gate, Guixu suddenly convulsed, catching us off guard. A colossal force flung us out…"</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression was complex, his eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Ascension Platform on the same day as the Guixu upheaval.</p><p>Such coincidence, being sent to the same world, strongly implied Qin Sang's involvement.</p><p>Mo Xingdao wasn't sure whether to thank or curse Qin Sang.</p><p>Without that incident, they would have reached the Dao Marker Gate and ascended normally, avoiding the near-death experience that landed them in this strange Daoist world.</p><p>However, their situation was dire.</p><p>Opening the Ascension Path required the Five Elements Crown, constantly activating its power. They had to simultaneously fight the chaotic Guixu, the Heavenly Demon’s sound, and demonic spirit attacks – an immense pressure.</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain offered only relative safety, a temporary place for rest and recuperation. Their strength steadily declined.</p><p>Perhaps without that incident, they would have perished in Guixu, never reaching the Dao Marker Gate.</p><p>“What happened when you activated the Ascension Platform, Qin Daoist friend? What was the Blood Moon?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao understood Qin Sang's ascension hadn't been smooth either.</p><p>“During my ascension, a Blood Moon appeared, transforming into a crimson rainbow that pursued me into a spatial storm, derailing my ascension. What did you encounter after entering the spatial fissure, and how did you arrive in this realm? Where are the Hui Guang Saint and the Qing Hu Saint King now?” Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>“The Blood Moon pursued you?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao was startled, muttering, “When activating the Five Elements Crown, one person controls it while others assist. The controller is most affected, so we took turns.  Hui Guang Saint was controlling it when we reached our limit and were about to switch to Qing Hu Saint King. That's when Guixu convulsed. We and the Crown were scattered, flung into a spatial fissure. I could only protect myself against the spatial currents, then a terrifying suction pulled me in. I lost consciousness from severe injuries. Before I fainted, I only saw Hui Guang Saint swept away by the spatial currents and vanish instantly.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  He’d hoped to settle an old score with Hui Guang Saint.</p><p>Being swept away at their weakest moment, the odds of a powerful cultivator surviving were slim.</p><p>Even if Hui Guang Saint survived, it was uncertain where they were taken, making another meeting unlikely.</p><p>Seeing Mo Xingdao only mention Hui Guang Saint and not Qing Hu Saint King, Qin Sang asked about her; his grudge with her was deeper.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said he didn't know, "Qing Hu Saint King was not far from me and still strong. If she was drawn into this realm, her chances of survival are high.  Someone recently reported a tribulation at a place called Ju Shan, and I suspected it was her."</p><p>After clarifying the time and location, Qin Sang was surprised.  He’d chosen a secluded spot for his tribulation and someone had still witnessed it.</p><p>Qin Sang admitted it was him, glancing towards the stone pavilion, "So, the person who saved you was Honghuyu Zhenren?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Mo Xingdao then relayed Honghuyu's speculations to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, glancing around. "You suspect the altar at Jushan and Gui Xu are connected?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded. "Back then, I thought I was flung into a spatial rift. Now, it's questionable.  Just now, I went deep into the altar with Hong Yuzi and found many similarities between the Ascension Path and this place. Perhaps..."</p><p>He paused, his tone filled with wonder. "We didn't fall into a spatial rift at all, but an ancient power's ability, connecting two worlds! Even if not, the two worlds are definitely closely connected, not far apart. If we can pinpoint the location from my last memory, we might be able to return to the Ascension Path and get back on track!"</p><p>"Find the Waymarker Gate…"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>He had painstakingly sought ascension qualifications, and just as he was about to succeed, he received clues to the Ascension Path.</p><p>"Aren't you afraid the Blood Moon is guarding the Waymarker Gate?" Qin Sang's tone was unusual.</p><p>It had been confirmed that the Heavenly Dao demonic sound came from a living being. Qin Sang even suspected that the storm zone was a hunting ground for demons, and all previous ascendants were devoured by this demon.</p><p>This guess was terrifying, and Qin Sang didn't dare think about it further.</p><p>"Didn't you say the demon chased you into the spatial rift and was swept away by the spatial storm? Even if the demon returns…"</p><p>Mo Xingdao paused, his voice filled with killing intent. "Opening a passage between the two worlds is a chance to use the Daoist masters to slay the demon! I followed Hong Yuzi for many years and heard him confirm that in the Dao Court's altars, the Da Zhenren are only in charge of the altar, while only True Lords can lead a province, wielding the Seal of Merit and commanding all the immortals!"</p><p>True Lord, a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang heard confirmation that such powerful cultivators existed in this world, and that both courts of the Dao Court had them stationed.</p><p>If even True Lords weren't the demon's match, it would be utterly hopeless, leaving the people of the Storm World without any hope.</p><p>According to Mo Xingdao, this world wasn't a Great Thousand World; the true Great Thousand World was behind the Waymarker Gate.</p><p>In this world, Qin Sang felt a constant sense of oppression.  If he could leave and solve the Storm World's problems, he would be overjoyed.</p><p>Falling into this world unexpectedly, he thought he'd never see Liuli again, but it seemed fate had other plans.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had another question. "Why did you deliberately avoid others and tell me these secrets, Daoist Mo?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao was saved by Hong Yuzi, followed him for years, and now protects him, showing Hong Yuzi's trust.</p><p>Relying on the Dao Court's strength, the hope of finding the Ascension Path is greater. Why secretly seek him out, a solitary individual?</p><p>Mo Xingdao was silent for a moment. "Daoist Qin and I are from the same place. I believe we can work together and you'll help me. Besides, you probably don't want to reveal your true origins.  As for the Dao Court, I have a feeling Hong Yuzi isn't that interested in the Ascension Path. His goal remains Gui Fang Nation. The secrets I know are what Hong Yuzi wanted me to know. This world isn't that simple.  How big the Source of Evil and Sea of Evil are, and where they end, no one knows. Perhaps this world is no less impressive than the world behind the Waymarker Gate."</p><p>There was another, more important reason.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said coldly, "I don't want to be controlled all my life!"</p><p>Hearing this, and recalling Mo Xingdao's behavior in the stone pavilion, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Clearly, when he was saved by Hong Yuzi, it wasn't without a price.</p><p>A Nascent Soul puppet – even a Nine Heavens Golden Que Censor couldn't ignore that.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious. After long contemplation, he cautiously said, "Daoist Mo, you want me to secretly search for the Ascension Path with you and use the Waymarker Gate to break free?"</p><p>This was assuming the demon had left the Storm World.</p><p>If the demon was still there, this would be diverting trouble, allowing Mo Xingdao to escape during the Dao Court's battle with the demon.</p><p>"Hong Yuzi is very shrewd. Without this, I would have no hope," Mo Xingdao affirmed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. Mo Xingdao and Hong Yuzi's power difference was too great; he could only rely on external forces.</p><p>Should he cooperate with Mo Xingdao?</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons and decided the benefits outweighed the risks.</p><p>This world was problematic. One day, when he became stronger and discovered the truth of this world, some trouble would be unavoidable. The Ascension Path was a way out.</p><p>After ascension, he could continue his cultivation and gradually explore.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang nodded slightly. "It won't be convenient for Daoist Mo to meet with me again, so what instructions do you have?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao already had a plan. "These years, I've been preparing. I'll give you a way to contact me secretly, but don't do it too often."</p>
