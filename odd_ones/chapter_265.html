     <p class="calibre5">
      A paralyzing feeling passed through Han Xiao’s body, and it made
                him much more focused. When he stretched out his arms, he found
                out that his body had become much tougher. His chest even gave
                off satisfying echoes when he gave it some test smacks.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Looks like I’m progressing well on the road to become a true
                  meat shield.
      </em>
      Han Xiao was in a good mood as he was very glad about the
                mission reward this time around.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had obtained his second Molding Ability. True damage was
                damage that directly reduced one’s health regardless of other
                defensive stats. For example, when a normal attack with a
                hundred attack power landed on someone, it would be reduced by a
                certain amount depending on the armor that the assailant wore.
                On the other hand, true damage would be able to do a hundred
                flat damage without reductions.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With this ability, he was much harder to kill and was starting
                to look more and more like a BOSS character.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After maxing out his [Magnetic Ring Mechanic] class in the
                interface, Han Xiao still had 125,000,000 experience points
                left, which he used to directly max out [Machinery – Last
                Stance] and [Repel – Thorns]. After spending another 13,000,000
                exp, he gained two additional Potential Points.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Both of these abilities were very useful. [Machinery – Last
                Stance] was self-explanatory—it was basically like combat Viagra
                for Mechanics. [Repel – Thorns] was a very powerful defensive
                skill as it could directly mitigate a portion of all incoming
                damage.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Maxing out [Magnetic Ring Mechanic] also unlocked the new class
                change requirements.

     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Well that’s surprising.
      </em>
      Han Xiao’s
                eyes flashed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Several of the class change requirements for main classes were
                the same for everyone. Han Xiao had class-changed four times and
                had [Mechanic Novice], [Novice Technician], [Mechanic Trainee],
                and [Magnetic Ring Mechanic]. All Mechanic players who went with
                the Magnetic Ring class change tree would have to complete the
                same requirements.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Only when they had learned enough advanced knowledge and leveled
                up intelligence enough would they be able to move onto the next
                level.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       My intelligence stat has already reached 321 points. With 40
                  free points, I now only need 39 stat points to meet this
                  requirement. So, the important thing now is to look for a
                  sub-class to max to obtain Level 80 overall.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Even someone like Han Xiao who basically only assigned points
                into intelligence did not have enough to do the class change. It
                was even worse for the Mechanic players who did not know any
                better and put points randomly into different areas. These
                players would have no other choice but to arduously look for
                more subclasses to gain stat points from.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The cap on Version 2.0 was Level 90. The higher the overall level,
                the higher the required experience to level up one’s
                sub-classes. This was why the later one fulfilled one’s class
                change requirements, the higher the cost would be.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Eventually, when a player’s sub-classes’ levels made up most of
                their overall level, their actual strength would then be
                laughable.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the past, some Galaxy players had only been able to meet
                their class change requirements once they got to Level 80. Before
                they could level up their main class after the class change,
                they soon ran into the Version’s level cap. Unsurprisingly,
                these players were the weakest when it came to PVP.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao threw in all forty of the unassigned points into
                intelligence and muttered, “I also need to find a subclass. My
                strength has already far surpassed the Version cap, so I don’t
                need to focus on leveling up anymore for now. Hmm… I should try
                to look for one of the rarer sub-classes. Those tend to give
                more free skill points per level, so I will be able to class
                change without leveling up too much.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was not worried about obtaining advanced mechanical
                knowledge. It seemed hard because the rate of his growth had
                already surpassed the norm in the current Version. Advanced
                knowledge was something that would come by sooner or later.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Hey, Black Phantom. Can I have my weapon back?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Someone called Han Xiao from behind him. Havalen had walked over
                as he asked Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was the mechanical pugilist who owned the rocket-boosted
                hammer. The hammer was still with Han Xiao at the moment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao turned and replied, “Oh this! I gave it a small check
                before, and it seemed like your weapon wasn’t functioning
                properly. Let me help you repair it first.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Or in Han Xiao’s mind…
      <em class="calibre7">
       You can have it back after I’ve figured out the blueprint for
                  this thing.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Havalen had a face full of suspicion. “There’s a malfunction?
                But it worked fine when I was using it.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Oh, you know, damaging weapons is often unavoidable during
                intense battles.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Uh, this weapon was developed by Theseus’s military factory,
                and I was ordered not to let anything about the technology leak
                out…” Havalen was troubled. He knew that Han Xiao was a
                Mechanic, so he was naturally concerned.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “That’s not right,” Han Xiao replied in a righteous voice. “Do I
                look like that kind of person? We’re teammates right now, you
                and I!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was not feeling guilty about this at all. Teammates
                were supposed to be used, or what difference would they have
                from fish in the market?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Havalen hesitated for a few seconds before finally relenting,
                and he returned to where was previously.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He did not believe a word Han Xiao said, but the thing was, this
                dude was much stronger than every other person present.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      What could he do?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Six Nations’ agents were busy reporting the current
                situation to their higher ups. All the nations had their full
                attention on this issue. Han Xiao did not really mind. He might
                as well let the Six Nations people know how strong he was so as
                to avoid any misunderstandings in the future.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao saw that Bennett was huddled up and talking with a
                small circle of people, so he walked over. He noticed that they
                were clamoring over a wheel that had fallen off and asked,
                “What’s this about?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I’m not sure if you have noticed, but we’re trying to fix this
                wheel,” Bennett said in a salty voice.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao looked at him weirdly. “I have eyes. Are you taking the
                piss with me?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The two stared at each other before Hannes could not stand it
                anymore and butted in to explain, “This wheel had been shot.
                There are some tools in the trunk. Do you think you could help
                us fix it? You’re a Mechanic, right?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You should’ve said that earlier.” Han Xiao pulled up his
                sleeves, took out his tools, and started fixing the wheel while
                making a bunch of clanking noises. The group of people just
                stood around him and gawked like a bunch of fools.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After Han Xiao was done, Hannes reattached the wheel onto the
                car. Bennett then finally looked at Han Xiao and signaled before
                he walked off to the side. Han Xiao shook his head a few times
                before he followed behind helplessly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The debt collector was finally here.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Once they were a distance away from the campsite, Bennett
                stopped, and so did Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Humph!” Bennett turned before staring at Han Xiao and said,
                “Explain yourself.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Obviously, he was talking about Han Xiao’s double identity.
                Bennett still could not get over it.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was delighted upon hearing this. Bennett sounded just
                like a pouting daughter-in-law…
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “So, you don’t want to talk about it? Do you see yourself right
                now? Oh… you think you’re so tough?” Thinking back to what had
                happened over the past few days pissed Bennett off. “Why not
                tell us that you’re an alien as well?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was speechless.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       You might’ve guessed right…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, Han Xiao was extremely thick-skinned, and no matter how
                much Bennett whined and complained, Han Xiao only gave off an
                occasional “huh” to let the other person know that he was still
                listening. When he saw how Han Xiao was not willing to speak at
                all, Bennett also felt helpless about it and sighed before
                saying, “Whatever, it’s all in the past anyway.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was a friend and someone who had made great
                contributions to the Dark Net. He had also devoted himself to
                the Shelter plan, and Bennett trusted him completely. He would
                not fuss too much over something like this. Moreover, Bennett
                secretly respected Han Xiao for his accomplishments.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bennett coughed a few times before saying in a muffled voice,
                “You… how did you break past the limit?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As a superhuman, he also wanted to become stronger. Bennett
                wanted to ask about Han Xiao’s experience in hopes of gaining
                some enlightenment for himself. He actually did not care about
                being surpassed by Han Xiao or any of that. Bennett had never
                been one to not care about these small things, and he had always
                lived life by trusting his friends. Han Xiao was one such
                friend. Although this youngling would irk him from time to time,
                he was still a likeable helper.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao thought for a bit before replying with a straight face,
                “Like the old teachings… First, take in a deep breath but wait.
                You also need to start circulating energy around your nether
                region. You know where I’m talking about, right? So basically,
                your bladder. You will then start to feel like energy is slowly
                leaking out of you, but don’t worry, this is common for all
                beginners. Once you can control this feeling and hold the energy
                from leaking on will, you will be able to break through your
                limit. It’s as easy as that.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “… You’re bullsh*tting me again, right?” Bennett was shocked. He
                had a mouthful of inelegant terms stuck in his mouth, waiting to
                be spit out.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Why do you never change! Do I look that gullible to you‽
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At that moment, the two suddenly quieted down as they noticed
                that someone was approaching—it was Hannes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Hannes swept his eyes across the two and said in a grave voice,
                “I have something to tell you guys. I might’ve found the
                Germinal leader’s origins.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The duo was shocked, and their expressions drastically changed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He is as powerful as me,” Bennett said. “This kind of character
                definitely can’t just be some random hooligan, but I have no
                impression of him at all. It’s very odd.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “So where is he from?” Han Xiao asked curiously.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Black Phantom… Oh, I will just call you Han Xiao. Do you still
                remember the mission we left for you?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded. The hidden A-rank main storyline mission [New
                Ear – Origin]’s objective was to dig up the buried past of
                Planet Aquamarine. He had broken down the mission into different
                portions and assigned pro Galaxy players to deal with the
                mission. The first part of the mission had already been
                completed, but Han Xiao just had not turned it in.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He never would have thought that the leader had something to do
                with the hidden main storyline, and this instantly piqued his
                interest.
