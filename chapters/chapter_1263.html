<h1>Chapter 1255: Corpse Flower Blood Amber</h1><p>Using the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld as bait to fish, only to end up losing it all and being outsmarted by someone else, was not a situation Qin Sang found amusing. The fat chicken, on the other hand, was utterly terrified, lamenting the treacherous nature of the world.</p><p>"Is there someone in this Black Tower Grand Array who has survived from ancient times to the present?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>Having rescued Bai, experienced the demonic calamity of the Seven Slaughter Palace, awakened the residual shadow of the Azure Luan, and witnessed the bone array left by a mysterious figure at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters, Qin Sang had grown accustomed to such bizarre occurrences. The anomalies in the Purple Micro Palace had far-reaching consequences, stirring up ancient restrictions and unleashing a host of malevolent beings.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a mix of emotions—joy and worry. He was pleased that more ancient cultivators were emerging, as some among them surely knew the secrets of the past. However, he was also concerned. If another ruthless demon lord were to appear, the North Star Realm had no Divine Transformation cultivators to step in and seal the demon lord away again. The entire realm would be plunged into chaos.</p><p>The Blood Lake was both a perilous land and a treasure trove. It housed the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld, the Boiling Blood Evil Flower, and spiritual herbs that attracted Jingyu. What made it even more valuable was that few had ever set foot here. Qin Sang wondered how much Ye Laomo and his ilk knew about this place. Did they know about the ancient cultivator lurking here, a hidden danger? Could it be that they were targeting this ancient cultivator?</p><p>It was possible for a few individuals to be deceived, but Qin Sang refused to believe that all the cultivators of the Sin Abyss had lost their minds, helping Ye Laomo release an ancient demon unless they had received some prior information.</p><p>"I don't know the origins of that person. Perhaps they are the ancient cultivator you mentioned, or perhaps they are a senior who once stumbled in here and became trapped. But this person is malicious, filled with ill intent toward me. They are no benevolent figure!" Jingyu said bitterly.</p><p>Back then, what had drawn Jingyu was a spiritual object known as the Corpse Flower Blood Amber. The conditions for its formation were extremely stringent. It required a place of extreme yin and dense blood energy, where several rare and unique spiritual flowers would grow. After these flowers bloomed, if they were left unpicked and did not wither, over time they would absorb too much blood energy, gradually crystallizing and transforming, shedding impurities to become something akin to amber.</p><p>Resembling a gemstone, it was also a spiritual herb for demonic beasts. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber contained blood poison, which humans avoided like the plague. However, powerful demonic beasts on the verge of a breakthrough could directly consume it. After refining it, they could forcefully stimulate their bloodline power, seeking a breakthrough opportunity. However, if their strength was insufficient, they would fall victim to the blood poison, dying on the spot with no hope of rescue. It was both a spiritual herb and a deadly poison, something demonic beasts both loved and feared.</p><p>"I was drawn here by the fluctuations of the Blood Lake's seal. I saw several phantom images of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber floating on the lake, on the verge of shattering. Noticing that the Blood Lake's seal had loosened, I thought it was a heaven-sent opportunity. I joined forces with another demonic beast who lived in seclusion in the Endless Valley, and together we broke the seal to enter…" Jingyu recounted, narrating her previous experiences.</p><p>The Blood Lake's seal experienced disturbances every ten years. Over time, they had grown accustomed to it and no longer found it strange. This time, however, the tremors were just a bit stronger. After Jingyu entered, she saw the true form of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber floating at the center of the basin, within the Black Tower Array.</p><p>Unable to retrieve the Corpse Flower Blood Amber from a distance, they had no choice but to enter the basin themselves and find it. At that time, the restrictions on the Blood Gate were not as strong as they are now. After the two demonic beasts attacked for a while, they managed to pry open a gap and sneak in.</p><p>After falling into the Black Tower Grand Array, the two demonic beasts avoided the flesh puppets and searched the area. They eventually found the center of the array and were on the verge of collecting the Corpse Flower Blood Amber when they suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>"We had been stuck at a bottleneck for too long and were blinded by greed. We ignored so many anomalies along the way. I don't know if he lured us in to trick us into helping him break the seal or to use us as blood sacrifices. When he realized we had caught on, he immediately bared his fangs. I am naturally skilled in thunder escape, and though I was severely injured, I managed to escape. He was sealed, yet he could control the flesh puppets here, hunting us down relentlessly. When I finally found the Blood Gate, it was tightly shut, and I had no strength left to open it. Fortunately, he couldn't cause trouble indefinitely. I struggled to survive in the Black Tower Array until he fell asleep. As for my companion, his whereabouts remain unknown. He never appeared again."</p><p>Jingyu sighed softly, then continued, "I was severely injured and spent my time recovering while searching for a way out. After that, he would awaken every ten years. Even with a decade between awakenings, it was difficult for me to recover in such a yin and evil place. My condition worsened over time. Later, I accidentally discovered this hidden prison. By then, I was on the verge of death. Though I knew the prison might not be safe, I had no other choice…"</p><p>As she spoke, Jingyu gently patted the fat chicken's head and said softly, "Heaven has been kind to me. The prison's restrictions only trapped me without harming me, allowing us to reunite."</p><p>Though Jingyu recounted her experiences in a calm tone, both Qin Sang and the fat chicken could sense the heart-pounding intensity of her ordeal. Escaping the clutches of evil only to be trapped in a hidden prison, possibly never to break free—what despair that must have been!</p><p>After hearing Jingyu's story, Qin Sang still knew little about the ancient cultivator sealed here.</p><p>"The Blood Lake's seal experiences disturbances every ten years. Is that the person trying to break the seal? If he can control the flesh puppets, why doesn't he use them to attack the seal or go out to hunt for blood sacrifices?" Qin Sang asked, puzzled.</p><p>Jingyu recalled, "From what I observed, the flesh puppets likely don't belong to that person. They were born from the Black Tower Grand Array, and he somehow forcibly controlled them. Even if controlled, these puppets can't harm the array or the seal, and they probably can't leave the array's range."</p><p>"That makes sense," Qin Sang nodded, then frowned. "However, so many cultivators from both regions have entered, and the flesh puppets have shown no unusual activity. I also haven't received any warnings from the Netherworld Demon Lord. We were forced to separate, yet that person didn't take the opportunity to capture blood sacrifices. Is he sleeping too soundly, or is there another scheme at play?"</p><p>Jingyu thought for a moment and said solemnly, "Perhaps it's not that he won't, but that he can't."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Qin Sang asked, surprised.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Jingyu's eyes. "Before I hid in the prison, I noticed that the number of flesh puppets he controlled was decreasing each time. Even in the prison, I could sense the fluctuations caused by his attempts to break the seal. The last two times he should have awakened, there was no movement at all…"</p><p>"You mean…"</p><p>"Even if he isn't dead, he's on the verge of it!" Jingyu declared firmly.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang understood what Ye Laomo was scheming. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber alone wasn't worth such a massive effort. The Sin Abyss must have learned about the ancient cultivator sealed within the Blood Lake. An ancient cultivator on the brink of death—what a treasure trove that would be! The only question was whether they would succeed in imprisoning the ancient cultivator or if the ancient cultivator would seize the opportunity to break free and unleash a calamity.</p><p>Having witnessed the Demon Lord with his own eyes, Qin Sang still felt a lingering fear.</p>
