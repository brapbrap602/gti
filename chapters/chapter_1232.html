<h1>Chapter 1224: Agreement (Additional Chapter for the Alliance Leader, Wang Duoyu of Qidian!)</h1><p>Xiang Qing's expression changed drastically.  </p><p>The Divine Peak was the foundation of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. The arrangements he had made to stabilize morale and prevent outsiders from exploiting it had been seen through at a glance.  </p><p>Bing Han's eyes lit up. "Does the Daoist also excel in the art of flame manipulation?"  </p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded. "This humble Daoist has some insights into this path."  </p><p>Xiang Qing's face shifted through a myriad of emotions as he stared at Qin Sang for a long time. Finally, he snorted coldly, "Since this is a transaction, what do you want?"  </p><p>"This humble Daoist merely wishes to collect a portion of the Ancestral Sacred Flame. Fellow Daoist Xiang should be well aware that, for you, the Ancestral Sacred Flame is now more of a liability than an asset—like a chicken rib."  </p><p>Qin Sang's tone was sincere.  </p><p>Bing Han's eyes flickered, but she remained silent, lost in thought.  </p><p>The Ancestral Sacred Flame was left behind by the founding ancestor of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. The decision could only be made by Xiang Qing; she could not overstep her bounds.  </p><p>Xiang Qing sneered, "Just collecting the Ancestral Sacred Flame? Daoist, since you can see through the formation, you should know how terrifying the power contained within the Ancestral Sacred Flame is, no? Otherwise, it wouldn't fall to you. Even collecting just a portion could elevate your strength by several levels."  </p><p>Qin Sang admitted frankly, "It is indeed a mutual benefit. This humble Daoist also risks backlash from the spiritual flame. Without any gain, would I simply serve Fellow Daoist for nothing?"  </p><p>Xiang Qing paced back and forth. To Qin Sang's surprise, he actually refused.  </p><p>"Even if the Azure Sun Demon Sect and the Divine Peak were to be destroyed together, Xiang would never aid the enemy! If Daoist wishes to make a deal, it's best to be straightforward!"  </p><p>Bing Han was also taken aback, but she didn't believe that a Nascent Soul cultivator would appear out of nowhere. She watched Qin Sang with curiosity.  </p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, "I'm afraid that if I reveal my true form, Fellow Daoist Xiang will be even less willing to agree."  </p><p>As he spoke, a green light shimmered around Qin Sang, and a pair of magnificent phoenix wings suddenly unfurled from his back. Bing Han's eyes filled with awe.  </p><p>"Demon King Mingyue?" Xiang Qing exclaimed, his face full of shock.  </p><p>Bing Han suddenly understood, "So that's how it is. I heard that Fellow Daoist wields the Twelve Flame Banners, possibly modeled after the Ten Yama Banners of the Ancestor Kuiyin, with two additional banners. I originally thought that, like Ancestor Kuiyin, you sealed the spiritual flames within the treasures and couldn't control them directly. But now it seems that you can control the flames yourself, which is why you can wield so many banners with ease?"  </p><p>It seemed she had specifically studied Qin Sang's Twelve Demon Banners.  </p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't reveal the difficulties of cultivating the "Seed of Golden Lotus." He nodded in acknowledgment and said to Xiang Qing, "Back then, before I had fully transformed, I was not very mobile. I used some minor tricks to deceive a few rogue cultivators into forming the Demon Flame Sect to serve me. I didn't expect them to make a name for themselves. There's still some sentiment there, so I wish to take them back under my wing. Fellow Daoist Xiang won't mind, will you?"  </p><p>Xiang Qing forced a bitter smile, "Fellow Daoist disguised yourself as a human, with not a trace of demonic aura. Xiang never expected it to be you. Fellow Daoist has aided the Two Realms Alliance greatly. If you have something to say, just speak directly. Why go through all this trouble?"  </p><p>"I wish to use the Ancestral Sacred Flame to refine my flame banners, making them easier to control in the future. But I was concerned that, given the differences between humans and demons, the two of you might harbor reservations."  </p><p>Qin Sang presented his prepared explanation, thinking to himself, *What if you've already resolved the issue and reject my proposal? If I've already exposed my intentions, how will I plan for the future?*  </p><p>"It's said that the power of Daoist's Twelve Flame Banners rivals that of top-grade treasures. Can they still be improved?" Bing Han exclaimed, covering her mouth in surprise.  </p><p>Xiang Qing was also secretly alarmed, growing more wary of Qin Sang and the demon realm. He wondered if it was the right choice to help the demons increase their strength.  </p><p>However, in terms of overall strength, the demons were far inferior to humans and could only occupy a corner of the world.  </p><p>The greatest conflict in the current cultivation world was not between races but came from the Sin Abyss. Qin Sang had stationed himself at the Threefold Pass, first slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss, then venturing into the Abyssal Ruins and bringing back news of the Blood Lake. At least for now, they were still allies.  </p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang added something that made it impossible for him to refuse, "The journey to the Blood Lake is imminent. I am also preparing for it. In the unknown depths of the Blood Lake, facing the Demon Lord Ye, one can never be too cautious. I dare not guarantee complete safety. Fellow Daoist Xiang, don't you want to resolve your worries before setting out?"  </p><p>These words struck a nerve with Xiang Qing.  </p><p>He knew how difficult it was to cultivate a Nascent Soul cultivator. If something were to happen to him before he could suppress the Ancestral Sacred Flame, it would be even more impossible for his descendants to do so.  </p><p>It was foreseeable that they would be forced to relocate their sect.  </p><p>Without the endless Azure Sun Divine Energy from the Divine Peak, unless the Azure Sun Demon Sect could find a new source, their legacy would be severed.  </p><p>Xiang Qing was a decisive man. He didn't waste Qin Sang's breath and agreed, as long as Qin Sang vowed not to act recklessly, to let him try.  </p><p>Bing Han clapped her hands and smiled, "Fellow Daoist Xiang and I have racked our brains but couldn't suppress the Ancestral Sacred Flame. Now, it's up to Demon King Mingyue's abilities."  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile.  </p><p>Refining the Ancestral Sacred Flame and cultivating the "Seed of Golden Lotus" was now his only option. He couldn't help but feel relieved that the matter was settled so quickly.  </p><p>The three acted swiftly. After finishing the fine wine in their cups, Xiang Qing led Qin Sang to the Divine Peak.  </p><p>Qin Sang had once refined a piece of Divine Jade, triggering the formation and nearly causing the Ancestral Sacred Flame to go out of control.  </p><p>This time, he was very careful, listening to Xiang Qing's explanations while observing, deepening his understanding.  </p><p>When they reached the peak, Xiang Qing raised his hand, and a ball of Azure Sun Demon Flame gathered in his palm, forming a flame seal that he struck toward the formation. The green mist parted, revealing a narrow passage.  </p><p>Qin Sang observed how Xiang Qing controlled the Azure Sun Demon Flame, which was different from how he manipulated it through the demon banners.  </p><p>The Azure Sun Demon Flame was like a part of Xiang Qing's body, seamlessly integrated without any barriers.  </p><p>*Once I cultivate the 'Seed of Golden Lotus,' I should be able to achieve the same,* Qin Sang thought to himself.  </p><p>As they delved deeper into the formation, the sight before Qin Sang shocked him.  </p><p>The green mist blotted out the sky.  </p><p>Within the mist, there was a complex formation entirely made of Azure Sun Divine Jade, shaped like a square jade platform.  </p><p>Above the platform, a flame danced—the Ancestral Sacred Flame.  </p><p>Surprisingly, the body of the Ancestral Sacred Flame was humanoid, resembling a sentient spiritual flame with limbs and facial features, though it was only half the height of a person.  </p><p>Xiang Qing said, "Fellow Daoist, don't be fooled by its appearance. The Ancestral Sacred Flame is not a living being. It only took on a humanoid form because of the lingering aura of our ancestor and subsequent changes."  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang cultivates a related technique, and your sect has secret arts for refining flame seeds. Can't you directly subdue the Ancestral Sacred Flame?" Qin Sang asked, voicing his doubts.  </p><p>Xiang Qing sighed softly, "Perhaps it could have been done when our ancestor first passed. But now, it's too late. The Ancestral Sacred Flame was sealed by our ancestor at the peak of the Divine Peak. Unexpectedly, it began to absorb the free Azure Sun Divine Energy and other auras from the surroundings, causing its nature to change and become increasingly volatile. Over time, when our ancestors realized something was wrong, it was already too late to reverse. They could only let the Ancestral Sacred Flame develop. The current Ancestral Sacred Flame is entirely different from what our ancestor left behind. Even with my Nascent Soul cultivation, I dare not act rashly... Fellow Daoist, how confident are you?"  </p><p>---  </p><p>---  </p><p>Apologies for the delay over the past few days. Things will get even busier, so I'll make up for it quickly.</p>
