<h1>Chapter 2009: Lotus City</h1><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light, capable of concealing tool spirits, was undoubtedly a supreme treasure that every Refinement Master dreamed of.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously felt that the Unending Blood Mulberry somewhat failed to live up to its reputation. From magical treasures to spiritual treasures, and even to the level of Postnatal Spiritual Treasures, the effect of the Blood Defilement Divine Light had clearly weakened. It was no longer possible to directly cripple an opponent's reliance during a fight and achieve a decisive victory as it once could.</p><p>It turned out that this was the true reason why the Unending Blood Mulberry was ranked among the Ten Great Divine Trees.</p><p>Recalling the battle in front of the Purple Star Palace, Old Devil Ye and Zui Yuan had truly wasted a precious treasure.</p><p>However, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Storm Realm could not possibly come into contact with tool spirits. For them, the greatest value of the Unending Blood Mulberry was ironically its most useless aspect. Whether or not it was a waste was truly a matter of perspective.</p><p>He had originally thought that before reviving the Purple Star lineage, he would have to be extremely cautious and his Cloud Wanderer Sword would remain dormant. Unexpectedly, there was a twist of fate, and it could even become his aid in the path of Refinement.</p><p>"I wonder what kind of secret art is required to refine the Blood Defilement Divine Light. It's probably not easy, and it must be treasured by various sects, unlikely to be passed on easily."</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought flash through his mind and subtly inquired.</p><p>As expected, Elder Qi didn't understand such secret arts. This kind of secret art was impossible to be widely spread in the Great Thousand World. Moreover, the Ten Great Divine Trees were extremely rare. With the secret art but no divine tree, as time went on, it would only be tossed into a corner, neglected by all.</p><p>Compared to finding an Unending Blood Mulberry, finding the secret art was undoubtedly much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Elder Qi that the Five Elements Alliance had collected a great many refinement secret arts and tool path inheritances over the years. After making certain contributions to the Five Elements Alliance, Guest Elders were qualified to peruse them, and obtain one or even several from them. This was also one of the Five Elements Alliance's methods of attracting people.</p><p>The so-called contributions were evaluated from many aspects. The safest was naturally to refine more treasures for the Five Elements Alliance, but it would consume time.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even if the Five Elements Alliance possessed such secret arts, they would likely not be easily accessible, and he couldn't be impatient.</p><p>Through Elder Qi, Qin Sang not only learned many secrets but also gained a deeper understanding of some of the common rules of the Refinement path in the Great Thousand World, making it much easier for him to act in the future.</p><p>Just as the two were talking excitedly, the restriction outside was triggered, and Steward Zhao's voice came through, "Elder Qi, there's a talisman message from headquarters."</p><p>"It should be news from the alliance," Elder Qi stood up, "Fellow Daoist Qin, please remain calm."</p><p>After leaving for a short while, Elder Qi returned to the quiet room with a smile and offered congratulations, "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Qin! As expected, the alliance will not refuse any Refinement Grandmaster. As long as Fellow Daoist is willing to join the Five Elements Alliance, we will certainly keep a position open for you and offer you the token of a Guest Elder. In the future, Fellow Daoist only needs to hold this token, and regardless of time, place, or branch, you can mobilize the power of the branch for assistance! However, before sending out the elder token, we need Fellow Daoist to do something for the alliance to prove your ability."</p><p>"That's only natural. I wonder what I need to do?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked. The whole process was easier than he had expected. He guessed that they would ask him to refine a spiritual treasure or something similar.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang guessed, Elder Qi said, "According to the usual practice, the alliance should send other elders to meet Fellow Daoist Qin. However, due to a major event that the alliance is currently busy with, the elders in Jade Capital City are all occupied and temporarily unable to come. Please forgive us for the lack of etiquette. Next, Fellow Daoist only needs to refine a few treasures at this branch. After the treasures are refined, the alliance will pay Fellow Daoist the same reward as other Guest Elders. If Fellow Daoist has no other requests, I will immediately arrange a refinement room and have the alliance send the spiritual materials."</p><p>The purpose of this trip was to obtain an elder token; the reward was secondary.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, "How long will it take to refine those treasures?"</p><p>Refinement, especially of spiritual treasures, often took years. He was afraid that delaying here for too long would affect his sword retrieval plan.</p><p>As Sword Slave had said, this struggle for the Zhou King's lifespan, attracting the attention of the world, was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "The Zhou King has passed away, and the new king has yet to be established. Undercurrents are surging in Jade Capital. I'm worried that great chaos will erupt, so I want to leave this place of strife as soon as possible."</p><p>"Unless someone wants to usurp the Zhou King's title, how could chaos erupt in White Jade Capital? The mighty figures above are still arguing endlessly. It will likely be at least ten or eight years before it affects us. However, Fellow Daoist Qin's worries are not entirely unfounded..."</p><p>Elder Qi didn't seem too concerned and calculated silently, "If Fellow Daoist is in a hurry to leave, half a year should be enough."</p><p>The time required was shorter than expected, and Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Elder Qi led Qin Sang out of the quiet room and towards the back hall, "The alliance has Five Elements Refinement Rooms and some special refinement rooms. Which kind does Fellow Daoist choose?"</p><p>"I'm accustomed to fire," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Elder Qi was not surprised. There were refinement traditions for all five elements in the world, each with its own characteristics, among which fire was the most common.</p><p>Arriving at a Fire Room, Elder Qi left Qin Sang and went out for a while, returning with a wooden ring.</p><p>A simple character 'Wood' was carved on the ring.</p><p>"The spiritual materials and blueprints are all in this ring. If Fellow Daoist has any questions, I'll be there," Elder Qi pointed to a refinement room on the left and took his leave.</p><p>Activating the grand formation, he sealed off the inside and outside.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the wooden ring, and rows of neatly arranged spiritual materials came into view.</p><p>Unexpectedly, these spiritual materials weren't particularly rare, but the variety was exceptionally diverse, dazzling to the eye.</p><p>At the very back, Qin Sang saw a scroll made of an unknown beast hide.</p><p>Taking out the scroll and unfolding it before him, an extremely intricate blueprint appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Qin Sang saw the clue at a glance, "It seems to be a magical artifact! No, it's part of some kind of magical artifact!"</p><p>He hadn't expected the Five Elements Alliance to ask him to refine a magical artifact instead of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Certain special magical artifacts could also possess extraordinary power, and their refinement difficulty was no less than that of spiritual treasures, or even higher. The large flying magical artifacts popular in the Moonfall Bay also belonged to this category.</p><p>There were three diagrams on the blueprint, depicting three beast heads: a dragon head, a tiger head, and a phoenix beak.</p><p>Of course, they had nothing to do with true divine beasts, but simply borrowed their forms. The structures of the three beast heads were largely similar, the key being the internal rune restrictions and construction.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over it briefly, and could only describe it with one word -- exquisite!</p><p>No wonder a Refinement Grandmaster was needed.</p><p>There were all sorts of spiritual materials, including those with conflicting properties, which required exquisite refinement techniques to be refined into various components and assembled into a whole.  Not only did they have to avoid conflicts and bear rune restrictions, but they also had to transform the mundane into the magical, achieving a complementary effect.</p><p>The number of components in just one beast head, ranging from the size of a human body to as small as dust particles, was unimaginable. The refinement might not take too long, but it was a great test of the Refinement Master's control.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guarantee success every time, but fortunately, the Five Elements Alliance had provided surplus materials.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance's arrangement was also very clever. By dividing a magical artifact into separate parts, and refining each part independently, the Refinement Master couldn't deduce what the magical artifact was based on just the parts they knew.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the part assigned to him was probably the easier part. The main body of the magical artifact was definitely more complex, and the elders of the Five Elements Alliance were refining this magical artifact together, which was why they couldn't get away.</p><p>Putting aside distracting thoughts, Qin Sang immersed his mind in the blueprint and began to comprehend it seriously. He then started with the simplest components, refining and exploring as he went.</p><p>During the refinement period, Qin Sang left the Five Elements Alliance several times to meet with Sword Slave and explain the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that completing the Five Elements Alliance's task would require six months to a year, which was still acceptable.</p><p>After all, he needed to contact Celestial Master Tian Yue before taking further action, and then wait for Celestial Master Tian Yue to make proper arrangements.  The actual operation might not happen until much later.</p><p>After agreeing on a departure time with Sword Slave to avoid implicating him, the two would try to meet less frequently and maintain their disguises.</p><p>Six months later.</p><p>Inside the Five Elements Alliance Refinement Room.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, surrounded by a sea of fire, with a fire dragon circling above his head.</p><p>The fire dragon coiled around a mass of golden liquid, continuously refining impurities. Golden patterns gradually emerged within, and then the patterns were extracted, forming extremely fine golden threads. When a complete golden thread was extracted, the liquid completely lost its luster.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The golden thread suddenly straightened, and then with a flick of his sleeve, countless components exploded before him with a 'bang.'</p><p>The golden thread moved like a needle and thread, rapidly traversing between these components. In the blink of an eye, it formed the outline of a tiger's head, which suddenly opened its eyes, radiating a fierce light.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn. He flicked his fingers repeatedly, sending streams of light continuously into the tiger's head.  The fierce light finally gradually subsided, eventually forming a tiger's head the size of half the Fire Room.</p><p>Its mouth was wide open, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>Facing the tiger's mouth directly gave one a sense of danger, as if a fierce attack would erupt from it.</p><p>"Could it be a cannon's muzzle?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered but didn't delve too deeply. After adjusting his breath, he continued refining.</p><p>In the tenth month, Qin Sang finally refined one dragon head, one tiger head, and one phoenix beak. He then invited Elder Qi over.</p><p>The three beast heads were sufficient to prove his skill. Refining more would earn him more rewards, but Qin Sang couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>"Elder Qin's skill is truly profound!" Elder Qi commented upon seeing the three beast heads, directly addressing him as 'Elder.'</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, during the refinement process, Qin Sang had spared no effort in expending his vital essence, incorporating the blood refinement techniques of the Profound Mystery Sect, aiming to make the Five Elements Alliance value him more.</p><p>Elder Qi collected the three beast heads, "Since Elder Qin is leaving, I won't waste any more words. There will be plenty of time in the future. What reward does Elder Qin intend to claim this time? I will report it all together."</p><p>"Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk. How much can you give me?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk was an indispensable spiritual material for constructing Daoist altars, and the required quantity was much less than that of Azure Mark Primordial Essence.</p><p>"Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk..."</p><p>Elder Qi pondered for a moment, "Generally around three zhang, but I can try to secure five zhang for Elder Qin. Elder Qin has recently joined the alliance, so they will likely be accommodating to show their generosity."</p><p>"In that case, I thank Elder Qi," Qin Sang expressed his gratitude.</p><p>"It's a small matter," Elder Qi waved his hand casually, "Elder Qin, please await my good news."</p><p>Not long after, Elder Qi returned, indeed bringing back five zhang of Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk and an elder token.</p><p>The Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk resembled thin ropes, multicolored and vibrant, as if woven from countless bird feathers.</p><p>Azure Mark Primordial Essence, Thousand Feather Spiritual Silk...</p><p>He had already obtained two. By collecting them one by one, he would eventually be able to construct his own altar.</p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries with Elder Qi, Qin Sang left the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>By now, Sword Slave had already requested leave from the Zhou King's Palace, disguised himself, and was waiting for Qin Sang to depart.</p><p>After they met, Sword Slave, disguised as Qin Sang's disciple, walked towards a mansion in the Thirtieth Heaven.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived as a rogue cultivator, but left as a Guest Elder of the Five Elements Alliance. The fee for the Great Teleportation Formation was indeed reduced significantly. Qin Sang paid some Rainbow Silver and boarded the Great Teleportation Formation with Sword Slave.</p><p>However, they only had one jade talisman. During the teleportation, Qin Sang had to use his stronger magical power to protect both himself and Sword Slave.</p><p>As they left White Jade Capital, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a sense of emotion. He had originally wanted to properly admire the human race's sacred ground and plan his future path, but unexpectedly, he had come and gone in a hurry, spending his time in White Jade Capital entirely refining within the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>...</p><p>'Pitter-patter...'</p><p>Riding the Great Teleportation Formation, they teleported from White Jade Capital to the Dui Prefecture City.</p><p>When Qin Sang and Sword Slave stepped out of the Great Teleportation Formation, the first thing they felt was the humid air. The sound of raindrops hitting the water and lotus leaves reached their ears.</p><p>The sky was gloomy and overcast.</p><p>Dense, impenetrable clouds covered all directions. The rain drizzled continuously, neither heavy nor light, not a downpour, but the rain was like an unshakeable melancholy, as if it would never cease.</p><p>It was said that the weather in the Dui Prefecture region was always like this, with almost the entire prefecture located within a boundless great swamp.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his feet, which rested upon emerald green lotus leaves. The backs of the lotus leaves were pressed tightly against the water's surface, like green plates floating on the water, never sinking, and exceptionally tough.</p><p>Looking around, countless lotus leaves covered every direction. These 'lotus leaves' varied in size, some actually being duckweed, stretching to the horizon, where countless green dots still remained.</p><p>This was one of the Eight Great Celestial Prefectures, the prefecture city of Dui, a celestial city built upon lotus leaves and duckweed, spread across the surface of the swamp!</p><p>Thus, it earned the name -- Lotus City.</p><p>These lotuses were called Clear King Lotuses, a rare variety. Their leaves ranged from several zhang to even thousands or tens of thousands of zhang in size. It was said that they only grew in the capital city of Dui Prefecture and would wither if taken elsewhere. Mortals who consumed their seeds could prolong their lifespan. The lotus leaves were a tough spiritual material, and pavilions and buildings built upon them wouldn't collapse.</p><p>Lotus City wasn't entirely flat. The lotus leaves varied in height, connected by arched bridges made of lotus stems, forming a beautiful and varied landscape.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the water surface of Lotus City was only one zhang deep above the swamp below.</p><p>But standing here, he couldn't smell the slightest trace of decay, only the refreshing fragrance of lotus leaves.</p><p>Even more peculiar was that for countless years, the clouds above Dui Prefecture had never dispersed, and the rain had fallen continuously. Endless rainwater fell to the ground, yet the water level never rose or fell.</p><p>As Qin Sang shifted his foot, the lotus leaf beneath him trembled slightly, sending ripples across the water's surface.</p>
